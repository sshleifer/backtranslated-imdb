I do not understand people. Why is this movie getting a 8.3 !!!!!! ???? I had high hopes for this movie, but since I had about half an hour I just wanted to leave the theater. In the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they have seen (or summer, year, etc.). They say that is a great conclusion. WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? What has been completed (besides the fact that Bourne can ride a motorbike, shoot and fight better than anyone else I meet)? What do you learn about the Bourne character in this movie ????????? Absolutely f ****** nothing !!!!!!! Okay, there's a lot of action, but what's so good about the action in this movie? I do not like cinematography and movie editing. The shaky camera effect and the rapidly changing shots were heavily used and they get old fast (I did not care about them in Supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not overused) and made me very dizzy. I was quickly wishing I had saved my $$$ for something else. <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot. This whole movie is a 115-minute chase. Bourne, about whom you learn nothing in every 115 minutes of the movie, is a perfectionist in everything he tries. There is absolutely no character development in this movie, you know nothing about anyone, and there are a wide variety of new characters that are introduced in this part. Some people have said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense. ??????????? !!!!!!!! What to write ???? What suspense ??? There is no suspense. Bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does, I guess he has nothing to worry about. If this is the best movie of the year 2007 I can just go out watching movies entirely !!!! <br /> <br /> Many people also said that Matt Damon's performance in this film is one of the best (if not the best) of his career. What performance ?? How many lines did he have in this movie ??? I have some respect for Damon because he has been in movies that I liked and played with different types of characters, but a good actor is someone you can barely recognize from one movie to another, someone who chooses different types of roles. It's not someone who plays the same roles over and over again (which Damon does not do, but an example of someone doing it is Vin Diesel). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie was a big disappointment to me. I do not recommend this movie, but I recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I definitely recommend reading the three books (which are very different than the movies).
