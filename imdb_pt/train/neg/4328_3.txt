Any film with "National Lampoon" in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It may be an institution in the US, but it is virtually unknown in Europe. to the larger audience. "It is unlikely that the European holiday of National Lampoon" rectifies this situation. The terrible Griswalds are just that - terrifying. They are not funny. Clearly, Mr. Chevy Chase thinks he's funny, after all, Miss. B.di Angelo laughs a lot of his jokes but she is being paid for it and did not have to shell out Â£ 2.50 for the privilege. The section marked in England is typical. The same old TV artists, Mr. Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M. Lippman, take the same old old tired cliches, Mr. Chase gets lost in the hotel corridor ... yawn. , yawn, yawn .. Bucking - ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated I've never seen bobbies on bikes two-by-two ......... rosie red cheeks on the little chil - Drain, I need to continue? The English are buffoons, the French addicted to the Yankee language. The Germans are pompous and bloated, (do not mention the war, Clark), and the Italians devouring their feet. Did I forget something? Every possible "comic" situation is worked to the death, Mr. Chase is agitated desperately, Miss di Angelo contracts sweetly, children are embarrassingly bad. The fact that this franchise has lasted so long should bring comfort to those who claim that you never lose money by underestimating the taste of the public.
