I usually do not comment anything (I read the opinions of others) ... but this, I have to comment ... I was convinced to watch this movie through worlds like action, F-117 and other high tech things. , but only for a few minutes and I changed my mind ... Bad acting, bad script and a great science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... do not bother ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing , before any movie I usually check user reviews and ratings on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this movie a try, now I'm wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ??? ???????
