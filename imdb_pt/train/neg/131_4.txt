So where are the cannibals? Those puzzled by the title and appeal of the 'real cannibal' of this film will be disappointed. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his re-visit of a Papua New Guinea village full of natives, one of whom was his mistress several decades before. The man, Tobias Schneebaum is Jewish from New York when they come and somehow, this is interspersed with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes. <br /> <br /> There are no real cannibals here: just stories relayed by some of the natives and Tobias himself. Not all together a bad movie. Very interesting and great cinematography. Schneebaum remains highly agreeable and gives us a fascinating glimpse into a life as far from Western civilization as possible. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly what she claims to be on the cover and the plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
