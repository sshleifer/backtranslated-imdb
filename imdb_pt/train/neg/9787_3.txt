... but the problem with this production is that it is far from being a good musical. <br /> <br /> It is true that spiritist masters such as Sondheim, Bernstein, or Porter can not always be expected; however, the music of this play even makes Andrew Lloyd Webber look spirited. It is deathly monotonous and uninspiring (with one or two exceptions), and shortly after I watched it, I could not remember a single meaningful melody - which is quite tragic coming from someone who has learned the whole Another Hundred People in three tapping . <br /> <br /> It's also strangely non-theatrical. It happens on an incredibly large stage (you really need to feel sorry for the people in the first rows that broke your neck to see something going on 50 meters to the right or 100 meters to the left) and does absolutely nothing with it. When there should be a person singing on stage, that's exactly what you get - and the rest of the huge stage is empty. For me, as an aspiring theater director, it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> The fact is that Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his works better than these nonexistent talents can get close. And I'm intrigued by the popularity of this musical that would be legendary.
