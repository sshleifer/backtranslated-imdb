Out of the sky, a gang of naked, horny female angels (with large plastic fangs) set up residence in a scary forest where they feed on any unfortunate souls they should walk. Is not it long before a group of friends on a road trip to fall victim to the bloodthirsty babies? An independent low budget horror made in the UK, Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and releases down the pan with some of the worst acting, effects and direction I have seen in a long time. Director Johannes Roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera? the scenes in the dilapidated house are quite tense and there are a few moments of 'shock' cleverly manipulated - but for the most part the film is technically amateur. Play some really horrible performances from the horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have a bad movie in your hands. <br /> <br /> A little fun can be derived from the film's sheer craze, and there are lots of female nudity for the guys to savor, but most will find this a daunting task.
