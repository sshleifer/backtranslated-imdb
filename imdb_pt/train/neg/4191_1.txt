I have seen many horror films in my time, all absurdly bad, but none reaches the depths with which this piece of garbage is reduced. This movie made me furious and furious as I watched as I tried to figure out exactly what this movie was. Now, after I've seen it, I understand - more or less - what was happening and why, but the movie itself is too confusing to be nice when you're watching. Yes, there are usual scenes of gratuitous violence, phrases that show the insightful insight of your characters ("The road belongs to me ... ME!") And nudity enough to distract us enough from the "plot", but you will still let this movie feel alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy that is no longer sought after and is left in a box by the side of the road.
