I saw this by chance showing on the wanted cable wanted how I thought Sandra was very funny of what I remembered. The only facial movement I had over the course of the movie was jaw dropping to see how horrible a movie I just went through. <br /> <br /> The person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time, please indicate a line, just a scene, it's worth a laugh. <br /> <br /> She's a much better singer than I remember her, but I did not want to watch a show. <br /> I think this is a difficult movie to like, since they think they should and do not see it objectively.
