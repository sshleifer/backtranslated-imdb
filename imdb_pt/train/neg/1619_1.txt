At the beginning of the film, the beautiful photograph and scenes of the fox were incredible. However, the story was very slow and boring. And then the girl starts taming the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see foxes. One thing that someone should know is that you leave the wild animals wild and enjoy them from afar. This film gives a terrible example to the children who will be watching, trying to turn a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the purpose of the story was. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the girl was still wanting to play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes with predatory animals for the fox, which only increases the trauma inflicted on the children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a horrible story that counts. The final dialogue narrated was so stupid, when my wife and I were screaming on TV! I hated this movie, and would never recommend it to anyone!
