This was a disappointing movie. Considering the material - army life is always good for a laugh - and the stars, this movie should have been a laughing party. It was worth a few laughs, at best. Steve Martin has been a lot funnier than that and it looks like Dan Ackroyd should hold dramatic roles where he can follow the lead of Robin Williams and one day win an Oscar.
