Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land doing self-mutilation shows as a way to deal with his abusive childhood. I use the word "apparently" because without hearing the comment from director Andy Copp (which I had not available to me) or reading the movie before watching, viewers have no idea what it is. Gorehounds and extreme movie buffs may be drawn to watch The Mutation Man with the promise of some gruesome scenes from astonishing and disturbing real-life footage, but unless they also enjoy pretentious and headache-inducing scenes. , the experimental art cinema, they will find this a real task to sit on. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly pictures accompanied by cluttered sounds, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogues, mind-numbingly horrible nonsense is the perfect way to test a person's sanity: if you still have all your marbles, turn off that garbage and watch something decent (I watched the whole thing, but I'm well aware that I'm barking through). !)
