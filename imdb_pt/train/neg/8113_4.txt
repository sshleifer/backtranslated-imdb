POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE'S ENGINE COMPANY **; GETTING POPEYE'S GOAT ** 1/2 I used to do this as a kid, but by taking an episode of the series that includes three consecutive cartoons, ie several years later (they preceded theatrical screening of the RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they can not handle it very well! The character of Popeye is not exactly nice to begin with, Olive Oyl clearly arrogant and Bluto's antics did not get to arouse much interest either ?? In short, the scripts were alarmingly thin, rather horrible, and generally bland. They are strictly juvenile, but I doubt that the children of today would have the patience to keep them! moreover, the style of animation is not attractive. <br /> <br /> Taking each of them short, I think they have improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, it has adapted to its mediocre quality so to speak, third drawing easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot ?? Popeye is in charge of an army mascot goat whose immense appetite does him no harm (hardly original, I know, but always a fun maneuver). An interesting element here was that the short ones were accompanied with Popeye delivering pieces of moralistic wisdom to the children in the audience.
