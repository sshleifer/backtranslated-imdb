Until this new season I have been a big fan of 'Little Mosque'. However, the new season ruined everything. <br /> <br /> The new Christian vicar destroyed all the intention of the spectacle. It has always been about living together to overcome prejudice. The new vicar ruin this premise and shows the Christians in a very bad light. <br /> <br /> I am neither a Christian nor a Muslim, but I loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend. No longer. <br /> <br /> Just cancel and end it. Not worth watching anymore. <br /> <br /> It can still be saved, but much change needs to be made. <br /> <br /> Bring back the old format.
