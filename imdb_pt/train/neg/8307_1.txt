This show is unbelievable in that. . . what it represents and what it focuses on. . . words can not describe how insane ET is. They will report anything. If a celebrity is, even remotely, indirectly connected to the story, ET will report it. If a dog poop in Tom Cruise's backyard they will report it. If a celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for weeks on end to the point where the public envies this celebrity. If a celebrity is on trial. . . ET will report it for months on end. There is no end to what this program will report and no deadline dictating how long they will focus on a story. Is it really considered newsworthiness? The reports are so annoying too, with harsh voices, and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of importance. I can not watch this show without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is a great reason to avoid pre-night shows in general. I regret that the IMDb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even the negatives. For this show, they deserve -10 stars.
