This is certainly one of the worst films ever made and released by a major Hollywood studio. The plot is just plain stupid. The dialogue is written in clich√©s; you can complete many sentences in the script because of this. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of Rod Cameron. The "choreography" is silly and totally unerotic. One can only pity the critic who saw Yvonne's 23-year-old dance as sexual; it's just a very bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is especially ridiculous. If you like bad movies and like to laugh at some Hollywood turkeys, this is for you. I bought the color version on VHS, making the movie even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, makes her look like a clown all the time. And she's the best part of this movie. What a way to launch a career.
