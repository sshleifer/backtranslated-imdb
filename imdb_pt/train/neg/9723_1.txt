Jeux d'enfants or how the film was mistranslated into English Love Me If You Dare is a movie made by stupid people and stupid people. I just do not know how I could expect something worthy of being seen from a movie with such a plot: Two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that every one of them will do something (certainly extremely dumb) to prove to each other (wtf?) That they are "cool guys". I know I've exaggerated some aspects, but that's what the whole movie is about. They grow older ... and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things thinking that they are great people. <br /> <br /> You can expect such a movie from Hollywood, but France? It's even more offensive to watch the country movie that created Amelie a few years ago, which, by the way, the film tries to look like, but it's far, far away. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
