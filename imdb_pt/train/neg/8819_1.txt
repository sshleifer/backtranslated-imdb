This is arguably the most horrible stupidest piece I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is that a guy goes crazy and dresses up in Santa Claus and kills people because he saw his mother. give your father oral sex while he was clothed in a holy clause. Is that why he went crazy? Is it just me or is this the worst reason for someone to go crazy like never before? and that's not the only thing. I'm serious when I say NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE DAMN. nothing until 1 hour and 15 minutes passed. <br /> <br /> There is a whole scene where he glues a beard from Santa Claus on him. IT'S A LONG FRIGGIN MINUTE. WHO HELL WANTS TO SEE WHAT? However, I must say that the end of this movie made me spoil the laughing myself. So whether you see this movie on TV or something like that come back in 1 hour and 20 minutes just to watch, undoubtedly the worst end of all the movie history. and I'm serious about it. <br /> <br /> It's not so good, it's bad, it's tedious, it's stupid, it made me want to break the VCR. it's just not worth your time too I'm sure all the other reviews have mentioned this, but the actress who played the mother in Home Improvement was in this movie for a fraction of a second. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW THE BAD THAT THIS MOVIE IS? I would watch an improvement at home for sixty-six hours, so even look at this film cover forever again.
