There are probably more people who are afraid of the dentist than, say, scary monsters or dolls. Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, actually. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool man he grabs, and he brings his anger and frustration to their work. Well, give a crazy dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what happens next ... <br /> <br /> Like I said, brilliant idea, but not delivered as well as it should. In particular, the ending is a huge disappointment. Last remark: note Mark Ruffalo (You can count on me, Eternal Sunshine ...) in this. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
