I do not think I've ever felt this disappointed by a movie before. After loving two previous Guy Ritchie movies (I did not count Swept Away - he was a blind man), I was so eager to see it. <br /> <br /> The reviews were bad, so again, I do not trust the press anyway. Most troubling was the fact that the buzz of the internet was that this was a bit bad, so it was with some apprehension that I handed over my Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to explain this movie, mainly because I have no idea what was going on and at one point I was honestly close to getting up and asking if it was just me who did not understand! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself too seriously. It seems that it was not good enough for him to make movies with good plots, laughter, dialogue and good characters. It's almost as if he had a list of movies he wanted to rip off, here are some of the ones I noticed: The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, Time Suspects, Vanuatu from Heaven. I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good and was really the self-indulgent story and editing / direction that left the film down. <br /> <br /> So, a big, big thumbs down from me.
