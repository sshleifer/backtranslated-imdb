For the first 20 minutes (I was watching on a PS2, so I really have no idea how long it took) Alienator sets out an interesting premise. I do not think I've seen a horror movie with an alien from another planet as the wicked one before. However, interest soon turns into disbelief when you realize that the 'alien' is a huge woman in a steel bikini. Yes, the Alienator is patently ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Do not think I have this against it. In the world of horror-clich√©, patently ridiculous can be a good sign. However, the blatant stupidity of her premise is that the whole movie is really going for it. Alienator is funny as hell, but it is also a chaotic suckfest of the highest order. Actors huddle in failed attempts at seriousness, potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogues are stumbled with disconcerting incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one decent piece or two. When the movie ends, you can barely see the original concept through the total gut that the staff put into it. <br /> <br /> Add to this the fact that the 'Alien' just kills people by vaporizing them, as opposed to doing any 'butchery' as such and you have a lot of good ideas being left to rot . You'll laugh at Alienator, but not at this. If that's your thing, then go ahead and check it out.
