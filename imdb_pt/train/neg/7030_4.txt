One of the pillars of low budget cinema is to take a well-known and classic plot and make it a complete bastardization. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The screenplay takes the long-running plot of Phantom of the Opera and takes it to an 80's mall. However, the goal of the "Phantom" now is simply to avenge those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family. Special effects provide a good laugh especially when the body parts begin to appear on the yogurt countertop dishes. Pauly Shore has a small role that does not allow him to be as obnoxious as one would expect, mainly due to the fact that his 15 minutes of fame on MTV have not yet arrived. If you're looking for some good laughs at the expense of the actors and the special effects team, check out this movie. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
