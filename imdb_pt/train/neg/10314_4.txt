As someone who likes to chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating real-life story, I was optimistic about getting into that movie, but a lot of obstacles hampered the good story it should have been. <br /> <br /> THE BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he's played, but his role here is insipid as an insurance investigator. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is insipid and the beautiful Kathryn Harrold. it's the real dump. From what I read, there were several directors replacing each other in this movie, and that's too bad. You can say things are not okay with the story. I could not get "involved" with Williams' Cooper portrait, either. It should have been fascinating, but he was not in this movie. It's also a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some kind of "popular hero," but I'll admit that I ended up cheering for the guy as well. <br /> <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can not complain about the landscape, from Oregon's lush green forests to the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie redone and made better because it is a one-of-a-kind story.
