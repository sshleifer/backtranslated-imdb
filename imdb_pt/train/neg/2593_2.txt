American Pie: Beta House is a kind of limbo between genders. On the one hand, it's a comedy without plot and few genuinely clever jokes. On the other hand, it's a porn that's a little too soft to really connect any viewer. Essentially, Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, some just humorous - with a pair of fine points in a cohesive effort. The characters are almost two-dimensional, most of the development depends on the knowledge of Naked Mile, and the scenes of "important" scenarios are so far away that you wonder why the writers felt the need for a story. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I did not get into this movie without expectations. I liked the three original American Pie movies, and I thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid locations. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, and then when I saw that some of the same characters were coming back to Beta House, I was excited to see that part. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I was okay with it, because in the past, these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. At Beta House, though, it's almost as if the writers had forgotten why the formula in the other AP films worked. They spent a lot of energy working on nudity that they neglected to actually write a story. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a dollar rent. The jokes are lame, the story is non-existent and the pornographic aspect is very tame, if that's what you really want to see.
