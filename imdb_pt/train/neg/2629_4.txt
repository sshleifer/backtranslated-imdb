Hollow point is a certain movie worth a half price lease or if nothing else is in a good time waster without thought necessary. There are the explosions required and the girls are actresses and beautiful. A good cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and the lovely Aunt Carrere. This cast plus a light touch of heart makes for a not a great movie but a fun .. on a scale of one to ten .. a 4
