I watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and I like to watch a few movies made about people with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. His message about the disabled and the life span he spent struggling for the disabled to be recognized and integrated into the traditional society's job market is great. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, which I found insulting. <br /> <br /> First of all, they have not pitched anyone in a title role with a real physical disability. . Of course they were competent actors but it seems completely genuine to preach about hiring people with disabilities and then not hire the DEFICIENCY for anything in the movie. Further aggravated by the fact that in a scene in the middle of the film a man is seen walking to a podium with crutches, appearing to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so apparent that it is shameful. What? They could not find a real amputee anywhere for the movie? For a shot of 5 seconds, was it more financially sound to make CGI effects than just hiring a REAL amputee? At that point in the movie I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message I was trying to convey that I came here to complain and whine about it as the pathetic cripple I am. <br /> Find out.
