I just saw this movie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006 and it makes me think seriously if people at the festival actually show the movies before selecting them. The movie was just horrible - I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful. The days of Matthew Modine as leader are outdated. Gina Gershon had an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a small appearance - she too should be ashamed. The script was terrible and we were given no reason to worry about the characters. I highly doubt that this is caught, but again, people in Hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes. I really think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie I've ever seen.
