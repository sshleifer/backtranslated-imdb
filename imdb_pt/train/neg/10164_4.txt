I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival, and I can not decide on that. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to worry about them. Maybe that was the point, we're all in a "bubble" of our own, but these people did not force me to be worried about them or shocked at their various destinies. At an execution time of just over an hour, the characters were not very well developed. A lot of time was dedicated to shots of manufacturing equipment (forklifts, conveyors, shovels); and the slightly frightening-looking puppets with surprisingly vivid eyes that most of the characters made their living were somehow more interesting than the living people. An interesting experiment, but somehow never came.
