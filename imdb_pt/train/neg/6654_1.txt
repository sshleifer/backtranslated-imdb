Normally, I do not think Hollywood productions are suitable for being called movies, so I call them 'movies'. But this piece of elephant dung, is not even apt to be called a movie, hence the quotations in the title. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of the geriatric cast, it certainly is the epitome of it. Stefanie Powers must play someone less than half her age, she must play an 18 year old, and she is FORTY effing TWO !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. A horrible stupid stupid picture of Paris and France, where we see clich√© characters such as: the cute grumpy store owner, the model bitch queen, the fairy mother of god ex-queen models , etc. This film is only surpassed in this respect by the Da Vinci Code, (which the reviewers correctly determined was a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is highly ridiculous not to have nudity in a movie about a time and a place where nudity was such a common place, especially if the whole focus is on it. <br /> <br /> 4. The horrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The Nana Mouskouri lift music !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think that's enough. And I could make those observations after watching that crap for only half an hour while surfing the internet and chatting with my friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
