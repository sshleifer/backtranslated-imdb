To me, this movie seemed to fall on your face. The main problem for me was the cast of Glover as a serial killer. I do not know whether this is derived from modeling or simply his conduct, but I doubt that Glover can portray a compelling villain. He's a cool guy, and that's always obvious in his performances. Other than that, the movie is your serial killer story. Nothing very innovative.
