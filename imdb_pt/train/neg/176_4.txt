<br /> <br /> I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel. It happened just after the first. For some reason, this movie kept me interested. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- Ok ... It was tacky how this guy got involved with making the movie. In the first film, he had a "reason" to kill people, but in that sequence, half of the murders / assassination attempts were basically for no reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co-writer due to creative differences, but what was the problem in trying to kill the cast? No cast, no movie. Did he want it to "look real when they died?" If this was to be a high budget movie, use the special effects, MAN. Of course, like the first, the captured girl flees and Stanley ends up getting confused and disappears. Woooooow (sarcasm) This movie had potential. And the saddest thing of all ... the really sad part ... I watched "Hut by the lake 3". Just because I like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part about that sequence.
