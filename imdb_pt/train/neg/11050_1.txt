Terrible use of cutscenes. All continuity is lost, either by terrible plotting or lethargic direction. That villainous robot ... must have been a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard (monologues usually muffled by music.) And ... where did they get their props? That ship looks like a box of milk ... I made better special effects at 8mm at the age of 13! <br /> <br /> I would recommend any movie student to watch this movie (5 minutes at a time), then learn how not to produce a movie. Or ... was it the publishers fault? <br /> <br /> It's really too bad, because the scenery was really a good concept ... just barely running all the way around. (Excuse Malcolm.) You should have sent a "stunt double." You're a very good actor for such a stinking bomb.)
