I loved the first movie "Azumi". I saw Mrs. Ueto in a variety of her TV appearances and I saw my fair share of samurai and ninja movies. I have to say that this movie was much weaker than I expected. Given the cast of the film and created in "Azumi", they should have been able to do a much better job with this film. but instead it was slow, dragging itself in pieces and sprinkled with a very poor, unconvincing and wooden performance. When they bothered to refer to the first movie, they did it quite freely. is weak. In "Azumi," the title character is the best of a group of top killers. In "Azumi 2," it seems somewhat diminished and less impressive. <br /> <br /> That does not mean it was a total loss. There were some decent fighting scenes and some exaggerated characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers in general by the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The latter two actually captured the "manga" in their script, while the former never "understood".
