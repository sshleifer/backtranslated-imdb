Really bad movie, the story is very simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement. <br /> <br /> This vampire hunter story is the worst I've seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), travels to Mexico in search of some bloodsuckers !, he uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), and is part of the network of hunters of some vampire of Van Helsig, OK, but it works alone. He is assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen who is looking for some black crucifix to perform a ritual that will allow him to be invulnerable in the sunlight (it is almost a continuation of Vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and starring James Woods) Derek begins his quest for the queen with some new friends: Sancho (a very bad acting Diego), an inexperienced teenager, Father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) a Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) a private vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary), another expert on vampire hunters. So obviously, on this adventure, he is not alone. <br /> <br /> You can begin to feel like this movie would just look at your lead actor (Jon Bon Jovi); is a huge difference in acting quality compared to James Woods, so if you watch the movie (I do not recommend this part), you'll get involved in one of the simplest, totally predictable stories with terrible acting performances, special effects very bad and incoherent events! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend not to see this movie !, rent another movie, see another channel, hang out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
