Jerry spies Tom listening to a scary story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his enemy. <br /> <br /> I did not find this particular episode so funny: the mood seemed a bit embarrassing and the whole scene was kind of lame (Jerry is essentially the 'villain' in this, tormenting poor Tom for no particular reason ). <br /> <br /> There is an occasional flash of inspiration (like Tom's literal 'heart-to-mouth' experience and the time when his nine lives are sucked out of his body), but overall, this effort does not have the frenetic pace, excellent animation and wit of most other T & J cartoons.
