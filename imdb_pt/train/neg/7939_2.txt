From the decrepit ranks of the already super-saturated subgenre "Hillybilly Horror," comes this lamentable tale of a vacationing family terrified by endogamous countrymen. Sound familiar? Well, it definitely should be for anyone with a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems content to recycle all the old and worn-out cliches (deformed countrymen, a peaceful family transformed into armed assassins when the push comes to show, the rebellious daughter, that "freak" that is good in the heart, etc ...) but does it without too much enthusiasm to make it a complete waste of time. This is a memorable oblivion, but the humorist led J.D. Hart once starred in a film called "Films that Suck" early in his career, a veritable omen. <br /> <br /> My notes: D-
