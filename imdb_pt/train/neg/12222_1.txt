(Honestly, Barbra, I know it's you who's singing all those "NO's" in my comment 22 times How many people did you have to instruct to help you here You have nothing better to do as you look at yourself in the mirror all day?) Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was "the best movie I've seen since 'Citizen Kane.'" This pretty much says it all - and serves as a terrible warning! <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients for a cinematic disaster unfailing, and one that will haunt you, never letting you forget the tears of both laughs. and pain? The ingredients: the face of Barbra Streisand, a musical, feminism, the voice of Barbra Streisand, the direction of Barbra Streisand and an ultra-tacky / idiot premise. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, that we know. In fact, almost everyone? by definition ?? has to be an egomaniac in Hollywood. Why would anyone want to act? For the "art"?!? Well, are you dumb enough to believe what they say in your carefully prepared interviews? And Streisand has the greatest ego of all! This is a great achievement. Be surrounded by narcissistic cretins and still manage to overcome them all? remarkable. <br /> <br /> The film, like all of its "solo" efforts, is an ego trip straight from hell. Each scene in which Streisand finds itself is automatically ruined. Stillbirth. But since that was not enough, she sings a lot of songs from Streisandy? you know, the kind that allowed Mariah Careys, Celine Dions, and the Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious airwaves for decades now. Just so she deserves not one, but 100 episodes of South Park mocking her. <br /> <br /> The premise, Streisand dress as a man to study to become a rabbi, sounds like a zaz comedy ZAZ. Aside from being a clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand does not look like a woman or look like a man? in fact, I'm not even sure if she's human. The way she looks in this movie, well? can not be described in words. E.T. looks like a high school athlete in comparison. She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in the year 2015. She looks HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The songs. They made me tremble. Particularly "Pope Can You Hear Me Squeel Like A Deming Female Walrus In The Heat?" and "Tomorrow night I will prepare the continuation, Y 2: The bitch return". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand considered having a nose job early in his career, but changed his mind. when they said that their voice could change? Can you believe that? She should have done it! Killing two flies with a blow is what it would have been. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by email. <br /> <br /> BARBRA STREISAND WILL FINALLY GO IN RETIREMENT? CLICK "YES" OR "NO".
