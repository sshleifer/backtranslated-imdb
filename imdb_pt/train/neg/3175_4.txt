"So there's this bride, you see, and she's crushed to death by this statue that falls on her on her wedding day. So take it, a year later, your ex-fianc√© falls in love with a beautiful psychic?" and then that beautiful psychic is haunted by the ghost of the dead and disgruntled bride who wants to stop her from stealing her boyfriend? He, he, it's going to be hilarious! "That, I like to imagine, is how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed of" Over Your Dead Body, "introduced his concept to studio executives at New Line Cinema. mystery is how these same corporate bigwigs could turn around and give the project a green light, allowing Lowell to direct the film as well as writing the screenplay. Well, if you do not think any movie could possibly be so Bad as this original premise sounds, then clearly you have another thought coming in. The only way this could have worked is if the writer simply went mad and turned into a satirical farce with no limits.Instead, wanting to make sure he presented a comedy romantic, diffused, harmless and warm, Lowell engages in boring half-measures every step of the way, repressing the absurdity in favor of a monotonous conventionality. In fact, "Over Your Dead Body" is so completely inept is in grace that it is difficult to know exactly where Lowell thought he was going with him. Virtually all the jokes, jokes and jokes in the film are boring and boring, even the actors seemingly aware of their situation. How else to explain the disheartened and lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proven their talents in better vehicles in the past (this is particularly the case with Rudd). But Lowell and the studio executives certainly have some splainin 'to do.
