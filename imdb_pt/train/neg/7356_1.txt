I entered this movie, just as it was beginning, on an afternoon when I was home with a touch of the flu - otherwise I would have missed it. That would probably have been the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good artists - and I thought this might be worth it. It proved to be to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories so horrible that fascinate. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talents except Jayne Mansfield - or Loni Anderson - breast. Unfortunately, his acting prowess - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson look like Garbo or Davis in comparison. <br /> <br /> The kitty's white cat, the owner's cat, the crazy young man having the owner dumped. and contained in his own house, and a lot of doophus (including the young sow's case) running around a biohazard facility and the absurd conclusion. I've been waiting for at least some scene or element of the plot to contain at least a modicum of realism, credibility, or to be able to evoke some empathy / sympathy - but that proved in vain.
