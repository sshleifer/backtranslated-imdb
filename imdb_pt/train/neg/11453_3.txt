This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever seen. I hate these robberies of Napoleon Dynamite. Just face the people that idiot humor has already been mastered. Do something new for the first time. All these new comedies are simply horrible. And coming out of the SNL, Andy Samberg is not ready for the lead role yet. I hope he can recover from this horrible movie. And the Arnetts character is just plain bad. Hey Will, did you read the script? The plot is truly the worst ever written. Now you tell me if this is weird. Rod Kimble's father, Frank, is dying and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod is planning this big jump to raise money for Frank. Just so Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his manhood. Yes, this is the movie, you tell me, you would spend $ 7.00 to see this piece of crap! <br /> <br /> 3/10 just awful <br /> <br /> -adam
