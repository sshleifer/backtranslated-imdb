*** Contains Spoilers *** I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I found it incredibly annoying and superficially done regardless of the importance and depth of the film. the proposed themes: since we eventually have to die, how should we approach life? In a "light" way, like Tomas; in a "heavy" way as Tereza; or should we find ways not to face this, like Sabina? How much loyalty is important in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be mutilated because of our loved ones? How much do we have to get involved in political life and social issues in our country? Unfortunately, I did not read Kundera's novel, but after being disappointed with the film, I certainly will: I want to understand if the story was ruined by the adaptation of the film (which is my guess) or It has been bland since the beginning. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with most of the positive comments that defined the film as a masterpiece. I just do not see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what drives them to make their choices. <br /> <br /> 2) The "secondary" characters are there just to fill in the gaps, but they add nothing to the story and you wonder if they really are needed. <br /> <br /> 3) I do not like how Tomas was represented. Nothing is good for him. He is so egocentric and selfish. He is not human, in a sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally attached to someone, I do not find the interpretation believable. <br /> <br /> 4) It is very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford to pay for her way of life in a communist country in 1968. In addition, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) How can Tereza effortlessly become a good photographer? b) how can they do it well in a country without all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The false accents of English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I'm not even a mother tongue. Also, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the film saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I think most of the film was filmed locally, so it is not difficult to give the film a feeling of Eastern European and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague, it is not difficult to make it look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the final kind of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far from the temptations of the "metropolio", distant from the social struggles that their fellow citizens live, disconnected from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after realizing that they are happy, in fact. And? If they had died unhappy, would the message of the film have been different? I think not. I considered it kind of a cheap trick to please the public. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the movie that is unbearably light is the way the director plays the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you're left with nothing. You do not feel empathy, you do not relate to them, you stand there on your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated to "stop the music in the restaurant scene (which some comments praised a lot)." Why does Sabina have such a strong reaction? The only thing you learn is that Sabina has a very bad temper and a very strong personality. <br /> <br /> What's so special and unique about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments , let me point out that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave two). The "Photoshoot of naked women", where the envy, jealousy and insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> The other scene is the one that represents the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. <br /> <br /> Tereza photos, taken to let the world know about what is happening in Prague, are used to identify the people who participate in the riots. I found this quite unique and the sense of despair and Tereza's guilt are well portrayed. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small possibility that the film has been intentionally "designed" in such a way that "Tomas types" like it and "Tereza's" will hate it. If this is the case (I highly doubt, however), then my comment should be revised drastically.
