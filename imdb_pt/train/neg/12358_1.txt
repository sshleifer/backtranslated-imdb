Demi Moore's character in the film was selected for SEALs because of their appearance. That was a bad start and the film fell from there. The plot was totally unbelievable. The will to do so in a hard military unit is not enough. This movie did not convince me of a woman's physical ability to perform the kinds of tasks required. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting.
