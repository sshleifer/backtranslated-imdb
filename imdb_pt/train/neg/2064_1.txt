Oh gosh. While Chevy Chase and the SNL class set new highs with sketch presentation format, that fails miserably at all levels. Fortunately, Chevy is barely there and can not be blamed for this total nonsense. It's seriously, really, really bad. Although it was a political commentary on the US at the time of its launch (1974), it is still neither funny nor sharply observed. The sketches are all very long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they are all drawn to the point of complete boredom. This is credited as the debut of the Chevy movie and I am pleased to say that everything he did after that improved. Avoid even being curious.
