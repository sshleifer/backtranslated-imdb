If it were not for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as the junkies with no concept, I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a 10-year high school reunion, which happens at a supposed high school drop-off (looks more like a prop for a low-budget horror movie of the 1950s) , and the disturbed pupil of the class made a very traumatic play. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters, since only one student is killed, as is the lunch girl (Anne Ramsey of the Goonies). We are led to believe that the horny couple is dead but never sees a damn thing! This is a horrible movie that continued the downward spiral of National Lampoon throughout the 80's and 90's.
