This week, I thought it would be fun to talk to Corey Haim, just having seen the two "Lost Boys" movies last week and all. Not that I'm a fan-boy - not from afar - but I liked those two Coreys in some movies early in my teens. <br /> <br /> So, I prepared myself for three films starring him. Unfortunately, I chose "Dream Machine" as a first (never seen this before), and it was so horribly horrible, I just decided to trap Corey in my closet and let him get sober again first, before appearing in something else of him. But I was able to fight this movie first. I got the impression that he desperately wanted to play in the same league as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986), but he got caught up in his own delusions. Pretty much the whole movie wants to be a comedy and almost at the end tries to be a thriller. The only good thing about "Dream Machine" is the premise: a corpse in the trunk of a Porsche. Everything else fails so much, it's embarrassing. Even more for Haim. I may discover that he is young and enthusiastic, but at least when he comes with some form of direction directives. This was clearly not the case in "Dream Machine". So we have a perfect car, yes, that black Porsche. Haim's perfect girlfriend? Just a blonde girl who has almost no lines in the movie. The perfect murder ... almost? Some guy who falls on his butt as the villain of the movie, trying the whole movie to steal the body back off the trunk, never really succeeds, and then at the end of the movie thinks he is Michael Myers (minus the white William Shatner Mask) and Corey Haim mistakes for Jamie Lee Curtis. Do not think they could have made this movie if they tried. A stupid and bland movie with a story that leads nowhere directed by a director who does not know how to direct his cast. Great done! One last question to Mr. Haim: What was the idea of ​​you smiling directly at the camera in that last scene of the movie? Yours or the director? So do not end it.
