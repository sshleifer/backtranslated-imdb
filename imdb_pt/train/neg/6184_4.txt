Brainless movie about a handsome but brainless couple who decide to live the dream and get people on diving trips. The pair almost instantly makes the wrong choice of customers and mingles with some people who seek to retrieve items that we see falling to the bottom of the ocean during the opening credits sequence. Great looking straight into the video movie could have been so much better had it not been so interested in looking good. Performances are useful and the plot is not really bad either, or it would have been the director and producers have not redirected the plot to make sure we see many people well dressed in swimsuits (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the "unrated "" moniker a few bare breasts breasts.) The movie never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie.If you get in the way of seeing this, you will not tear your eyes out because eye drops are nice, but we really need to stop producers from making movies that are an excuse to have paid vacations.
