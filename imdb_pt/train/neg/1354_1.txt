I saw his movie at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I am a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know a thing or two about the cinema. And Crispin Glover's film is outrageous. It basically explores the mentally challenged. Not only is Shirly Temple the anti-Christ (which I admit is a bit funny) telling those mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also toyed with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors who is how they are all, mentally challenged. PETA and Human Rights must be everywhere. It's not 'counterculture' as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it's holding.
