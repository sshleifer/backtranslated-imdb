Wow, how bad can it get. That was seriously bad. Not in terms of gore - which was mostly laughable CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible - the main character's character arc was a total joke. Within a few nights of chasing Vinnie Jones, he begins to get "haunted" to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend. Um ... are all New York photographers so childish, suggestible, and weak? Your character development had absolutely no justification or point - and in the end you will be laughing out loud at the totally predictable and totally absurd twist your character takes on. <br /> <br /> Bloody moments were clearly just a weak, low self-esteem effort to jump into the modern MTV car - all cgi, blood, but with no real emotion. These parts were, unintentionally, funny - and distracted by their self-awareness - strange camera angles, etc. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie commits the crime of blowing up another potential idea. What could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters in the end) is ruined in favor of the self-conscious style 'look at me' direction. This movie was not made for the public - it was made for a CV - a deeply selfish motive.
