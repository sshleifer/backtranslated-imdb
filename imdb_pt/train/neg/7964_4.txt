"Creepshow 2" is little more than a pale imitation of the original, designed with little purpose other than profiting from the name of the previous film. It even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor, which was often predictable and cumbersome. Still, the first time, there were enough emotions to make up for the periodic lulls, resulting in an uneven but rather fun endeavor. The sequel has few worthwhile moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more apparent. Once in a while, delivery, but most of the time, just stays there. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts. A wooden Indian comes alive, taking revenge on the murderers of his owner. Teens are devoured by an aquatic monster. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to chase after a careless driver. None of these premises are intrinsically bad in themselves, but they are totally devoid of inspiration. There are few surprises and no fright. This is an example of unmotivated movie book, by numbers. It does not help that this cheap-looking movie suffers from a simple steering style, though to be honest, there was not much to work with. In the end, the second story comes out better, but not much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performances are good at best. George Kennedy, like the ill-fated general store owner, does an adequate job if not particularly inspired. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is very good as the guilt-ridden driver, evoking sympathy for her situation despite the predictable and redundant material. However, most of the characters are quite thin overall. <br /> <br /> One would think that "Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who directed the original, re-wrote the script, based on more Stephen King stories. The makeup effects artist Tom Savini turns into a good and bloody job. So why is the movie a disappointment? I think Romero really did not want to make a second film, but was forced to do it for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror sequels, clones, robberies and everything else, so that was certainly inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry, taking his salary and running away. I think he had to do what was necessary to finance his own projects; we can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (out of house) <br /> <br /> Released by New World Pictures
