No doubt Tommy is the evil one here. I do not know why, but for some reason, small children in horror movies tend to come across the little girl's butt. and since they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well ... except for asylum of terror. but these are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Anyway, for the movie. Can not find this movie on DVD? Surely you can! all you have to do is buy the classic refrigeration DVD package! You not only get Metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 OTHER MOVIES! that bargain! mp. IT'S OK. I'm made advertising for these cheese movies. let's just say, this movie is not worth the $ 15 on its own. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemical scientist. yea. Because all chemical scientists look as handsome as this guy playing Peter. He is trying to create a serum to prevent body deterioration. the college in which he works wants to interrupt his project, so he tries on himself. but because this is a horror movie, it swallows dry and starts an incredibly long transformation sequence that takes up almost 3/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> To finalize the film, he enters into a relationship with a woman. who has a son. and she was never married! scandalous! But of course Tommy is one of the most annoying characters ... no. I'll take it back. He is the most annoying character. Much worse than the old cripple who wants to take over Peter's job and rejoices him while he's in the hospital. That's right, even as an old cripple, you can still be the villain. <br /> <br /> So we see Peter start randomly killing some people in visions he has until realize that he is the one to do it and just decides to kill everyone on his way back to normal. However, in the end, it ends up evolving into a lizard. Yes, I know, do not ask. The ending really does not make sense. And if you're expecting a really good reward, you will not be able to. <br /> <br /> This is not a HORRIBLE movie ... it is simply frustrating because of the lack of a good Pay. If you already have the 50 movie package and this is next on your list, you're not in the quest for a suspense, but it's not a great movie either. Just sit back, relax and eat a lot of snacks. Because this movie will not make you jump out of your skin anytime soon. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis catches 4 plastic lizard heads, 10.
