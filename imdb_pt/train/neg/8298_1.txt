This movie was not much fun, certainly not as original or as good as a Christmas story. The characters (except the younger ones) try to imitate the previous actors, and they fail. The country neighbors come out of nowhere because they were not part of the first film. This really sucked, could have been good with the original cast, then again, maybe not because the story is so weak. Skip this.
