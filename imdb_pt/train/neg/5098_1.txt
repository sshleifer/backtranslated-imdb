This has to be one of the best anime shows ever made. And yes, they even showed me the "End of the Gospel" and that still made me hate even more. Not to mention the countless abuses of this show! <br /> <br /> I do not care about psychology and philosophy, but Evangelion drags it into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones who seemed to be interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that, most people were a bunch of weeping losers. They need to go to a psychiatric center, not pilot giant robots against aliens called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even the fights of the mechs and aliens did not help at all. It goes something like this: "Well, there are these robots, and they're really cool because they bleed (!) When they get hurt, but they're not really wicks, but angels are captured, so sometimes they they go crazy and they do not do what the underage pilots want, and they have to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can not recommend Evangelion to anyone anime otakus or do not. For those who love this series very well, you are entitled to that opinion, I respect you. But for those who have an "out of your mind" obsession with thinking that everyone will like this series, you are more of a selfish one. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run" -Dim "and" Robot Taekwon V "myself.
