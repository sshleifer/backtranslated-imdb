Although not as bad as it was meant to be (I've seen MUCH worse), this is still a very lame movie. Basically a repeat of Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff", with the main difference being that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than all Joe Don Baker, an unpleasant actor if there was one. <br /> <br /> Venantino Venantini is great (and a lot of fun) like the bad guy, sort of a budget Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason to sit in this steampile, as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible performance, especially the girl. Poor Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe that he was once a romantic leader (see "Mondo Cane" to see him running away from women). Looking here as a second-rate Ben Gazzara, he gave almost nothing to do. It's all Joe Don show, unfortunately. And it all marked the music of action movies of the '80s that could not be more boring. Greydon Clark can make good B movies ("No warning"), but here he stumbles, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the places in Malta were good, and there's Venantini trying to save the day. 3/10
