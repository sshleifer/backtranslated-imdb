they have sex with melons in Asia. <br /> <br /> Okay. First, I doubted it, but after seeing the rebel cloud, I changed my mind and finally became convinced that they had sex with watermelons, with dead or living people. without safe sex, of course. the (main, terribly ugly) threw everything in the lady's mouth after he made the lady dead. have you ever heard of HIV? I think not. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is mostly boring but also incredibly revolting. In fact, in some parts it was so disgusting that I could not get my eyes blank. sex with dead people! How disgusting is that? and what is the message behind it all? we need water, we need melons, we need to be dead to have sex? Sorry, but that smells bad!
