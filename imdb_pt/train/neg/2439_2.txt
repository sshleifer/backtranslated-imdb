"Intensive Care" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror films ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch slasher film offers some absurd scenes and a lot of absurd situations. A veteran terrorist George Kennedy is completely wasted as Professor Bruckner. abysmal, the action is slow and the climax is laughable.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He stays in coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes in a bloody tumult. "Intensive Care" is clearly influenced by American horror films including "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" series. The killings are hilarious and the dialogues are painfully stupid. Still, if you're in the mood, you can give a look at this piece of crap. You'll laugh until you hurt with it you can believe me!
