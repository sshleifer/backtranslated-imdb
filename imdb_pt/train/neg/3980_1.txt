I am not kidding. If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in all, and consist only of traveling to foreign locations, having a problem that they solve easily, hoping to be popular and have new boyfriends. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie starring you with a different storyline, contact me and tell me his name. These "movies" are bad excuses for being on TV and going to other countries. There is a reason why movies never go to theaters. I'm sure when they were very young and did some OK. movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so now that they are, what, 17, they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using studio money. Let me advise you, STAY AWAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! IT'S BY YOUR OWN GOOD!
