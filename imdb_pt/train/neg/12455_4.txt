I remember watching it in prime time when I was about 7 years old. I was a great comic book reader at the time, and anything related to superheroes was to be expected. The end result, however, was disheartening. <br /> <br /> I was aware of Diana Prince's "Emma Peel" stories, as they had only recently ended and Diana returned to her Amazonian form. However, there was so little action that I was bored for most of the movie. The final costume was an interesting idea, but it looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in late adolescence. Not much improved. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to That's Incredible, but her acting was no better. The script had some good ideas, such as the dishonest Amazon, and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it did not come together and was still annoying. <br /> <br /> I think they should have built the back story better, and built the show into a more epic climax. It was very much like a bland spy movie, interspersed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. The elements of the Amazon were intriguing, but they needed to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film managed to force the producers to go back to the drawing board and think of something more faithful, albeit a little too much and with a low budget. . The budget was also low here, and superheroes are not cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD, just as a comparative and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and there is nothing about this movie (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is worth seeing for curiosity and for a little inspiration and caution for future versions.
