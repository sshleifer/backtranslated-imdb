I'm a big fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a rather disappointing experience. Ambient background music? What really sets the mood of the movie? I lack almost all the qualities I have associated with Lynch's work. The visuals are dull, to say the least, and the dialogue is vague and monotonous to be of any interest. <br /> <br /> This looks more like a film than students awkwardly try to make a film about artistic dogmas than the work of an experienced director. I have seen many amateur movies with much better camera work, scenery, sound and screenplay. This film does not have almost all the artistic qualities. I feel like I'm watching one of Davids's homemade videos, produced during a weekend trip with some friends.
