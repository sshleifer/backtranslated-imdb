This is the worst documentary ever to come out of Canada !!!! Glad to see the guys did not make another movie. All they want to do is make a movie and it does not have to be what they wrote. They continue to change the script according to the person they are promoting. I could not get out of the theater fast enough when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival that year. Please never see this movie.
