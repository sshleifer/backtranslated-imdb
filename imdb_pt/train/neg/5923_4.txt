During the Civil War, there were many cases of divided loyalties; obviously, many occurred "In the Border States," where the North encountered the South by chance of geography. From the border, the young father Owen Moore leaves to join the Army of the Union. Shortly after, the confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated of its regime, wanders by the property of the enemy, despaired by water; he finds a supply where the young daughter of trade unionist Gladys Egan sits down. When the Yankee soldiers locate him, Little Gladys innocently helps the Confederate to hide. Later, when he returns to kill his father, the goodness of the girl is remembered. A Sweet and Little Story by Director D.W. Griffith Local footage and humanity are exhibited with love. In the Border States (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
