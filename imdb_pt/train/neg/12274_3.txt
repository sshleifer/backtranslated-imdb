I usually am not to say that a movie is not worth watching, but this is certainly a strenuous circumstance. The only real advantage to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking quite attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is incredibly annoying and practically does not get anywhere along the film. Neither character is even remotely interesting and there is no reason to worry about anyone. I'm not sure why the hell Sean Connery agreed to make this movie, but he definitely should have gone through that one. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see by watching this movie is if you are a die. -Easy Sean Connery fan and simply wants to see everything he's done. Save this for the last one though. <br /> <br /> Well, if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my comment (or any of the other comments on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
