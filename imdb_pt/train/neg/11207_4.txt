As an avid fan of George McDonald Fraser's Flashman books, I yearned immensely to see Flashy on the big screen when this movie first came out. Unfortunately it was a big disappointment then - so I left alone for 20 years before returning to watch it again, but it was not better the second time around. Mr. Fraser is a tremendously skilled writer, but I'm not a fan of his screenplay with Richard Lester. The penchant for spoiling has spoiled 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same applies here. For me, the whole tone and feel of the movie is wrong. Flashman's books are incredibly funny in some parts, but they are adventure novels. There is a lot of seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is broadcast in the novels, but not broadcast in all the films due to his comic style. It's a tremendous shame, because it could have a great movie if it had been a more faithful adaptation to the style of the book. When I read the book for the first time, the article said that the movie would be starring Oliver Reed. I rejoiced, for Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman. How I would have loved to see it on paper. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books (very skinny looking! Flashman must be a great colleague). Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the movie is that it is made like a comedy. The only scene in which he creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills Gautet (Tom Bell). A great shame, since the values ​​of production, costumes, scenarios, etc. are excellent and the cast is generally excellent - almost everyone in the film is well separated from Malcolm McDowell. Possibly the direction of Richard Lester was responsible for how the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of 'Flash For Freedom', adapted by Mr Fraser, worked very well. Maybe one day we can see Flashman doing justice on screen.
