Georgia Rule has to be one of the - if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me sigh, "what?" loudly, at least 7-10 times throughout your grueling two-hour course. <br /> <br /> Announced in her trailer as a film about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter and Lindsay Lohan as the rebellious granddaughter, over-sexed, scantily clad, the viewer thinks that this will be a clich√©, light, chick-flick about growing up and uniting as a family. <br /> <br /> Talk about false advertising at worst. <br /> <br /> After many animal shots doing "funny" things in the background of "essential" scenes and not mentioning the whole five minutes focused on an old woman who goes into a doctor's office weekly to get her diaper changed, or the fact that this film is about the character of Lindsay Lohan being sexually abused by her stepfather, Georgia Rule creates her own genre of cinema: Inappropriate comedy, terribly represented, dealing with extremely serious problems in the strangest, surreal and strange way . If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy, then he should have watched The Royal Tenenbaums. Laterally. Junebug. And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel about making a reader understand the horrible genre on which the Georgia Rule fits is to create a hypothetical situation. Let's say the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of the film taking a more dramatic turn, it laughs and comedy, with all the reactions of the characters being of false and lifeless humans, pretending to care. <br /> <br /> Add a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest and non-dimensional character that could have been cut completely from this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all his religions. beliefs and morals to be with an unprotected, tanned girl who does not share the same interests as him as well as an unnecessary car chase scene, unreal moments of characters trying to relate, and you have the Georgia Rule. <br /> <br /> I found this movie an insult to any of the people who are struggling with filmmakers, writers, actors, editors, etc. who are much more talented and are not succeeding. noticed. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you need to, get drunk enough before hand.
