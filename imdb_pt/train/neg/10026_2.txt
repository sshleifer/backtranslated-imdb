I had some expectation for the film, since it had a great cast of stars and is the return of the pair of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story of the Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits in the beginning, I felt good because it was done in a cool way. Well, the first scene itself surprised me. So the main disadvantage of the movie are the action sequences. Me and my friends were laughing at our guts watching these fucking fights. It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all thugs got to have machine guns! Phew ... you have to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> The other thing about the movie is the very predictable story. It reminded me of some movies from the early 1980s. Well, the only thing the movie is worth is the sexy Kareena, who looked really hot on this one. And so I give a 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please ... please ... I do not see this thinking that it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this for some laughter in the terrible fight scenes. <br /> <br /> That's all.
