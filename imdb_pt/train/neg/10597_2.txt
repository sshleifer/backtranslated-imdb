This movie was absolutely horrible. I can not think of a good thing about it. The holes in the plot were so big you could drive a Hummer through them. The acting was so stupidly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that's saying a lot !!! And dialogue, what dialogue? To think I was a fan of the first (I use this comment vaguely, it's more like guilty pleasure, than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it to scream out loud !!!! Nothing good can come from this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad you can not even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of !!! This has to be in my top five films of all time. 2/10 because it 's so difficult for me to give a 1.
