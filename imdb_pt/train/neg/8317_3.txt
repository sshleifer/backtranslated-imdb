For a movie about a killer, this is surprisingly annoying. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens much and even when things happen, they do not generate any real excitement or interest. <br /> <br /> Performance is good on both tracks, Cassetti in particular, delivers great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of Succo, but the rest of the cast also does what they need. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is bad writing and direction and the fact that as a true story is not interesting, Succo is not a unique character, it is not interesting or exciting. Films of this type usually try to generate tension or empathy or indignation and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you have wasted your time watching.
