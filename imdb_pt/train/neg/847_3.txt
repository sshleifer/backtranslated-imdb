The film is about two brothers who should be the same - but they are by no means expected to be smart - one is a surgeon and the other is able to write a computer code. Geniuses like they like to call themselves that sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to the personal characteristics you can perceive from the title material. <br /> <br /> I honestly did not like the style of the movie. I think the anxiety, confusion, and deep blues she brings are there for a purpose, but what I do not understand is why there is so much of it. The film is cheap in scenes and tells the story basically without any human aspect. It gives comics as experience. However, it is visually numbing the viewer, somehow brings it into the blues with brief dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic cuts, music and abrupt noises. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is very simple, most of what is happening is being dramatically portrayed for long minutes, especially in confusing delusions, simulating drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I will openly say that this movie did not live up to my expectations a little bit.
