<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech), who has a crush on her. Now she is preparing for her prom with her stupid and annoying friends. Once there, they begin to die one by one because the killer has escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her ball is too important to be interrupted. <br /> <br /> Professionals: I got some good laugh out of the film due to the terrible dialogue and the character's idiotic movement. <br /> <br /> An example: Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is strangely obsessed with her (she does not look so good) has escaped from prison. Their motive: they do not want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Cons: Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of slasher. Usually I can have fun with the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is an idiotic slasher movie that is rated PG-13 has nothing to do with me not liking the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like horror movies that do not even have stories. At least they can be fun. This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills his whole family. A few years later, he tries to make peace with her by ruining his ball and killing all his friends ...? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps and I could not care less. This should have been a feature of life, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And so ... this is a horror movie with terrible death scenes. I do not even care that it's not so bloody, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not so bloody, but they still had effective killings. Here we have half of the characters dying in the same hotel room off-screen, a woman being stabbed several times without stabbing and a close-up on the face of a bad actor as he screams in agony. I'm sure 10-year-old girls were terrified, but I was not. <br /> <br /> I also hated the characters. There was Donna's unrealistic boyfriend, Bobby (Scott Porter), and I can almost guarantee you'll never meet such a sensitive boyfriend in your life, unless you're a gay man. Then we had the annoying friends of Donna, Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the symbolic evil girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying, try watching this movie. And do not get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks of Usher's performance on SHE'S ALL THAT. <br /> <br /> Add to everything the predictable plot turns, a terrible soundtrack and a great lack of respect for the original material, and you have quite stinky.
