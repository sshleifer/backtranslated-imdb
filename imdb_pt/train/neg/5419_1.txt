Why do filmmakers always go against the work of the author? I mean, yes, things have to be condensed to the interest of the viewer, but look at Anne of Green Gables. They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delicious. I can not believe they chose to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea in such a terrible mess. Look at all that they missed while doing this. . . Paul Irving, Little Elizabeth, Widows, Windy Poplars. . . and Anne's college years, for the love of God !!! Would not it be wonderful to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things one film at a time, instead of mixing them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. This movie was good if you let the novels out of it !! But the beautiful work of L.M. Montgomery is something that should not be denied. This film was a disappointment after seeing the successful way he gave Anne of Green Gables to life.
