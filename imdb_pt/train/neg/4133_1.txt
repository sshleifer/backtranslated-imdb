I watched this movie with some friends a few months ago, I still laugh today thinking about some absolute stupidity. The first scenes alone were hilarious. I will not ruin anything for those who wish to see this, I would not want to ruin the laughter. Needless to say, the whole time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing. In the end, we all get bored, however, as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random has worn itself off. There is no plot and no decent acting outline. The characters are as well developed as those of a kindergarten "Learn to Read" book. They even managed to make an uninteresting lesbian sex scene.
