Coyote Ugly could have been far more effective if the filmmakers had made him a film of guilty pleasure / exploitation (with much nudity). But since the PG-13 rating is what all studios are wanting these days, we end up with a movie like this: a PG-13 "provocative" movie that is not allowed to go as far as the film should have gone <br /> <br /> The script is generic that is It is easy to guess which point of the plot will occur 15 minutes before it actually happens. The acting is adequate, but the characters are so fine that nothing could be done with them. There were also many points where it felt like I was watching a video clip instead of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only features of the movie are the incredibly beautiful female leads. We got to see them in some extremely tight and quite revealing costumes ..... but only a lot could be shown due to the PG-13 restrictions. There are plenty of cleavage and toning, agitated bodies doing some pretty choreographed dance numbers, but there is no nudity or sex to speak of. Tyra Banks (she keeps getting even more insanely beautiful with age) is also in the movie for a very small period of time. Newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on her eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows a genuine acting potential. <br /> <br /> The only people I could see this movie appealing to is prepubescent boys who are not allowed to watch movies with R censorship yet. This audience can take full advantage of this, but adult audiences will feel angry and deceived. Rating: the movie-1 the women-10
