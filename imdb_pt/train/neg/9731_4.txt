Others have commented on the "decline" of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of selecting good projects (as he proved to star in the same year "Exorcist III"), so why did he agree to appear in it? Of course, he makes a suitably demented presentation, and the film is not totally bad; it's just not engaging, uninteresting and unpleasant. There are three "no" ones. (* 1/2)
