I watched the DVD (called Black Widow in the US) and felt after that it was, in fact, a really horrible movie. But they must have cut the original movie a little, or I've lost a lot. The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a breast), but I read several other comments on the board mentioning the vulgarity and something about an inner absorbent. I have not seen anything like it, just a bad, boring movie with unpleasant characters and a banal and noble plot. Giada Colagrande is paralyzed from the mouth up or from Botox to the gills, and even an expression touches her face. And her name makes me think of a super-sizing of a drink at Taco Bell: "I'm Gonna Eat the Big Tail!" In fact, it was so much fun to have been so bad, I started playing it like I was in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000, noticing things like the fact that Dafoe's skin is too big for his face. It really is like dumb dough!
