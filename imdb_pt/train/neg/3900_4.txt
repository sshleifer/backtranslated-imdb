As one who read the book, I can say that this is far inferior to the great American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, Emma is very unpleasant. Yes, she has flaws and is not the easiest person to like - but the viewer should not start to despise her. Secondly, Mr. Knightly is miscast. His melancholy and melancholy version in this version is more suitable for a Bronte or Gaskell adaptation than Austen, and plays the mood anyway "out". Third, Samantha Morton is a very strong actress to be relegated to the role of Harriet; and why was she made to look so sick? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and flowery - it does not look like she'll be taken off by the next scene. Fourth, the structure was destroyed and cut scenes. In the end, when Emma decides she loves Mr. Knightly, this seems very disconcerting because this narrative was not adequately shown and conveyed throughout the film. Fifth, what exactly was going on with Mrs. Elton? She stopped sounding like an American actress trying to stifle her own accent at first, for the whole American world and then for English at the end. Finally, it dragged on at the end. The book and the version of the great film ends with the marriage of Emma and Knightly. This version creeps confusingly after the wedding announcement without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very casual attempt. Read the book or rent the Paltrow version
