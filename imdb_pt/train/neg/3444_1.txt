This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. From the plot, although the shots, the "special effects", the acting, and I mentioned the plot? Each of these things sucks! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "excess" means and will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do; this should be one of those movies that you can not really tell what's going on until the end. You get hypnotized, not knowing who is dead and who is alive and who killed who and why and when you think you have the right timeline, find out you are wrong and the movie ends - leaving you with your mouth open for the next 5 minutes! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job", if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the writer of this garbage, yes, Olga ?? The writer, director, producer, screenwriter, caster, production designer, art director, costume designer and also duo of one of the characters is some scenes ... it's basically a movie of a woman and when it comes to Olga Levens, Levens Productions "you can not go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well, that may come as a shock, but" this time "Olga ended up making that big moment, jumping from scene to scene, from dreams to reality ... but wait! This was all a dream after all ... or was it ??? The image fades and I realize that none of this happened, the girl was alone on the ship ... in fact there was no ship ... without waiting! There is the ship again and the guys! They are alive! Thank God! No, they're calling her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears, so maybe they're dead anyway ??? or maybe they were never alive to begin ??? <br /> <br /> If you understand what I just said, you may like this movie - otherwise it's a tedious job and the only reason I run into all this crap is figuring out how the hell they can finish this movie ... <br /> <br /> Do not watch this if you value time, and 90 minutes is a waste in this case ...
