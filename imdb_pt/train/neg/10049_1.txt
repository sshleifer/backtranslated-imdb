I love the "Masters of Horror" series, often poorly finished. Terror fans live in constant lack of nutrition. Projects like this (and the similar "Greenlight Project" with "Feast" - as he or he added it) are breeding grounds for wonderful bubbles of thought in the minds of directors with a horror inclined to develop and bring maturing of food to us I love eating horror. <br /> <br /> This started with a really-kool-idea kernel and ran ... straight from the edge of "where in the world am I going with this? !!!". <br /> <br /> I do not know how to spoil the pampered, but "SPOILER AHEAD" Suddenly ... no, there was that light floating in the night sky earlier ... we have a lot of luminescent hair aliens (huh? ... HUH?) Brain-piercing males and ... yes, I understand, but ... well ... the worst damn storytelling - an exciting and promising setup without a rewarding outcome. Quote for storytellers ... their buildup has to have a reward that exceeds the buildup. Not the other way around. Storytelling 101. End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
