First of all, I would like to point out that although I am not an expert, how the trial was treated will insult your intelligence. First, the prosecution has never proved that "facilitated learning" really works. Irresponsible both by the prosecution (because they can get a recourse) and by the defense by not acting on it. As another commentator said, facilitated learning turned out to be false. Second, they used Terry as the translator who has a personal interest, and even testify, in the judgment that is simply stupid. If the court allowed him to testify in this way, they would have brought someone neutral, otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal. Third, this child has never been asked specific questions about the accused by the prosecution (birthmarks, event details, etc.) and even when asked for specific defense issues such as when he started, he was unable to respond. If that is not a reasonable doubt, I do not know what it is and a competent lawyer would have obtained an acquittal. <br /> <br /> In short, it starts well with the pressures of parenting a child with autism, but judgment makes this movie totally unbelievable.
