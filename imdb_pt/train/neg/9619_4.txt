If you can believe, * another * group of teenagers back to * another * cottage by the lake three years later * another * one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of them. Down and behold a psychopath wearing a standardized hockey mask (a cheap paper guy) turns to waste them one by one. This "Friday 13th" mechanic has gained little acclaim as one of the earliest features of digital outlets, but that's where the cool facts end and all that remains is an amateur and predictable production with below-average performances and a boom microphone recurrent. intrusion. A twist in the last second does little to raise the spirits, and 'Memorial Day' is something better thrown into a lake and forgotten. One for insane slasher collectors only.
