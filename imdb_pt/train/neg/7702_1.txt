I am a black man living in a predominantly black city. That said, I have some questions about the work of Tyler Perry. I realize that some people out there feel the need to compliment him because he is black and tries to portray a positive image about culture. But, I honestly believe that if Perry White, this movie had the NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all over your butt. <br /> <br /> I've been forced to watch this movie a whole hell of a lot lately and every repeated remark makes my blood boil. The characters are poorly written and acted. The jokes are so bad, I have to really say that something is funny. I'm just gonna break that big pile of sh-t down. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character may have had some appeal, but there is no more. When the only thing she seems to do is hit kids and threaten adults with violence, she's less than useless. It is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The situation with the wife beating the groom was horrible. If a woman was so frightened by her husband's death, why would she try to escape when he was asleep in bed. It would not have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work. Anyway, the characters in this bow were so irritating and arrogant that I expected him to throw it off the balcony and be highlighted when he did not. <br /> <br /> Then there are the two lovebirds. A bus driver asks a woman out for harassing her while he is making his rounds. I could not believe it. I really could not believe when she agreed to go out with him even more. But what drives the cake is that an adult man was reduced to throwing pebbles in a window and passing notes like a ten-year-old by a mega-castrating bitch. I do not use this term lightly, but this woman only had two modes. Morose victim and psycho momma. No matter which of these two faces she showed, however, there was a constant. The bus driver was not going to get any. He even married her without trying the goods - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then there is the scene of the family reunion. Here we have the mother load, which includes implicit incestuous taboos, grinding to grind, shirtless, with excess muscles, b-ball, plus the great taste of Maya Angelou. When those boys dragged their asses out and called a meeting, I was wrong to wish the eldest of them would be claimed for a heart attack. All this crap is happening at the meeting, in laughably easy to separate groups, and then they ring a bell. When they do, everyone drops what they are doing and moves on to a conversation as well, like a pack of Pavlov's puppies - WTF !! <br /> <br /> So you have the final five minutes of the movie. In it, we see the abusive boyfriend being mistreated by his longtime victim and all the bad part of the actress. There is an impromptu wedding where the blacks are dressed like angels and hang from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to watch it so far, besides testing your threshold for pain, is the hope that the second villain in this story has his butt delivered to her as well. Guess, that does not happen. Instead, Perry takes the testically challenged exit and plays it safe, ending the movie in a tone of forgiveness - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm sure that if given one day, I could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks. Do not even get me started on the rest of Tyler Perry's movies. I'll just say that. In my opinion, as a black guy, D.W. Griffith's legacy is still alive. The irony is that this is done through a black man who will be praised for doing what Birth of a Nation did, selling us down the river. I just wanted Perry's movies to be expensive so I could kick them in the nuts. Many thanks, man !! What are you going to follow in 2009, a comedy about rape and the violent aggression of slaves in Colonial America?
