hg is usually exploitative, and never bothered me before - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudo sciences or heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electric accident and a witch. I do not object to witches, and I liked "carrie" (the novel and the movie), but this bothered me. I think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line. also the university professor wasting time studying esp cases. I was not alive in the 1960s to know firsthand if esp was a common fallacy at the time, but I suppose any such theory would simply be discredited. what really bothered me was the way the police described schizophrenics as ruthless and unpredictable villains who can look like normal people in 99 percent of the time and then just fit in. Nothing could be further from the truth. I hate these concepts because they increase public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some decent concepts for the film. I liked the way the witch wore men; It was a good change. I liked how she could become attractive, but not when she was around her forced lovers. I found it interesting how his second lover also burned his face. if the script had been retouched for a few weeks before production and did not just focus on making its audience dumber, it may have been a decent movie.
