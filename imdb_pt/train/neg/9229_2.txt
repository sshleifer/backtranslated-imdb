This is a movie about making a movie. Such movies can be fun, but they need some substance for that. It did not happen here, I'm afraid. Mr. Coppola has not inherited his father's abilities, unfortunately (or his sister, who can, however, make movies that anyone can watch). <br /> <br /> I wonder how this movie came to receive great criticism. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the lead actor, supposedly a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same tone he says, the main actress has an expression on his face that never changes, the plot is fully segmented into bits with perhaps a single connecting element, the movie within the idea of ​​the film must be more obsolete than Paleolithic rocks ... Would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I regret every moment I watched this movie. A ride with the dog is far superior entertainment to this incredibly lame movie. It's as if a plot by François Truffaut was directed by Dick Cheney ... Brazil, some other classic science fiction films? You must be really kidding ...
