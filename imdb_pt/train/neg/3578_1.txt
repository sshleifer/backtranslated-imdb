There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie. They took a despicable history, confused it, wrote it wrongly, mistreated it. He has a badly misunderstood dialogue in a winding and useless story. <br /> <br /> As evil as it fails as art, it fails even more as trade. Who could have been the target market for this. Which age group? Which interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. That I would pay to see. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and it ranks with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Hands" ... my choices as the three most hopelessly bad movies I've ever seen. Everyone associated with it must be forced to talk to VanDamme for all eternity. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this movie and take an academic exercise - how could you do it and get worse? I can not think of a way.
