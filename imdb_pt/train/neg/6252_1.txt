Ronald Reagan and a bunch of American soldiers at a North Korean prisoner of war camp. They are tortured ... We learned the North Korean communists are bad people ... We learned that American beards grow very slowly during days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress it, but I finally burst out laughing at this movie. It was the scene in which Reagan leaves telling the Communists that he wants to be on their side. Then he asks for a bottle of brandy. Then, acting sober, he takes a drunken companion, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to cure Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean Communist Guard is as dumb as it comes. Then the drunk distracts the guard as Reagan approaches to get something out of a drawer, which sits next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure the boxes should contain something; but, of course, Reagan makes them shudder enough to reveal they are empty. You have to laugh! I think "Prisoner of War" will appeal primarily to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise it is a waste. Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
