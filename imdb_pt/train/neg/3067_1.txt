That's just bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they deviate from the original, are good on their own. They can bring another point of view and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and pleasing. This was as badly thought out and accomplished as possible. This was not good even standing on its own. Viggo Mortenson is a top-notch actor, but some of his selections of roles and projects are in short supply. The original "Vanishing Point" was such an exciting psychological adventure; this is not an adventure, and it is neither enjoyable nor amusing. This was done from a numbers-by-number approach to movie making, filling in plot points that someone in Hollywood believes will please what they see as today's movie audience. Basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It is insulting that someone puts it as a feature film, and even tries to redo a cult classic so carelessly. The manipulative devices of the plot, the "make-it-obvious-for-not-miss-point" aspects, ridiculous dialogue, stereotyped characters, amateur direction ... simple evil ....
