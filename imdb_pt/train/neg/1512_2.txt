A malicious steal attempt of "Seven", complete with sub-second-degree acting, terrible camera work, half-cooked story and strong residual taste of lame propaganda. Yes, they "sex offenders", they live in the house next door and you will be raped, actually. <br /> <br /> No surprises from the vice-terminator woman, she acts as always - as convincingly as a play. wooden. Richard Gere continues to slide more and more - and is as low as the late Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> The singer woman with the crazy eyes is better when she is dead in bed; and even the wolf was below average (although she was the best performer in the movie) - maybe they fed her before the shots, or something. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Seven," which had a (made but interesting) story, to which one could relate more or less, regardless of country, this movie seems to focus on a US obsession only. If one does not care much about "sex offenders" - and the statistics are that lack of exercise and poor diet cause more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to see or be afraid. There are some body part fetishes and some snuff, but the blood is less than mediocre, and it fails as much as an artistic device (because it is useless) as blood because it is not bloody enough. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this.
