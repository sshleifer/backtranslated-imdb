I am a Christian. I've always been skeptical about movies made by Christians, though. As a rule, they are "ignorant" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a horrible job. The acting was horrible, and unless someone is familiar with the Bible in any way, no one COULD have understood what the movie was trying to convey. Not only was the film terribly made, but the people who did it still had some wrong facts. However, in this "critique," these facts are irrelevant and too deep to delve into. In short, the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone except for the comic relief from the daily grind.
