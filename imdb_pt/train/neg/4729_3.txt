LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis' weirdest movies. Part pastelade, part fluff, part surreal and strange part. Elvis meets a very grumpy girl with an annoying voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story does not make much sense, as is the case with most Elvis Presley films, and there are a lot of strange characters in abundance. There is not much music in this, but what I enjoyed, though none is memorable. Strange continuity Elvis and Michelle Carey enter her beach house at night, but a few minutes later a delivery man walks in and it's blaring daylight !! What?? This is about the essence of the movie. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) the dog steals the show.
