There seem to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star ratings here from people who have never written a review of IMDb before or after. Given the very low average rating given to the movie by other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I admit, I thought the concept was kind of cute, and I was glad to see the actresses playing Eve and Harmony at Angel beginning work, but it did not take long for the horror of that movie to come true. known. <br /> <br /> Performance: Did the leaders seem competent enough, but all the others? Terrible. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck. <br /> <br /> Direction: nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Mood: Do they really think people would laugh? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Okay. there were some very beautiful women in this movie. Not just the three main female characters, but on the other side of the board. It was as if the producers expected the scene to leave the male viewers so distracted that they did not notice how terrible everything was. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hands, this could have been funny, but somberly funny classic camp. It was not even close.
