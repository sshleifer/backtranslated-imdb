Okay, if you have a few hours to lose, or if you really hate your life, I'd say watch this movie. If anything is good for some laughs. Not only do you have obese natives, topless but also special effects so bad that they are probably banned in most states. Seriuosly, the 'PG' rating is humorous too, once you see the Native Porn Extravaganza. I would not give this movie to my retarded nephew. You can not even show it to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is incomplete and clich√©, and stupid and stupid. The acting is horrible, and the ending is so painful to watch that I actually started pouring salt into my eyes just to get my mind off the idiocy that fills my TV screen.
