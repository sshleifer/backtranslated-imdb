Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse to squander movies that should be recycled as toilet paper has recently destroyed my confidence in the art of cinema. First of all, it was done. Second, people went to see him. Third, some people have voted for him as the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100% sure it would be 1 billion times better. Most bad movies have their moments, (even Godzilla had some cool special effects) the moment of this movie was when I left the theater nauseous. The only thing that could have made the movie worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to look like crap for an hour and a half, I'll throw a trash can in a can. If anyone does not totally despise this film, I pity you, your children, and your children's children; however, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I clearly do not tolerate children having sex.
