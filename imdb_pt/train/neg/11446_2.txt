My family and I filtered Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog is (my four-year-old son loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar material. The only thing that could have saved this film was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg's face for making this movie. I admit, though, that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure if the movie was set in the 80's, but with most of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I'd make a pass. And stay home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station. Or if you are determined to watch this, people under the influence can have fun.
