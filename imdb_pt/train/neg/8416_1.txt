It makes sense to me that this movie is being praised by Hollywood because often in Hollywood it's all just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the movie may be reacting to the countless songs being spat upon you rather than story content. However, this film is overrated and exaggerated. Eddie Murphy sounds ridiculous. No way Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonc√© Knowles gave the best performing Oscar that many praised before the movie came out. I can not even believe that Condon is being prepared to be nominated for an Oscar when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace a plot at all. A lot of songs do not make a movie.
