.. Oh wait, I can! This film is not for the typical snob movie, unless you want to revise your typical cinematic settings, such as "continuity edit" and "geographic match." I did not know where I was in this movie. A second they are in the present, the next minute, supposedly in the 70s, driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like a 1980s style outfit. I think. I could not pay enough attention to this, since the acting was horrible. I think I only have attention because it has a 3d that I did not watch. If you're a movie buff B, and B movie, I mean BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's a home movie and any nonsense style will make you laugh as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni, skip this one.
