The idea is cool. Bringing so many stars into a movie is great. But ... lots of stories, very short and meaningless. No connection between scenes. There were about 3-4 brilliant stories ... but these were 18. The painting reminded me of "All Invisible Children" - a film that I really enjoyed. Compared to this, however, "Paris Je T'Aime" does not have the intriguing tale, which develops - begins and has its end. And miss the topic by connecting all those children. I do not think Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short designs together. Perhaps for people who know Paris is interesting. Otherwise I would not recommend ...
