This crap, since I can not call it film, can be summarized by the following. <br /> <br /> The stereotypical black criminal with the black dwarf partner got into trouble. -Black Midget pretends to be a baby. with a fully developed adult face, body hair and genitalia - The black dwarf is deceived (in some way) by men and women who happen to want a baby - black dwarf who commits acts of physical and sexual violence, lower white people wherever which he honestly sees, could have been a good satire if it had not been directed so superficially and had starless bastards starring.
