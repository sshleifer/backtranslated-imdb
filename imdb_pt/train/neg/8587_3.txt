This kind of narrative is unacceptable. The only reason this movie is anywhere above the 5 stars out of the 10 lines is because it has George Lucas behind it, and has the words "Star" and "Wars" in its title. This is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing and acting but have not received credit. This is a fake. <br /> <br /> First things first. The story. Evolution of Anakin? There is none. In addition to a little makeup around the eyes and a little screaming, there are none. He becomes young, stupid and arrogant Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader in a single blow. The only thing consistent about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, whatever you wanted. The only consistent thing about Anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is its consistent stupidity. He even loses his body because of stupid arrogance. <br /> <br /> What part of the Emperor Palpatine telling you the legends of the Sith does not point to the Emperor being a Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> The fight scenes used many digital doubles. Everyone is flying all over like teddy bears in a makeshift dollhouse. Count Dookan, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost all the fighters had a double digital jumping rubber. In a specific fighting scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climactic battle, both really stop in the middle of parries and ripos, to spin their sabers a few times with inches away. I realize that the fights are choreographed, but this only made me shake my head in disbelief and disgust. <br /> <br /> The writing was horrible. The whole dialogue was tremendously low quality. Good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their lines, but that was not enough. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. Too many special effects, conspires holes larger than the center of the universe and absolutely no perception of any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this movie: nothing new is offered. We know that the approximate image of everything, all that Lucas did was color it. <br /> <br /> We knew that Anakin lost his limbs. We knew Luke and Leia were brother and sister, we knew Luke was Anakin's son, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda would go into exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this movie. If that's all the fans wanted, fine, Lucas could not have been wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader, and he asks for Padme, and hears that she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and shouts "Nooooooooooooooooooooo". That scene screamed B-movie all the way, and I was hoping that Darth Vader would be "DANGER ROBINSON, DANGER" anytime. That's what this is. A B movie, disguised by a huge budget and an ultra-loyal fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two films have lowered their standards to Earth's holes.
