When I bought this DVD I thought: "It seems to be a light comedy about love and relationships made in Portuguese standards? Let's give it a chance ??" I was TOTALLY WRONG! What a disappointing movie! First, it is not a comedy; is a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it is even worse than many Portuguese novels! Secondly, the plot is so annoying and gets you nowhere? It has no structure, just flows, like the wind, in one direction or another ?? Production is also bad! The sound mix is ​​awful, because sometimes the voices are disconnected. Did this remind me of some old Portuguese films from the 80's ?? Should the acting have been better too? Well, to summarize, it is not with movies like this that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese films I've seen in years! Bad argument, bad acting, poor production? I did not have high hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than I imagined! Just forget!
