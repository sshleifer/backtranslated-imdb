This film refers to supposed types of non-establishment (aesthetic and sexual) that apparently do not withstand the basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players participate, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are based on a childish script that depends almost entirely on a smart dialogue; what is not. Nixon's role has the best lines, but often it fits into them very quickly, a time flaw that must be attributed to the director. The grotesque climax uses every available clich√©, spent or not, and properly completes this monotonous comedy attempt.
