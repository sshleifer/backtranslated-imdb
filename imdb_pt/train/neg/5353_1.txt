I had the "privilege" of attending a special "Absence of Light" exhibit at a horror convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First, you know you're in trouble when the director presents a movie, saying, "Now, keep in mind that we did not have a lot of money ..." Not that movies without a budget are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse, the results are always bad. And there is no better example than this festival of incontestable sleep. <br /> <br /> In fact, 'Absence of Light' marks the first time in the world of underground cinema: it is the only time I have seen a cast of dreams of talented veterans annoying me. Charismatic actors like David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister enter and leave the movie at random and prove to be as unattractive as non-amateurs. Who are your characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's all so monotonous that it will stop caring about anything or anyone. After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. Not surprisingly, most of the cast members attended. <br /> <br /> Any curious fan of genre would do well to stay away from it. With any luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
