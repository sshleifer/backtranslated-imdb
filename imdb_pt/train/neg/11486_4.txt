Because some people, like me, like to know EVERYTHING about a movie, even if they plan to see it, including the ending. Anyway, here's the end, as I remember, because I could not have been more than 8 years old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV. But I'll tell you, it sure scared the little child I was and thought about it days later, and that still stands out in my mind even today, although some details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember this! I did not even remember that old Barnabus was in that movie, and I LOVED Dark Shadows. So in the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is attracted to the Judge (Joseph Cotton, I suppose, although I remember him as being an old family doctor or something rather than a judge; see how the memory disappears?) to the wedding venue, which, as I recall, is in some kind of cave? Maybe I misunderstood; and Shelley Winters is there laughing, and the judge has a cape, and the camera angle is kind of looking at him, and he throws back the cloak, and he has goat legs, and he announces that he's really his father , the devil. , and she played right into their hands, because the "mortal" guy she fell in love with (I think is Robert Foxworth) ends up being the guy Satan wants to marry her to, The Demon with Yellow Eyes, and yes, for sure, they show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes shine in yellow. There are lots of close-ups in the last minutes of the movie. Everyone is laughing and rejoicing, except for Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and she cries or screams or something, and that's the end. The bandits win.
