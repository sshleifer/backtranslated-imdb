A group of models look for an apartment to live in and is shown by a local real estate agent. Unknown to the models and the agent, however, is that "the threshold of hell" is in the apartment and when crossed, the demon "Dethman" is summoned to kill all those in his path. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist who has been charged with the murders. <br /> <br /> Although I am a champion of low budget, microbudget and independent films, I can not praise this movie. The creators are proud of their 24-hour shooting schedule and at least one actor takes pride in the DVD of their acting prowess, but I can not figure it out. Why make a movie in 24 hours if an extra hour or two of editing makes all the difference? And why be proud of acting poorly, meaningless and that results in the poor delivery of a handful of lines? <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, the models are being shown in parts of an apartment by a real estate industry. agent. The dialogue is clearly improvised because no screenwriter could invent such empty diction. The agent, too, clearly knows nothing about dwelling ... she focuses on aspects of a house that no one could care about, explains the heat source incorrectly (did she not see the radiator?) And says that the worms problem will be solved when they call it "the terminator." Please write a script - some detour is fine, but that was a mess. <br /> <br /> And why were the girls moving into role models? Their careers had no meaning in the plot, and this seems a forced situation. At one point, an actress breaks the character and says something in the effect of "dude, they'll get (annoyed)", which sounds more natural than any other line, though out of place because of the other bad dialogue. /> <br /> The demon did not make sense. I appreciated trying to explain how "the threshold of hell" jumps to random places on Earth (including apartment fireplaces), but why not explain where the devil came from? His training involves a man whose love is killed by another man. How does that make you a demon? (Also, why do we need all these Victorian flashbacks without dialogue and looks through a field?) It was an exaggeration.) The dramatic pauses between the queues were terrible. The character Sam Bishop was by far the worst, with the interviewer not far behind. Every question requires a pause, a funny face and an answer ... followed by a pause, a funny face and an answer? I was so frustrated. For me, the only point was to drag the time out ... but I'd rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than a horrible delivery hour (and then more time is wasted rolling the same credits twice). /> <br /> Who was Sam Bishop's character, anyway? Allegedly, he "saw" all of this and was accused of killing the girls, but still, at no point did he go down in history with the girls. So how did he see them? And if he did not know, how did he know Dethman killed them? And if he has not seen Dethman, how does he know that Dethman is the spirit of the Apostles? I was so lost ... was there even a sketch for a plot when it was written? <br /> <br /> The only part that I found nice in this movie was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. Not that this was really important or anything, but it was the only break from the boredom I was given. I wonder what director Felix Diaz was thinking. His music is very good (see the backstage DVD for his improvisation), but I wonder about his filmmaking skills. Although by far the best part of the DVD was the trailer for his "Superhero Excelsior" (the trailer alone was better than all this loss of time). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to have to be so hard. I would like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea has never been to make a quality movie. But if "Superhero Excelsior" is any indication, Diaz can do quality ... so why did he choose to avoid it here? Maybe the world will never know.
