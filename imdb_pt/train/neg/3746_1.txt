As difficult as I may believe, with all the terrible events of reality in recent years, this has to take the first place for the worst yet. I'm still wondering if this was actually just a spoof made by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I would be sure he was behind it. Can a rock band lower themselves than INXS to do something as shameful as that? The premise is simple and stupid. Audition a lot of karaoke rejects to become the new lead singer of INXS, to take the place of Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years later, with no successes, the band commits the last act of patronage by auditioning a bunch of aspiring talents to be the new lead singer of a band that has already spent 20 years of its heyday. So they trot all those terrible singers (I think American Idol had their share of doozies) that make atrocious interpretations of virtually every classic (and predictable) rock imaginable. And then they cut to INXS members who are seriously discussing the merits of each of these candidates. You could see better (and more original) rock artists in just about any nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has all the uncreative elements of all other reality shows. Lame participants reality, lame interviews, host lame / emcee, lame "judging" performances and the lame initiation of a participant at the end of each show. Can these shows be more predictable? It's clearly a publicity stunt on the part of the band; a last sigh of hope in rekindling their lost stardom before they were finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if you have any trace of dignity when you're alive, you have to be rolling in your grave. Not that INXS was a great band, but I had no idea they were so pathetic. If INXS is representative of what rock and roll has become, this show would be the ultimate proof that rock and roll is dead once and for all.
