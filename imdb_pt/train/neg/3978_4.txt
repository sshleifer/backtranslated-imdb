When In Rome is a definite improvement on Getting There. Arriving there, I found it very predictable, artificial and slow, and to this day I still consider him the worst of the Olsen twins. However, while When In Rome is not a terrible movie, it's not great either. If I had to sum it up in one word, I would say passable. It's good fun for teenagers but I do not think adults will find much to continue. <br /> <br /> When In Rome has its positives. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very beautiful too. I'll admit that when I was 10, I really liked them, and in general I kind of like them still. And I enjoyed some of his films like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back on target, the two girls do not do such a bad job, in fact, they are very attractive. Also, their clothes are to die for, and the scenery of Rome is absolutely stunning. The soundtrack is not bad either. <br /> <br /> However, where the film is shot down is in the plot and script. The script is mostly cliché and has déjà vu tips. The plot, like most of Mary Kate and Ashley's films, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other Olsen twins' work will find some unoriginal elements. Most of the characters are thin cardboard and you do not learn much about them, and sometimes the rhythm is uneven. Unfortunately, the breathtaking scenery is spoiled by a rather careless camera job, which seemed to be constantly hustled. <br /> <br /> All in all, it has its positives, and certainly watchable. However, for my liking, it's harmless and predictable adolescent fluff. 4/10 Bethany Cox
