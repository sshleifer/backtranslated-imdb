I have a copy of it on VHS, I think they (the television networks) should play it every year for the next twenty years. So that we do not forget what it was and we remember not to make the same mistakes again. How to put some people in the director's chair where they do not belong. This film Rappin 'is like a Vaudevillian musical, for those who do not know how to sing or act. This movie is as fun as trying to teach the 'blind' to drive an urban bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood, (Peebles) has just gotten out of jail and is headed back to the old neighborhood. In service time for a crime of legal necessity, of course. John returns to the old street and is greeted by children, dogs, old ladies and housemates as they dance and sing all the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this if I were sentimental, or if in fact someone smoked medical marijuana prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Anyway, this is a misdirected satire, scripted and even produced (I never thought I'd sit) of the ghetto life with the 'Hood'. Although, I think the redemptive part of the story, through the gang fighting sequences and the dance numbers, your friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being demolished and cleaned. <br /> <br /> Forget Sonny's spoon, Mario could have won an Oscar for it compared to this Rap. Oh, well, if you're wanting to laugh at yourself silly and embarrassed with three quarters, do not forget to drink first. <br /> <br /> And please watch with responsibility. (No stars, better luck next time!)
