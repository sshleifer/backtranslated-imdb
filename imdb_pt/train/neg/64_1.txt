This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely awful. There was no plot for the movie. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the performance of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were great! The only problem was that the film did not do its acting as justice. If the script came close to capturing a decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, the performances of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones are completely wasted on a horrible plot ... or lack thereof. Not only was I waiting for the whole movie to make something happen to make the movie ... well, a real movie ... not just a complete dialogue between the characters for what turned out to be absolutely no motive. It was nothing more than a common dialogue that would have taken place in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only special thing was how Robert DuVall portrayed an old man drunk, senile and drunk. Nothing dignified happens throughout the movie, including the finale. When the movie ended, I was amazed ... amazed that I watched the whole movie hoping something interesting would happen to make the movie worth it. This never happened! The cast of characters suddenly began to show that the movie really ended and I realized that I had just lost 2 hours of my life watching a movie with no plot and no meaning. It was not even a story. The whole movie happens in a full day of time. That's it. It was a day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (beyond the movie Training Day)? The acting performances of the entire cast were excellent but they were grossly wasted with the disappointment of a movie ... if you can even call it movie.
