It was to be a parody of the LOTR Trilogy. But this was one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad script, all bad. THAT IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I do not doubt that there are people who like this sense of humor, but there were better parodies in films by acclaimed directors like Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I'm working in a movie theater and a DVD store, and the success of that movie was similar in both areas: in the movies, it was a good (but not great) success for the first two weeks, but when the reviews of those who saw this was not very good, the movie fell very fast. In DVD sales was good for a short time, but no one else asked. For the last ten years, the two worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can not decide which one was worse, but I'm glad there are so many good movies, so I do not need to think about it too much.
