The script is so laughable ... this, in turn, makes the actors' speeches seem rigid and unreal and unbelievable. There are repeated phrases - "my dear little divine daughter" and small variations of that line that comes to mind ... and it is just a sloppy dialogue with the novel. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the music is so WRONG. ! Also, the main theme "blues" is terribly strange and totally wrong for that. And it seems excessive mainly because the instrumentation, texture and arrangement of this theme never change, even when the emotional context of the scene does it. Later, whenever it appears, it stands out as a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The music is cheesy, and it's as if the writer was writing music for a soap or a sitcom - a low-budget Canadian sitcom of the '80s - and it makes you feel like we're always at home. edge of playing in a commercial. <br /> <br /> This is so wrong, there is a lot of exaggeration and it is really difficult for so many of these characters to use only ONE type of NY accent - a thick bronx accent. I do not know if it's a matter of the limited ability of the actors to know just one NY accent - or whether it's a matter of the director's ability to perceive such a glaring anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the amateur script with its lead lines that make all this "movie" ... explode. When any foundation is unstable and unstable, it is impossible to build upon it without its failures unfolding in exponentially more harmful and unfavorable ways.
