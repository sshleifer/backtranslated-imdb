The writer / director of this film obviously does not know anything about movies. I think the DP in this project was tied up and replaced by a monkey, because all seen was either too dark or had hot spots warmer than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was horrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. For someone to have said that this movie was made for poker fans and not for movie fans, that someone is making a mistake (probably the screenwriter / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. Going into a casino and playing some hands does not give you the experience of writing about poker. Keep your day job. And if you're playing poker then you must be hurt.
