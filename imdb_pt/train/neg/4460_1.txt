HORRENDOUS! Avoid like the plague. I would rate this in the 10 best worst movies ever. Special effects, acting, humor, sound, etc. seem to be done by daycare students ... wait, I've seen better programs than that. It opens like a soft porn show with a bare naked woman doing a shower scene, then going bad from there. Good scenes of nudity, but that's it. Problems with sound and light were persistent throughout the film. Sometimes I swore I heard the roar of the camera's engines. YIKES! I would like to see another film in this story, but made by different people. This group of actors and staff needs more acting classes and film production. Voted 1 in 10.
