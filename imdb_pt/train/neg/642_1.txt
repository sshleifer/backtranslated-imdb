First of all, if you're a comic book fan, well, you're going to be very disappointed, I'm sure! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in the comics, now suddenly he becomes Croatian, pfff! producers of chicken, gave a bit of spice and courage to the comics (By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and he speaks Croatian ... Lol). The impressive N.Y. Winch building becomes a common yacht in H.K. The beautiful Largo becomes a Turkish-looking Tzigan. Freddy the cool 'scarface' pilot becomes a fat guy, out of shape, sad, mean. Simon, Largo's good friend, does not exist at all! He gave some pepper! Largo does not play knives, but only a few snake stares ... The whole story is confusing and looks like a pretentious TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, the skill or the technology to adapt the comics correctly, please stick with some romances filmed in Paris. Bad movie, good thing I just rented, do not count on me to watch the sequel (if there is any!).
