Given the chance to write, direct and star in my own film, I would probably choose something about female robot with weapons. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen. "Slipstream" is such a weird movie that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say, "What's going on?" <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which, in one scene, a man crosses the street towards a yellow car turned to the right, which suddenly turns into a pink car turned to the left. This is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing walls. This is a movie in which a man begins to talk about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers" only for the actor from that particular movie to suddenly appear as himself (and then disappear into the air). <br /> <br /> This is a film that decides to release the need for a coherent plot straight from the window and use fifteen different edits while doing so as well as switching from black and white to colorful for seemingly no reason I should, however, praise Mr. Hopkins for his choice of actors in this film (some of which portray multiple characters). Everyone involved gets thrown into their roles even though they probably have no idea what they are doing. My favorite here was Christian Slater's thug in a hat that was shockingly menacing while babbling nonsense and singing the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins was quoted as saying that he made this film a joke and that this is possibly the best way to sum up "Slipstream". It's a joke in the public. You'll watch from start to finish, trying to figure out what's going on and waiting for the answer to come, only to find that the answer never comes. What's the joke for that particular joke, only Anthony Hopkins will know. <br /> <br /> I mentioned David Lynch earlier and I am a big fan of that particular director. I would say that Anthony Hopkins shares my love for the likes of "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" is not as satisfying as any of Lynch's films, although he imitates many of his techniques (although I was surprised to find that no one talks backwards in "Slipstream"). It is very chaotic and random - as another reviewer pointed out here, it is the cinematic version of Alzheimer's disease. No doubt there are a small number out there who is able to watch it and extract something from it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slipstream" quickly becomes an irritating and confusing experience that was only made due to Hopkins' involvement. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
