Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" on this island) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very lean, and as Air Force friends return to the United States with a Cobra Curse, action is just a waiting game. See Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend that the rest is not happening.
