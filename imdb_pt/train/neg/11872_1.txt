The only way to deal with a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with their message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They feed a deer for a year and then kill him for eating his food after killing his mother. pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions. They blame bears and deer for "behaving badly" by eating, failing to take responsibility for using appropriate locks and fences, or even learning to shoot, instead of twice mutilating animals and letting them stay.
