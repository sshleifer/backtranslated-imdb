I expected this movie to be slightly fun, like other genre types. However, I was lame and I did not find myself laughing much. Watch HBO maybe, or if you have a free rental to spend and need a movie to pass the time. But I would not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it could have been funny, perhaps, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be hilarious, and he laughs a few times here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just do not go see this one. The steering is lackluster, but for what it is, driving is not that important. I think its main disadvantage is that it's not very funny. See something else, do not waste your time here.
