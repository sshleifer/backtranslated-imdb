At least with the teen geek getting the girls' movies, the guy is generally unpopular with girls. At the age of 40, he is replaced by a 40-year-old man who is popular with women but somehow remained a virgin. But then you should not involve your brain with this movie or do I miss the little bit about being in a coma 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> One of a series of films in which 40 and a few years act as teenagers and women for some reason finds this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced these excellent TV comedies seems to think that it needs to rely on rude and shallow characters to laugh at. They made the movies gross. They did the let's act like all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where will they go next? <br /> <br /> This movie is crude and crude entertainment, with nothing to recommend it.
