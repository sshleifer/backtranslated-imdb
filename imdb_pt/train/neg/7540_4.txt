The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I can not say it's one I regret watching. I could go on talking about the negative aspects of the film, such as the terrible acting and the long scenes in which Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination, followed by another hallucination, followed by a sequence of dreams - with a hallucination, etc. but it's not worth talking about when it comes to a movie like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you should watch The Wicker Man, even if it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that he has some genuinely scary ideas, the only problem is in his execution tacky and unintentionally funny. If nothing else, this is a movie that can inspire you to see the original 1973 film, or even read the tale on which it is based. <br /> <br /> 4. For an extravagant horror / suspense, it's really aesthetically pleasing. It's pretty obvious that it was filmed locally instead of using green screen or elaborate scenarios, so we can see some very good scenarios. There are also many well-composed photos. It's a very beautiful film. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not as much an actor as he is a force of nature. Whether you're a fan of him or not, it seems like it's impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy." There's always some kind of eccentricity or nerdism he brings to the characters he plays, and personally, I'm always fascinated by watching him in whatever movie he plays. Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible, he always brings his unique energy into play, and he is never annoying to watch. He's terrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student could probably write a good article about this movie as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist film ever made. "Watch?" you could write: "this is what happens when women can run a society!" In addition, the similarities between this society "Summersisle" and a colony of bees are quite interesting and noteworthy. <br /> <br /> 1. If you're reading this, there's probably a good chance you've seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" from the film, including Cage running in a suit of bear and of course the infamous "AAGHH !! THE BEES !! MY EYES !!!" line. These scenes are hilarious out of context, and they're still pretty funny while watching them in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD used in Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you figure it out, it's about a dollar for a reason. It's a good deal. <br /> <br /> NOTE: The film version is the best to watch, and it is best to watch the theatrical version just for its small addition in the epilogue, which features a special participation of James.
