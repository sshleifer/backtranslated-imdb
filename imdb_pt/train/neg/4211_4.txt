About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I would watch over and over again. But now ... I do not know. In fact, I think this movie would have been great for the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a lot of heavy commentary actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a pretty kitschy plot. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding a bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says, "Hey, Tyler! Where are you going? The MOON ??" Look also for the classic line, "Do you feel on your toes?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is better than "The Good Son."
