Except for the acting of Meryl Streep, which is noteworthy as always, I would avoid this movie because it has a quality of "Movie of the Week" dated. But it's worth noting if you keep in mind the various sub-groups: how a couple suffers from media scrutiny and how the different are treated. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the question is the credibility of the different. Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come to it with an air of "strangeness" about them. The couple involved is religious (different from most cultures) and Adventist (different) in that. So your lifestyle and mentality are suspect to begin with. Dingoes are different animals from other dogs, so again, we come across strange questions. The true story, then, is how society (and the world) treats the different, those who have different accents, different beliefs, than we do and how we treat what they say as suspects. <br /> <br /> It's hard to hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!" no laughing and there are humorous posts, unfortunately, all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the film was discovered (as you will see in the web searches) that much larger children were persecuted by dingoes. Research done by dingo experts showed that it was not only possible, but very likely that the baby would be taken by dingoes (perhaps a couple), skillfully extracted from the clothing and eaten in no time. <br /> <br /> However, what lies behind is the question of why people defended dingoes when they were considered dangerous, instead of killing the dingo to save the children, because the affection of the woman (expression ) is so cold that she's considered guilty, and so on. <br /> <br /> Haunted questions, with or without the movie.
