This is not a movie. It's a collection of unrelated, ill-conceived and poorly-mounted scenes that look like the unedited results of a 10-year-old with a mini-DV camera. In fact, I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the aisle of the train - the one with the greasy hair, the dead gaze, the ipod, and the nervous tic - probably threw her into a creative phase. <br /> <br /> If you did it more than the ten minutes I did, do not bother trying to fit what you saw in the context of the European Artist mentality praised above. This is a true and complete waste of time, money and film that would have made William One-Shot Beaudine shrink. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum packed characters is representative of what now passes through much of humanity. <br /> <br /> What's next? Six directors filming social relationships at Wal-Mart's snack bar?
