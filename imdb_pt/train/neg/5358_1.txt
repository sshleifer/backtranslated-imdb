It is obvious that all the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from people who have been involved with the film or who know someone who knows someone and therefore have seen several cuts. Well, I do not know anyone involved, and I've seen the final cut, and it's just crap. The only thing he has for this is ambition and multiple appearances of horror legends (none on the screen for long). It's as if the filmmakers made this film over a weekend during a horror convention and made actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman shoot scenes during their coffee breaks. This is a supersonic and inexpensive X-Files, with a terrible performance from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; It is an overly explanatory dialogue that tries to explain a meaningless and complicated plot. The FX computer is a joke, but there are not enough of them nor enough action to make this movie enjoyable in an MST3K way. After about 8 scenes followed by nothing but conversations, you will find the fast forward button ... and do not let go. Absolutely worthless.
