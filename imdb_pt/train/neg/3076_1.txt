This movie is not to be seen unless you're trying to kill yourself. I think this movie can cause severe brain damage. The main characters are the non-hero Whiny, Kevin, Amy, his rude and conservative girlfriend, Kyle, an idiot in red shorts who enjoys sex on the phone, Daphne, a skinny and horny girl who should be "cool" and has no sense of how to dress, and her supersexual boyfriend Nick, an army recruit who can make an insinuation of anything. No, I'm not a pervert, that's REALLY how the movie goes. The film itself is an excessive imitation of the 1986 gremlins, but you will never find a trace of Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, released by the Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), make the dreams of somebody else crazy, and then they kill the victims. Yeah, you guessed it- Eventually, they end up in a strip club, where Amy's biggest nerdy dream is revealed, she wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this movie via MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot making a joke on this movie train and it still made me bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had. I'm not giving you any more plot because reviving it gives me a great urge to drive a trident through my brain. Moreover, it is not as if there was a plot worthy of mention. They should put Surgeon General Notice on this film.
