Disney has not yet seen a movie that could not do at least two sequels. And this was no exception for the Disney people to give a weak story to receive a quick reward. Somehow, although I did not pay to see it, I feel trifled by watching it. <br /> <br /> Ariel is now grown and had a daughter. However, he does not allow his daughter to enter the sea because of some idle threat made by the sister of the deceased sea-witch. So here we go again. <br /> <br /> The daughter is cheated (of course) and helps the sea witch. After a not-so-glorious battle, she is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to see here. Get back into your life. "D-"
