Although it's an R movie, I really doubt you really enjoy it unless you're a teenager. <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real plot, no character development, no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie has is nudity. Tons and tons of girls naked or almost naked (very beautiful I could add) to celebrate their eyes. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why this movie has the title of American Pie, since it is a bad combination of an erotic movie and a comedy without success in any of them. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked girls, but you're too shy to rent / buy an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> Gave 1/10 for the 2 smiles I had throughout the movie and another 2/10 for the good puppies
