This is a stinky classic with a great cast, mostly seniors who went well beyond their cousin's and bedtime on this one. <br /> <br /> This is a very depressing movie when you think about it. Remain on Earth, and you will face the disease and eventually its disappearance. Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance. Too bad the film did not focus on that. Maureen Stapleton, looking dejected, was still in the footsteps of "Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom," much more than the 10 years before. <br /> <br /> I just hope this movie does not encourage the elderly. committing mass suicide at the level of Jim Jones. How can anyone be stupid enough to like that and tell you to think? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this absurdity? <br /> <br /> If the veterans were doing this, a wonderful thing in the end, why was the young man encouraged to leave the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg also leave the ship? After all, he had found his beloved. <br /> <br /> This would have been a good movie if the elders had just found their source of youth on earth and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, at the moment, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and you know who else has left. The writers should have taken the script and put it with that group as well.
