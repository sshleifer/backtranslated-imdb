This film is not only annoying, it is also very poorly done. The graphics are so bad they are not even second-rate - they are terrible. The characters do not show any facial expression, the dubbing is empty and without any soul, and the plot absolutely lacks ... well ... everything and everything. My 5 year old likes it - but thinks it's a bit annoying. I agree with him.
