Where to start?! . . . I feel ... raped! That's right, violated! I just spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours that I could have spent doing something more useful, like watch the paint dry, in this movie called horror. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not dramatic, it has no action, it has nothing ... <br /> <br /> It's predictable, annoying, tragic ... /> <br /> I can come a little hard here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, I do not watch ... unless you want to feel violated too.
