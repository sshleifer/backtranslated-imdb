I could have given this movie a higher rating before the Peter Jackson trilogy comes out, but seeing the two side by side simply no comparison. The pace of this movie is rushed, many important scenes from the book are left out and there is little character development. The animation is an odd mix of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that have been painted, which I found to be a distraction. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks down in the middle of the story and was never finished. There are some positives - the battle scenes are thrilling to watch, and the dialogue follows the book practically to the letter. Watch this if you are in a hurry and can not spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you will probably be confused because there is a lot missing in this version. 4 out of 10.
