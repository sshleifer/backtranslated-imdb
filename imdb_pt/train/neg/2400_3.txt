No, this was not one of the ten worst films of the '80s, but it certainly surpasses the 100 lowest points somewhere. This movie seems to have been put on the shelf for two or three years and released in 1981. How else would you explain the pre-dating special effects "An American Werewolf in London", disc still being considered legal, and Ronald Reagan not being the 40th President of the United States? While we're at it, let's not forget the 70's and 60's hairstyles in the 50's and 60's. I've seen more of that here than in "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" combined. <br /> <br /> The only woman who has elevated this movie to the "so bad, good" category was the late Elizabeth Hartman, but only badly. Biff plays as Miss Montgomery, the high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that was made to death and is still being produced by Hollywood today, but even as a "hottie" she retains her mouse qualities. Your request for help is proof of this. She also looks much better like Miss Wimp. "Seven bucks in the salon, thrown to hell." She was not joking. <br /> <br /> That's not to say that there's no good part elsewhere, they're few and far between, and I'm not saying that because I like Hartman. In fact, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than that, and that was not so good. <br /> <br />
