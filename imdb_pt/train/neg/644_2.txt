We all ask ourselves "why do not they remake horror movies that were just good, instead of redoing those that were already great, so they can only get better?" as well as prom night that re-enacted the average but useless 1980's fun movie Jamie Lee Curtis and did it EVEN OLDER. It's a painting by horror movie numbers that is clearly trying to attract young people (hence no violence etc), the knife in this movie slasher is rude. The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the killer pretty attractive seem a bit scary so that everything else comes out the window. The cast that includes Britney Snow (who was superb in Hairspray) tries her best but the material gives them nothing other than pouting and looking scared. More annoying is how the death scenes are handled (we'll hear the attack , but will not see). It also seems that the only place the knife in this movie worked was in the editing suite, since the movie seems to have been massacred (I think anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so it did not scare the kids). pours the money from the Americans by sending this movie to number 1 at the box office !!! Horror movies are a lot of fun, but in the case of Prom Nights this made me want to download the original. I've seen more frightening episodes of OC and Dawsons Creek
