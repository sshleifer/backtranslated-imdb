This movie is a scam! The names are grossly mispronounced and the plot distorted and twisted into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast. And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / beast weapon. Beowulf does not need a weapon like that! In the poem, he rips out Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can not believe the writers did such a thing. The way Grendel is portrayed is impressive however. This and the cast are the only good points of the feature. My English teacher would go mad if she saw this abomination. Unless you're a diehard fan of the epic poem "Beowulf," avoid this movie at all costs. And even then, I would not recommend it.
