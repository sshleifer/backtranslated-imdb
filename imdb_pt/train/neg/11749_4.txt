Phil the Alien is one of those quirky movies in which humor is based on the weirdness of everything, more than in real situations. At first it was very weird and very funny, but as the movie progressed, I did not do it. Find funny jokes or oddities. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget film (this is never a problem in itself), there were some very interesting characters, but eventually I lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine this movie would appeal to a drug addict who is currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but better to try "Brother from another planet"
