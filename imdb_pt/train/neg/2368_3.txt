All right, this is stupid, they say they're not making another Nightmare movie, that this is the "last" ... And what do they do? They keep making each other, not that the next one (part7) is bad, but why do they touch us? Anyway this movie made no sense, was extremely annoying, the characters were highly one-dimensional, Freddy was another joker, which is too stupid for such a good series. The plot is very, very bad, and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. I did not get the movie, it's a stupid 3-D story, nonsense! I hated this movie so much that I still remember all the parts I did not like that were basically the whole movie. This is so different than the prequels, he tries, and tries, but this one tried the hardest, and slapped his face. Again, there were scenes of death, although they were different, they sucked all the time. How could they have gone so far? Did not they see that they made the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5? However, do they do this? It's all about the money, DO NOT SEE THIS CRAZY EXCUSE FOR A NIGHTMARE SERIES. <br /> <br /> I gave a nightmare on the street ELM SIX (6) 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD MOVIE POINTS: It had potential with plot. <br /> <br /> BAD MOVIE POINTS: Terrible acting / lack of deaths / Very funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
