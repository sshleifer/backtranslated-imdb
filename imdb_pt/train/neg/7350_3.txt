Despite very bad comments, did I just have to give this movie a try? After all, he plays the HK star Shu Qi, as well as six other Eastern loves, as a team of action cat hunters. Surely worth checking? Well, as baby festivals go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. Eye drops are first class. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as ever, and from the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang have captured my private eye. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if someone judges this movie for any other merit possible, it is an absolute stink! The story is weak, the action of poor quality and the frankly pathetic special effects. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing gave us a photogenic cast and little else. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you are thinking of seeing this, you'd better watch Sex and Zen 2 again!
