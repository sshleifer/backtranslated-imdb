What can I say? I'm a fan of horror and action movies 'over the top'. Especially when it comes with a lot of humor and innuendo, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane. <br /> <br /> There are three potential draws for this movie: ?? The comedy of the situation; ??? The horror; and ?? The novelty of hundreds of snakes being an airplane. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this movie is not written as an ironic humor or a comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the movie in which you smile to yourself. If you want to get the feel of the movie, the trailer genuinely represents the movie, a horror. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you are expecting a movie full of action and shocks, you will not be disappointed. . It does not stand out above other movies, but it always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Third, although Snakes of a Plane's novelty does not disappear, but you'll leave the cinema thinking "what's all the fuss about." <br /> <br /> I know this movie has a high rating, but it does not add up. A) Many of the reviews were written before the movie was released, and B) The detailing of user ratings has much less variation than normal 77% of people rate the movie 10/10, with only 7% of people giving 9 / 10 - Why such a huge gap?
