First of all, this movie reminded me of the old movies that I used to watch in religion class at school. This is not a good thing. Basically, it's just crap and pretense of filth, just like the awful "Left Behind" series. I am not offended by religious films ... but I am offended when these religious films are extremely terrible. I wish I could say good things about a Christian movie, but it does not look like it's going to happen soon enough. I bet if you gave the Bible sycophants a decent budget, they still could not think of anything good. Just avoid this one. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (basically, Reverend Wildmon's sluts) talks about the movie on their site is another reason to hate me. In fact, after I saw this, I went home and watched my copy of David Cronenberg's "Crash", rated NC-17. Forgive me father for I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
