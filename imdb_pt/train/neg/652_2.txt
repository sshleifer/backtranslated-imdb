I think it was a crap PG-13 overrated! At least the performance of the BRITTANY SNOW was good and others like the IDRIS ELBA were also good, but some other teens at the ball as the main friends were not so convincing. The killer was so dumb and he looked so stupid too. The killings were stupid, boring, and completely unoriginal. The film was very boring and very overrated. It was not all suspense, I almost fell asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, it really is a terrible IMO movie. The end was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring. The movie is also very slow. Overall, the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW I think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too, but in addition it was a completely terrible movie and horrible remake. Well, that's just my opinion. I gave it a 2/10.
