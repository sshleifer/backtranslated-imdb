To try to conceive something as insipid as SENTINEL would be very difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and loaded with holes in the plot. Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who "took one" to Reagan during the attempt of his life. Years later, we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family, mainly as First Lady's Keeper (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise when we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails in a polygraph test, he is appointed as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series). <br /> <br /> As the plot of the presidential assassination unfolds, Pete finds himself outlawed by his own people. Her only confidant is the First Lady, and she is reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for each other (which is why Pete failed the polygraph first). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help avoid the attempted murder while running the Secret Service? <br /> <br /> The one big, overwhelming problem with this movie is that there is no justification for the motive behind the presidential threat. Is not that what the movie should be about? Someone might think so! But the public never lets it out because the killers want to kill Prez. Hmm. Anyone forget to put this in the script somewhere? <br /> <br /> What about the new partner of David Breckinridge (Kiefer), Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, the path of CARLITA)? It looks like it was put into the movie strictly as a piece of a candy. What was your purpose again? Did she do anything other than look beautiful in tight pants and a low-cut blouse? <br /> <br /> There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel that they are laughable. The action is very easily frustrated by "What ...?" answers will surely be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie.
