This was spoken to death by critics when honestly not so good. Of course, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same film, with only suspense variations. But I found the "CHAOS" nicer because it was fast like the silly movie "Swordfish". The reason this movie is most popular is because this was released in the United States and "Chaos" aired around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and USA. It's true that this movie does many homages to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that does not mean it's a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Watch if nothing else is on TV, but you'll probably be bored after a while.
