Oh, honey, this movie was bad for a lot of reasons. I was hoping to see a very low score for this movie and I was a bit surprised by the overall score. Sorry, but to rate this much as many have, it's a joke! Once you've gotten past the trick of a black / white movie / shoot, which was a good idea, the movie creeps even in a runtime of just 66 minutes. The sequence of credits in the beginning was also very boring! In the van the guys suffered a flat tire and changed the wheel, wow, that was necessary in history! How slow were the chasing guys and really managing to hurt Campbell? They do not seem to bother continuing to chase after you ... sigh ... I'm really glad I got it for free with a special edition of Evil Dead !!
