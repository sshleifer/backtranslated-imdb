A doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplant is experimenting secretly on hospital corpses with varying success. His final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket while retrieving a burning vehicle. <br /> <br /> I was looking for cheese and with this premise I thought I had found it. It has everything the bad movie hunters look for - chest and brain surgery with surgeons coming out with white scrubs, unique camera angles (I always love seeing the back wheels of cars), tacky clarinet stripper music and one of the longest scenes of death in movie history. But unfortunately, those bad times that are good can not get past the bad bits too much. Jan in the Pan annoyed me, his monotonous monologues in a hoarse whisper. , laughter a little less than evil, and the fact that she was kept alive with some Colombian coffee and two DD batteries. <br /> <br /> I could not even entertain myself with Dr. Bill's horrifying self-righteous self-criticism. . Usually, this ham makes these films mandatory, in my opinion, in that case I was bored with it. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie, in my opinion, was the 1960s version of "body shopping" and I even found myself dozing during it. <br /> <br /> Do not spend money on it - there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sickly sense of humor.
