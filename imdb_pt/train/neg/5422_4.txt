What "noise" can not do is understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer deal with the city's intrusive noises, particularly car alarms. It's a weird idea for a movie, which has as much creative credibility as "Death Wish". He is intelligent in points; particularly a scene where our hero is trying to read Hagel: "I'm too dumb to understand that." He reads and re-read a paragraph in confusion, we read it and do not understand it. Only then does a car alarm go off. Throughout the film is constant interference from the city's alarms and noises. After all, it does little to help us understand our hero, who allows all this to ruin his marriage and distracts himself with secondary plots instead of digging deeper into his personality. <br /> <br /> The cinema itself is oblivious to noticing its own sound problems, poor quality editing and visible sound mics. No, "Noise" is not all bad. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the end does not fall. In general, take home a logistical point, one that you probably did not think about. At least I had not. After all, ninety minutes, it could not have ended sooner. The story dragged on and seemed lost as it began. <br /> <br /> This is another one of those movies you can see at a film festival, but it will probably not be chosen for distribution. Check it out on DVD if you are really partial to someone involved in the project. Otherwise, skip this.
