I do not give much credit to the conspiracy theories of AIDS, but it is sociologically interesting to see the dramatized phenomenon. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of fear and death often spawned these somber fantasies. This was especially true of San Francisco's politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde. The city, known for its beauty, rarely appeared uglier than in this movie. A sense of darkness and decay permeates every scene. While acting and plot can not be said to succeed, the film's unique cultural context and oppressive black humor, at least in part, spare the film from being a complete loss. In fact, I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a rabid and cynical Jewish and lesbian (?) Police detective. She is interesting, though not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Highlights: The use of Turandot is truculently tragic and has a sublime and sublime participation of iconic performative artist Ron Athey.
