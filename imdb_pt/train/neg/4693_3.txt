This is exactly the kind of movie that frustrates me the most. Great cast, great director, great story potential, so they mess it all up with a script that goes nowhere ... and does not say anything while going there! There is no depth here. No depth of characters, no plot depth, no depth of surprise, suspense or common sense. We know what's going on, we're told how they plan to fix the problem, they fix the problem, they throw us a surprise near the end that does not generate suspense, so they abruptly end the movie. Timely wasted. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Glenn Ford leads a cast of UK (and French) actors who are all fantastic, doing an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they have received. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie" which provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth for a somber and serious movie. I also thought the film had a great look ... all the shadows and haze ... very film noir. <br /> <br /> Although the actors do their best and the direction is pleasant, it is still not enough for me to recommend spending the time to see the film. There are many better Glenn Ford movies out there: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
