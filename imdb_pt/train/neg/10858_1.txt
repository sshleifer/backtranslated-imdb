I did not know if I would laugh or cry when I saw this. Only fans addicted to the danni filth could have a taste for it. This is supposed to be a horror movie, but there is only filth in it. The coolest scene is the car accident, with real special effects from the best of Hollywood. Avoid this movie at all costs. See this just for studies of how bad a movie can be ................
