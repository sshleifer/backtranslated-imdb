I'd like to know more about this movie when I rented it. I would put in my queue based on Heather Graham and her strong credibility as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the film were charming, much of the film seemed artificial, underdeveloped, or otherwise boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking that the brothers were a couple ... I do not care how much of the story is, it still felt a bit, disgusting. And Charlie, to a zoologist, she certainly does not seem to be much attuned to signs of other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (apart from her warmth and some common interests) that made Gray fall in love with her? The story could have been much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who found it irritating from time to time), the taxi driver in the drag and the dance sequences (if Sam and Gray were great dancers, I wish I had seen more of it, as the bits that were shown were actually better than most of the rest of the movie). It could have been better.
