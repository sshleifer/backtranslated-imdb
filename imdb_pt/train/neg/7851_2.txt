As has been said countless times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is not a remake of the 1980s (generally disregarded) sequel to Wes Craven's 1977 original. But wishing to give this postmodern continuation an official label of Diminishing Returns, Craven himself (a double threat alongside his son, Jonathan) has decided to write a movie that is of the same quality - in clear English, HORRIBLE. Former music video director Martin Weisz takes the reins of Alexandre Aja, and is clearly in the way of his head - yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film of Cravens' Screen writing 101 scribbles. It's not just the characters (in this case, a gang of silly national guards who have been sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake) completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre traps (played without a hint of irony, remember ), but they are constantly telling jokes that are not funny. After seeing his total ineptitude during a training exercise, his fate against the repulsive cannibals is painfully obvious. But this time - as in the original sequence of the 1980s - the script is so simplistic (almost nonexistent, in fact) that any potential subtext is ruled out in favor of raising the bet on repulsive shocks (we are treated with a combined delivery - murders during the opening credits, plus a free rape for those who did not eject the DVD in the middle! Even the mutants on this ride are crazy with no personality and no memorable stature - the sticky, rubber-look FX makeup looks like the rest of the movie "I really groaned at the lame 'surprise' at the end of Aja's great film, and the producers literally broke up at the end of Hills 2, setting the stage - VERY poorly setting the stage - for a third film.However, the Cravens and Weisz created a film that is a cynical bastardism of what made the 1977/2006 versions work and that they would have difficulty finding an audi INSTANCE after this insulting slap in the face.
