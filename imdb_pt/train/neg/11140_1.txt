I thought I was going to watch a horror movie ... and I ended up laughing all the way through the movie. In the scene where the human turned into a werewolf, I thought they were joking. Today, computer games have ten times better animations. Low budget, is an appropriate comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. It has good special effects as it should be (humans turning into a werewolf). Unless you want to have a good laugh, I would not recommend that you watch this movie. This movie is a joke.
