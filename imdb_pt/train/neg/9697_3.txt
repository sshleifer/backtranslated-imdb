I saw the first of the dwarven movies and sometimes I had fun watching. There are many famous TV / Comedy actors appearing in the first part and presenting in costume costumes typical little episodes of their Stand-Up program and exactly that is the problem with which the second movie has to fight. Everything was already there ... nothing new to get. You're familiar with most boring, stupid "jokes" and you always feel that their goal was to put the whole Comedylooser from the last decade that wants to return to the stage. There is nothing important in history: a typical fairy tale story of Rumpelstiltskin, without any significance. I expected something like that, but that's nothing I can complain about. In fact, I'm complaining to the lazy story writers who had a whole background story; their only business was to get a lot of jokes and parodies inside, but they could not do it anyway. This crap is, except for the great appearance of Helge Schneider, a total waste of time and money (if you do not like it then remove 2 points from my rating) If you like to save your money and make bad jokes then look at the crap that is great released every Friday night on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you'll recognize some of the "laughs" I saw last night at the movies.
