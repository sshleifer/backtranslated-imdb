I do not see that. This was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. It's hard to be Mormon at times when there are movies like this out there. What a sad vision of the Mormon life. I can tell you if you saw this movie that not everything is like this in a singles ward. if it was I do not think I would have gotten through it. It's a shame that most Mormon movies are made by a bunch of geeks who have nothing better to do. The acting was so bad that my wife and I barely got through. I guess you could say you had all the signs of a B movie or are there any C movies? anyway ... I just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese. I wish some Mormons started making quality films.
