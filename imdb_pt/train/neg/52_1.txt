I was excited to see a film from Catalonia in the Berlin competition. But after the presentation, I was totally disappointed and furious. A lot of blood, a lot of time, a lot of themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, nothing beautiful, is shown in countless films and plays, as well as the relationships between homosexuals and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga tries, is a pseudo-tragedy that may belong to the worst in the history of the film. It's really a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I do not advise anyone under any circumstances to go see this movie.
