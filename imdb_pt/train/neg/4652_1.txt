This was a painful example of a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian TV stations to meet local content quotas. The writing was really terrible and I'm not surprised that the writers are responsible for the worst Australian movie in the recent memory of Honerable Wally Norman. <br /> <br /> Nothing about this TV series was funny - never - not even slightly fun. It was just tired and bad and, worst of all, really thought it was funny. It was just embarrassing to watch. <br /> <br /> There is something very sweaty about this show being given 10 out of 10 on IMDb. Try to find a (real) review by an Australian (real) program viewer (there were not many) and it's impossible. Or crazy. There are breads that are funnier than this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid the show at all costs and if it comes out on DVD, remember that the laughter it deserves was not intentional.
