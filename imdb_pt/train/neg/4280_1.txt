This should be accompanied by a special classification and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> Daneliuc's obsession with the dirtiest bodily functions here becomes a nightmare. Moreover, it is evident that man is a misanthrope, he hates everyone - his country, his people, his actors, his work. And that hatred blinds him and he forgets the profession he had known for a long time. <br /> <br /> This so-called "movie" is just a horrendous sequence of disgusting images, with no artistic value and no professionalistic knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and common sense. Shame, shame, shame!
