It is somewhat revealing that most of the great reviews for the IMDb movie come from people who only reviewed a movie in their entire career in IMDb and, yes, you guessed it: the movie is "Parasomnia". I've always suspected good criticism about IMDb for what turns out to be a good thing, but good movies like low-key marketing, but it seems quite transparent in this case. <br /> <br /> That's not to say that Parassonia is terrible, but it's not quite the good or great movie it had the potential to be. On the plus side, there's a great villain in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job of projecting threats and evils, I could easily see him taking what it takes to play a truly memorable villain on an equal footing with Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact, if the film had decided to explore this terrain, more could have been better. The actual concept of undue abuse of hypnosis is great as well. <br /> <br /> Although I understand that suspending disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it is the mark of a good story that gets you to do it. . If you feel uncomfortable with what you find illogical or just plain silly, then the story is missing you and that is what has continued to happen to me with this movie. Other reviewers mentioned this here and I do not want to get into spoiler territory, but I will say that the setup at the end was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not to mention the variable mental age of a character who is supposed to have experienced only a few years of life. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is the germ of a great idea here in the diabolically misused hypnotism, but unfortunately this film can not perform it in anything special.
