I gave up trying to figure out which version of it I'm watching. The copyright at the end indicates 1983. And although that is not the important part of my objection to this film, I will say that by watching a film obviously made in the Age of Aquarius (including long-haired hippie and hateful vans), but with a Trail synthesized sound from the 80's is unsettling. Extremely unsettling. <br /> <br /> My main objection here is: HOW DARE THE DIRECTORS BREAK BEAUTIFUL LIKE A BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN VIVO. How dare they. Seriously, she's all adorable and such, but in the two movies I've seen her in - that crap and the excellent Legend of Hell House - they kill her. <BR> I would like to put the film industry on the alert. Pamela Franklin apparently retired from the deal, but if she decides to make another movie and some grumpy director tries to kill her, I'll ask him to step off. <br /> <br /> NOBODY BEATS UP TO PAMELA FRANKLIN AND STAY AWAY WITH HIM. I'm very peaceful. FURY WAS UNLOCKED. <br /> <br /> For B movie fans who are looking for a bestseller, you can do a lot worse than that. On the plus side, this is not a film that involves Satanism in a circumspect and circumspect way - this film is a satanic hardcore movie. <br /> <br /> Satanic wall-to-wall ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, a ridicule. Mouse Attack - What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> This excellent material is almost ruined by the bewildering synthesizer soundtrack of the 1980s, which is as incompatible with a movie as possible. The soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear at The Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> In addition, they made Pamela Franklin smash her charming English accent, which was also very rude, if not a cruel atrocity (against the beholder) as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration. of human rights. I say we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice. Who's with me? I could forgive everything else about this movie if they did not abuse Pamela Franklin. And so I play the glove down, gentlemen - ANY PERSON WITH PAMELA FRANKLIN MENSA WITH ME. <br /> <br /> Even in a fictional context. Good morning, Sirs.
