this has to be one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I saw the trailer for the first time in 1991, it looked great. Since then, I've always wanted to see him, but I've never been able to find him ... until today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> Let's just say I was so disappointed that it's unreal, OK, I knew I would not be an Oscar winner, but I still hoped it would be fun movie without brain in the blood mold. Unfortunately it was not, it's Pooh <br /> <br /> who has all the American rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was pretty scary. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were nonsense and looked fake. <br /> <br /> This DVD only cost me £ 5 and I believe I was overwhelmed by £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad as I know I'll never get this hour and a half back .
