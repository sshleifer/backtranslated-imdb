Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the water ... Another computer-generated crocodile hunting for human flesh, let loose by another of those facilities conducting mad science. The company Gereco Biotech is playing with growth hormone research, accidentally releasing a crocodile cub that is evolving at an accelerated rate. The cast of "B" movies adds a lot of fun to this "genetic mistake" monster movie. "Mandylor Costs evokes Mick Dundee, Australian accent, hat, big knife, works as a specialist in crocodile hired by Gereco's executive, Joanna Pacula (.. wasted on the stereotypical role of the corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the giant beast of his facility) set free in innocent people.) Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose town is in and Jane Longenecker is her hottie daughter, who works in the animal shelter.The star of the novel Matthew Borlenghi is the love interest of Longenecker, a local artist who welds sculptures (her brother is a crocodile victim.) Of course, this ability will be very useful when our heroes create a trap created for the croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. The crocodile itself is never at all convincing through you are a reservation looking for food, special effects of a low-grade variety. Regarding Roger Corman's productions dealing with renegade dinosaurs, I get Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on its hind legs, often standing while chasing potential victims. I felt that Mandylor and the filmmakers were fooling Crocodile Dundee with his crocodile hunter, and this imitation can amuse where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have very good chemistry together on the screen. As expected, Pacula receives his commuppance in a hilarious way (.. gulp).
