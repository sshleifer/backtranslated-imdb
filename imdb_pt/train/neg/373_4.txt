Blank check is a movie I saw on TV one day and like most of the movies they broadcast on TV, the blank check was not that good. First of all, no one I've ever met saw Blank Check and this includes people who grew up in the 1990s. Also Blank Check will not be remembered in the 00s, either simply because it will be overshadowed by pixar movies. I would not call Blank Check a bad movie, but neither is it fun. (Or at least not for anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check is not a fun movie because nothing is original. Everything makes you go "what I have not seen before?" Blank Check rips and tries to profit from everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which strangely both have Macaulay Culkin). Blank Check is not a bad movie but deserves to disappear in the dark.
