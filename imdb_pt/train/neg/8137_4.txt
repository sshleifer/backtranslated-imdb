Stewart Moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife, and gets the feeling that he was cast for this role for his ability to roll his eyes in his head ... imagine the auditions for this .. "you can ... no, that's not it, thank you, then!" Anyway, he's bit by a bat, and then he's turning into some kind of bat creature and killing people either. .. he is not. For no one else sees his strange transformations, but he himself seems to think that he is changing because his wedding ring appears when his hands become claws, etc. To his credit, the movie kind of sure if he's crazy or not he's actually turning into something until almost the end. This has some good sites and kind of a decent atmosphere at times, but unfortunately none of this can make up for the somewhat lame story and wonderfully poor acting. Kind of fun in a "so bad it's good" way, but leaning over for just plain bad. 4 out of 10.
