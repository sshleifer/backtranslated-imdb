99.999% pure shit. And the other 0.001% was a brief moment when I thought the blonde girl would undress. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendarily bad. The action was a drug, and there was no sex (the blond girl mentioned earlier is modestly dressed, unfortunately, the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen in the movies, and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring. Act was mediocre even by Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only "names" in this film. And Marina Sirtis looked very, very bad. <br /> <br /> I've seen better produced high school plays. This is the kind of movie in which MST3K has thrived. Heads should roll on Sci-Fi by allowing this smoking stack to remain in the air.
