First of all, I'm not really a fan of any kind of "meat-eating stuff in a new and disgusting way," but I'm a bad fan of movies, so my neighbor said he had the worst movie ever. This one. Then we began to watch. Firstly - it is recorded on a sans tripod camcorder! Second, the thin white doctor's voice is dubbed by a big black man! Thirdly, none of the dialogues makes any sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and full of makeup and tomato paste, lead me to believe that the director (and my neighbor) needs psychological help. It's funny for about 5 minutes, but it gets old fast. It's so amateurish that it's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook ... with zombies. A note to anyone involved with this movie - I want the 20 minutes of my life that I spent watching this, before falling asleep, back.
