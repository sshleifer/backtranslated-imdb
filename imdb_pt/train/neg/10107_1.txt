Last weekend I bought this 'zombie movie' from the bargain box and watched with some friends thinking it would be a budget version of 'Land of the Dead'. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems like they spent much of their budget on the cover art, which is very misleading for fans of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> We watch the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone. They actually talk to the guy before one of the girls kills him; but once they started driving the car, I could not suspend my disbelief anymore. <br /> <br /> Some people actually consider this a "so bad, it's good" movie, they're liars. I did not finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mentions that they actually became cops at the end of the film, which makes me happy not to have seen them all. <br /> <br /> This is even worse than "Zombiez" DO NOT SEE!
