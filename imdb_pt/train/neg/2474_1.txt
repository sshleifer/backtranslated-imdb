While watching this movie I was thinking, okay, it will be fine anytime ... I was wrong. The best real part of this movie was when it was over. A complete waste of 92 minutes. All seriousness aside the best part was when the Wendigo finally showed up, which was at the end and you could not even see it as well. And the tail end was kind of stupid, too. There were many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen, but it was a disappointment. The worst part is that there have been more conversations about Wendigo, so there was Wendigo. For the creature to be so bad, you definitely could not say that for this movie.
