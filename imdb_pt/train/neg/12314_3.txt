Maybe I'm really getting old, but this one just missed me and the old Funny Bone. Surely there must be something wrong with this Irishman (it's me, Schultz!). Lord, Lord, what would I give to see the light! In the first place, Phil Silvers' manic energy, wit, and motivation were a very important part of the comic creation and general education in life, if you will. While it is possible that the series, first titled "You Will Never Get Rich" (1955-59 *) could have entered the CBS TV Network with another person in the title role of Sgt. Bilko, it is very difficult to imagine any other actor / comedian on the branch wearing the sergeant's stripes. <br /> <br /> Such a strong identification is inescapable, though not the same sort of career wreck of a nightmare that proved to be for some other guys, such as Clayton More ("THE LONE RANGER"), George Reeves "THE ADVENTURES OF THE SUPERMAN") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). A major obstacle to successfully adapting and updating this type of work, from the TV screen of the 1950s to the public that goes to the movies in the 1990s, is our collective memory. Unsure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the Bilko character of seeing the original race and the first trade union revivals, and their numbers were certainly considerable; even a large segment of young people watched Bilko's reruns in recent times. It was obvious that the new movie and the source were miles; or even light years away. <br /> <br /> In order not to be considered a totally square grumpy, please, let's consider some other points. <br /> <br /> Right here today, the 14th day of November in The Year of Our Lord 2007, let me swearing and swearing under oath that I have been a fan of Steve Martin for almost 30 years, moreover , I enjoyed the intelligence and talents of Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and the late Phil Hartman. After all, it was the talents of guys like this and so many others, Alumni of "NBC; s Saturday Night" and "SECOND CITY TV" who kept the last quarter of the 20th century laughing. But a refill of BILKO; he just did not click. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the movie had been made as a Service Comedy (I always liked them!) but without the Bilko Show names and gave it some identity of itself, it would be more highly regarded by guys old and cranky like me. <br /> <br /> So we've had so many comedy and cartoon series turning movies lately, what's next? Howse about someone doing the World War II Army comedy series of sergeants DOUBLEDAY & AMES and the TV cartoon series "CROSS COUNTRY"? Remember where you first heard! POODLE SCHNITZ!
