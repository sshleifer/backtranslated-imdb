Worst movie on earth. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can save someone else from punishing themselves with this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to bad porn without sex. The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and they could not have been worse, even if they were trying to mock that movie. The movie must have had a low budget record that I'm sure was wasted almost exclusively on the cover of the movie. This film has become a joke with my friends and has become the standard for comparing other junk films. I'd like to point out that no other movie begins to compare. I personally feel responsible for suggesting that a friend and I watch this movie and we were surprised that she still considered me a friend after the torment I experienced. I do not see this movie!
