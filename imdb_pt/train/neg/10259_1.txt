I saw this film in the movies when I was a child and I always remember it as my first experience of being stolen by a horrible movie with a good commercial. The commercial was great, but I later found out that there was every explosion or "special effect" in the entire movie (about 4) and even some that were not in the movie. There was some kind of alien-related plot, but the aliens were never really shown in the movie as much as I can remember. It was clearly a case of someone making a buck from a cheap movie designed to fool people. I think my world of innocence ended that day when I discovered that there were bad people out there making bad movies.
