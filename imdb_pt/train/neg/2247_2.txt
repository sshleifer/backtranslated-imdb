Kris Kristofferson, in his drugged peak in the mid-1970s, finds himself almost unable to squeeze himself on the screen alongside the huge ego and feminism of La Streisand discount stores. <br /> <br /> None of the characters is really nice; I was very happy when the Kristofferson Ferrari passed that hill and fell. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (done only about a year and a half) after this dreck.
