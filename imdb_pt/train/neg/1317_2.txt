When the Kino Video crew assembled their "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection, a selection of several silent comedies, someone decided to launch the first one with ONE TOO MANY (1916), an obscure farce from a Florida-made roll starring the very young Oliver Hardy. However pleasant the scenario, the decision was unfortunate, because ONE TOOY is a very bad movie, which almost discourages the viewer from continuing to watch. Like any typical farce, this involves deception inspired by greed, panic when plans go wrong, and complications grow to the point of absurdity, but unlike good ones, ONE TOOY is incoherent, bland and downright irritating. It is hard to say at this point whether the desperately confused plot is the result of lost footage or inept footage, but whatever the cause, even halfway to the most alert viewer has no idea what the characters' relationships are or what is happening The only point of interest here is to see the "Babe" Hardy, 24, who looks considerably heavier than a decade later when he joined it. Stan Laurel, but still full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, waking up with a hangover, Babe does a highly athletic test behind the bed. Trust me, this is as funny as this movie. If you read this before seeing the first cassette of Kino's "Slapstick Encyclopedia", I suggest you go through it quickly and jump to the good stuff.
