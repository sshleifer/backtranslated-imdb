This movie had some great actors in it! Unfortunately they forgot how to act. I was hoping the movie would get better as it happened, but the acting was so robotic that it was doomed from the start. In fact, it looked like maybe the actors were reading a screenplay all the time. Maybe it was the soundtrack or the director himself, but one thing is certain: the makeup artist needs to get another job! The Face Powder was so thick that you could see it hardened on the faces of the actors! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder it never hit theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods is a shame to you for not giving your all. The lot was great just needed much more.
