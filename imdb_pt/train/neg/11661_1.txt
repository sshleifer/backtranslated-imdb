Basically, this is an excessive / bland action / comedy. First of all I would like to say that I liked Wayans' brother Scary Movie (1) and the sequel had its moments. Unfortunately the white girls do not even give half the laughs. <br /> <br /> The humor is absolutely rude. If you like phrases of burp effect, fart, stupid, you should probably look at this. When it's not rude, it's stupid. The first 10 minutes of the movie gave everything to me, totally bland, just stupid. <br /> <br /> However, I watched the whole thing since I was with a friend (otherwise I would not have bothered). The story is undeniably fine, it was in horror film too, but at least the laughter was quick and steady. I think this is probably one of the main problems too with this movie, the laughter does not come fast enough. Some jokes are dragged for a long time when they are more disgusting than funny at first. If you prefer your comedy with some brain cells, avoid that. If you want a silly comedy with more laughter, then look at the horror movie, airplane, 1 + 2 figurines. 1/10 Completely bland, Thin plot, A movie that seems to be based on an idea (that is, what if we dress like white kittens for a movie?), but we simply do not have enough material.
