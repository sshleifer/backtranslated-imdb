Bad aliens have a huge debt to the early films of Peter Jacksons, Bad Taste and Braindead. I must confess that I have never liked these particular movies and I say the same about it. Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration and chooses to steal those he admires. I lost count of the amount of times a major Hollywood movie was quoted most notably James Camerons Aliens. The amount of blood and blood in the show here is not funny either, the end of the movie becomes tired Maybe it worked better as a short film. The actors are poor, the direction is weak and the plot is non-existent. I can see what the director was trying to do, the homage he was trying to pay, but others did the same thing much better than the one presented here. 4/10
