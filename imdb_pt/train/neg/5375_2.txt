Having just watched this movie, I almost feel like I've lost 2 hours of my life, but I think there's something good about everything: If I were to rate this as any other movie, it can only receive 1 or 2 tops, but if I rate it as a low budget ind. movie, can reach 3 or 4. That is a movie is supposed to be "complete" and without long passages of boredom or loss of time. This movie is not. But I think many independent films are about showing skills in the movies, and considering this, this movie has some highlights. If I want to comment on what the directors should take with them to the next project, I think the distorted sound effects had some quality. They also manage to build some characters, but this leads me to what they should leave out on their next project, because the character's development takes a lot of time as it is mostly irrelevant to the movie's plot. Long stretches of walking time should not be continued on the next project - what is the goal? I think this movie tries to be a bit of everything (building characters, suspense and a plot), and ends up being nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie tries a lot and very difficult, and I think it should have been cut to a short film. I could easily manage to find an hour's walk or a meaningless dialogue to cut out of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are many irrelevant things going on in this movie. The story should have been simplified. I know there must be some mystery in this movie, but a slight surprise to who the killer is, does not make a mystery. The story behind the "mystery" almost gets no attention during the film, which leaves the final "point" as a fast and unsatisfactory finale. <br /> <br /> So I'd like to say that this movie was a good try, but I can not. I hope directors will learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you have no interest in learning how to produce low budget movies, there is no need to watch it - I do not even see why everyone thinks it's bad. <br /> <br /> As others have already stated, I'm sure the many 10 that are given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie. This movie can not get a "10" from any objective point of view.
