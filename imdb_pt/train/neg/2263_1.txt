Ok, let me say that I did not expect a movie starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all I asked was for it to be cinematic ... and it was not even that. It looked like someone's bad home movies. Badly acted, scripted and filled to the brim with the nudity of the most uninteresting people I have ever seen. The plot of the film focuses on a lower-class family that decides to go to the "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss various issues between a mother, daughter, stepfather and daughter's fiancee. From there, the film fails and develops into a unique experience: white trash pornography. Is there gay sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to leave the theater and do a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and degrading. African Americans and the American working class should be offended. (Howard Stern was supposed to be satisfied, however, he did not waste his attempt at film stardom.) He was clever, fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F + (the daughter was hot)
