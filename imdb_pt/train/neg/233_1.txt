This movie is a calculated attempt to win the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they had called Sex at a Funeral, they could have done better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the movie sits between two chairs and can not stand up. Characters emit unlikely dialogues, but they never act remotely recognizable as humans. An arbitrary, meaningless action follows another to advance what passes through a conspiracy, and soon gets tired of the falsehood of the whole enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell earns points by acting with her little heart, but performance honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton, as of all things, a police detective (they do not have a height requirement there ?). Staunton seems unable to make a false move. Could we say the same thing about the writer-director? <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill bother you for being fake, stay away from that. Phonus bolognus on the half shell.
