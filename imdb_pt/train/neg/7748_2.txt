This movie was really bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel, so I watch all the original movies that play on it. I really do not know if this movie can be called the original. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island seems quite familiar. Which was, oh yeah, Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tigers instead. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with some stereotyped college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up horribly dying with some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. The blood looked a lot like ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many Sabertooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and are going to eat tourists, or people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. Again, it sounds like Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000-pound saber tooth that crawled on its front legs killing the mad scientist with a kind of tooth statue that somehow shrinks and runs down the staff neck. The funniest death I've ever seen on TV. <br /> <br /> The acting is extremely tacky, the special effects are horrible. CG tigers could almost go through clay models, and even some of the sounds were off. For example, when one of the students is trying to escape, he uses an ax to break a door, the ax enters the door, and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was really bad. The cheesy deaths were very funny.
