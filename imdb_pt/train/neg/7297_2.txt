Escape from all and try your luck alone. B.) Have sex with your girlfriend friends. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs. D.) Bash in the head his childhood best friend and lifelong passion with a shovel. E.) All of the above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is so improbable.

The total lack of reality and the illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations put that film in the dog head compartment at their local rental store. To stay away. Stay away.
