I run a group to stop the comedians from exploring, and I've spent the last two months listening to horror stories of comedians trying to audition for Last Comic Standing. If they do not have a good agent then they do not even have the chance to audition, so over 80% of the comedians that appear are rejected before showing someone that they have talent! If they get a hearing, they told me it's "pre-determined" if they get a second chance. So what the TV audience sees are NOT the best comics in the US. <br /> <br /> If comics come to the show, most of them do not get IMDb credits. I know this because I made the credits for all 6 seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and I'm not paid for doing the work of the producers. It's really a disgrace. A month ago, I asked: "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook, why the producers are not giving credits to IMDb and I got banned from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I do not have a personal stake in it. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to see anyone being exploited and that's why I've been helping the comedians. The comedians are exploited by HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a great network for those responsible to be ashamed to allow such exploitation to take place. <br /> <br /> Please watch this comedic video that was victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
