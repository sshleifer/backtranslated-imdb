The main character Lance Barton is dead and to heaven before his time. When heaven learns about the error, it receives the body of the deceased old and rich white Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black man in an old white man's body still behaving like the young black man is perhaps funny if you see this done by an old white actor. In this film I have been reminded several times: "Chris Rock should be a white and old guy." <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not work as intended: "illusion" is not well transported and the love story is not believable in any way. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock playing a young black man because the old white person that everyone should see is shown only in small scenes, it's a big challenge for viewers to "suspend disbelief."
