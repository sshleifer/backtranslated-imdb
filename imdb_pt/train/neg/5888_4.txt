I saw this recently on an old faded VHS tape and vaguely remembered it. Looking at him now, he looks charming. <br /> <br /> When it was released, it was recognized by virtually everyone as a parody of being a gay teenager. To get it right, the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of "1 Teenager In 10," the most popular book of the season. David Warner is a stalker vampire hunter, which is, of course, a case of self-loathing. The list of gags and internal jokes that were included to ensure that no one would miss the point would be too long to enter. The producers were having a good time, and they hoped, without doubt, to illuminate and illuminate. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how a teenage audience would look at this movie, nowadays. . In some places, where there is education and culture, the terrible trials that gay teenagers have had to go through are things of the past. But I'm sure there are many dark and unpleasant corners of our continent where it's as bad as it always was.
