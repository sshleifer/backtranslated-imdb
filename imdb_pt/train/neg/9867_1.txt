Saw a screener of this before last year's awards season, did not really know why they gave up after the voting was over, but whatever, maybe by exposure at least, but the movie was a complicated mess. Of course, some parts were funny in a good mood, but none of the characters seemed very real to me. There was not one person I could connect with, and I think that's where she failed me. Of course, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive in relation to Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see if this has not already been mined to the point of futility. The whole ordeal seems false, from the lighting, the cast, the script to the horrible visual effects (which is supposed to be intentional, I can tell, and so everyone can, but no one is laughing with you). Anyway, I hope it's on DVD for sale at least, I would not like a project that a lot of people obviously made a great effort to go completely unnoticed. But it sucks anyway. Complaint boring with that.
