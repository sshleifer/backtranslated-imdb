I could not give this movie a bad review or bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and there are some disturbing elements that lean towards the psychological, something the film might have focused on a bit. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a storytelling DJ who is going through personal issues: his lover moves and Gabriel is having what appears to be a storyteller blocking affair. One day he receives and reads a story written by a 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. He lives with his foster mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to find him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist. I will not go into detail because I do not want to spoil the movie, but I'll tell you: it's quite predictable. Fascinating atmosphere to tell a story and good performances by Robin Williams and Toni Collette, who I thought was the key character of the film. Collette is undoubtedly one of the most talented and lovely actresses. Her ability to explore the psyche and personality of the characters she plays is very strange and I hope to see her win an Oscar (hell, I think she could get a Best Supporting Actress award for this one if the script was a little better) . The film begins as a psychological but predictable thriller. If your curious to know the end of the movie and twists, then see the movie otherwise I would rent another predictable suspense called "Hide and Seek."
