Considering the risk of showing relationships between people of the same sex before the late 1980s, Personal Best could have made the same-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) a more than experimental phase of life of Cahill. It seems to me that the creators of this film have launched a same-sex relationship between two very attractive women in order to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women by jumping back on a high heeled pole. This random scene had VERY POOR relevance to the movie and it seemed like this was only meant to keep the audience interested in this bland movie. I suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring storyline and even more boring scenario of the film (the 1980 Oregon Athletics Competition). This criticism may sound harsh, but it is the truth. Exploitation of the young man Muriel Hemingway's body and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit I would have given to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
