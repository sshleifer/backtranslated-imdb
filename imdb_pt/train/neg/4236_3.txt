Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and a bit of modern psychophysics, watching the live performances is the only thing worth watching. This film has tons and tons of gang appearances, along with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-important role, and many goofy death scenes. Looks like it can be good, right? Well, the killings keep coming, and repeatedly to many different Warp Tour bands and fans at the event. Some of the deaths begin with style, but are then recycled repeatedly, to the point of being completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies of having their heads crushed, or intestines being taken from the stomach. The blood seems to have been from "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence", by Andreas Schnaas; with this being the "blood type diluted," but now that the film is really decent, and provides humor, something this movie lacks terribly. Of course, the film is made by Troma's Doug Sakmann, has great potential for low budget, and tries ... but it's very difficult. Everything is made to be funny in this movie, and that's what brings you down. Everything tries to be very comical and goofy, using intentionally poor performance, overuse of meaningless deaths, and doing the same thing ... over and over. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker," "Council President," or whatever movie you've done with your friends: it's funny to those who did, and that's about it. Potential, great idea, great use of effects - but it's the same thing ... again and again: a band plays, a band dies, fans die. Everyone dies, blood is spilled everywhere, the process repeats itself. <br /> <br /> The point is, are these types of films - which are basically "bad stick" - trying too hard, or not?
