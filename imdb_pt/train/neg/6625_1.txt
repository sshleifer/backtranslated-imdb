this is the first time I'm writing a comment about a movie on IMDb. but I had to write it for this. his three hours of unadulterated torture. from the beginning you have the idea that the movie is going to be bad. the acting is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan (I loved him in bhagat singh), but he's at his worst in this movie. Amitabh seems to have worked hard for this, but somehow fear is lacking. Prashant Raj is a non-actor. and the most annoying part of the movie is nisha kothari. I have no idea why the director took her in this movie. the background score is repetitive. Somehow I felt that Ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background punctuation, the camera angles, but it did not work. PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT
