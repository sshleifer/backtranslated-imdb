A friend of mine bought this movie for Â£ 1, and even then it was very expensive. Despite having great names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this movie was as funny as picking up a chisel and hammering it right into your ear. He uses tired, drum-bottomed comedic techniques - constantly breaking the fourth wall as Sandler speaks to audiences, and seemingly senseless assemblies of "hot girls." Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship. who wants to do this as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the blatantly named "Dickie" because of his unfathomable success with the opposite sex - is presumed lost at sea, Sandler Shecker's character gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's locked tight in the bathroom, presumably sea sick. <br /> <br /> Maybe from his mouth he spewed the worst movie ever.
