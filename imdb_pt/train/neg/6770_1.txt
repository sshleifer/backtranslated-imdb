I went to see this movie with my 17 year old daughter. I insisted that we were the matinee showing, not because I'm a stingy, but just feeling that I had. In the spirit of NASCAR, this is a sponsor's dream. So much blatant advertising, almost qualifies as an info-commercial, if it were not for the so-called performance. Keeping the tradition, Herbie's franchise continues with its cheesy story lines, the car is just a 'vehicle' (no pun intended) for this cornball of a movie. The first episodes of Herbie (though extravagant too) were produced during more serious times, making them a little easier to digest. Lohan, the queen of the Disney drama, has little ability to act. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon were involved in such a project. Just the snack bar, it was a bigger ripoff!
