The story begins slowly and nothing funny happens for a while. All the action is at the end, but you will not have to laugh because the movie is funny, but because the story is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The funniest part is when Harvey 'I'm Not Paranoia' Keitel really loses and the judge starts a massacre. Oscar for this guy!
