I also saw this incredibly bad piece of "anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to watch this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few beers, then you can get some enjoyment out of it. <br /> <br /> I found the hilarious dialogue lodged in my mind is the introduction of Cremator. The animation is awful. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. It might have been a good idea for producers to have hired at least one non-colorblind person. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more to say, this movie is a failure on all levels.
