After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that spoiled Scooby-Doo's success forever. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo who made this show a complete failure, probably for adults and children together. Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always seemed ready to hit someone. Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain, and they were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need any boring bastard nephews. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should have killed or never thought of Scrappy. This was just poor, maybe your kids will prefer it!
