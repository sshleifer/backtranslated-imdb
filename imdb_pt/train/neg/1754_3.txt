Why did the stories of Maria and Rhoda have to be so serious? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original show and characters? Her daughter's characters were foolish and uninteresting. Why can not there be daughters who like their mother on TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to New York, but why could not Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be invited guests? It just seems a pitiful way to remember these wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together, of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Meeting, a Dick Van Dyke Show Meeting, hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her former Mary Richards recreation area again.
