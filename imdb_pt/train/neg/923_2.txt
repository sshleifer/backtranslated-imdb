For some reason, several young couples walking through the Italian Alps separate to see who can first get to the camp designation. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of "Tyranus" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. He then spends the rest of the movie running in the woods, hunting down his friends and cutting off his limbs to add a stew to bring the undead Demonicus back to life. This Full Moon release is stupid, meaningless, has terrible acting and sound, and (Los) Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy. However, it is very high on the unintentional laughter scale, thanks mainly to the performance of the lead overwrought. Whether with bulging eyes running in cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or grunting neurotic Latin scribbles about demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward delivery of the line must be seen to be believed. Well, at least he's not annoying like most of the rest of the cast.
