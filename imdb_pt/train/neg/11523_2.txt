"Igor and the Lunatics" is a totally inept and amateur attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. Apparently, even almost twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring creators of overly enthusiastic but incompetent trash films. This is a typical Troma production, which means, in other words, that there are many boring and totally irrelevant scenes to accompany the meaningless plot. Is there a bit of random gore and free nudity on display ?? What is not bad? but it's all very meaningless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so desperate that he is using many of the scenes twice, as the circle saw, for example, killing. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addict and aspiring Charlie Manson, Paul. One of Paul's low-level disciples, named Igor, becomes a bit obsessed with Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes all worship to descend further into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate with just a little example just how crazy Igor is: he rips the heart out of a very smart black girl's chest! There's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some pseudo-artistic camera tricks that are embarrassingly lame, like slow-motion footage and dreary dream sequences. Perhaps there is a sequence that more or less qualifies as valuable to the garbage fanatics and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the picture of the blade in the bloody stomach for fifteen whole seconds.
