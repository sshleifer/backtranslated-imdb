I have the courage to inform you to stay away from Dahmer, the biopic based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer. "Dahmer" deviates more from the mentality of his focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered more than 15 young men and ate some of his body parts, was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick are the filmmakers of this horrible spectacle that should have been examined before deciding to give the green light to this terrible "dahm" project. This is not an easy film to digest, although Jeffrey has easily digested with some 'brainsadillas' appetizers or even some in real life `Mr. Potato peel'. * Failure
