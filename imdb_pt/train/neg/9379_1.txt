This movie . . . I do not know. Why would they have a character as indelible as Pippi Longstocking and would cast the singularly unappealing Tami Erin, I'll never know. Why would they spend money on art and some not so bad special effects, so they would not bother editing it properly, I'll never know. Why the scenarios and costumes are sometimes in the period, and sometimes in a weird way, because they ordered SAY bad songs, because the script does not make any sense (not even on a level of children's film). . . . What were they thinking ?? Nothing about this movie is as it should be. Each part is dubbed (and always badly), each sound effect is a bit wrong, every issue is in the wrong place, every performance is somehow bad. Can create an appropriate atmosphere despite all the problems, but NEVER captures the magic that is the creation of Astrid Lindgren.
