Bashki should be congratulated for trying to convert one of the great works of English fiction into a movie, and then made a fool of that attempt. The animation was bad, the characters looked ridiculous, the music was raucous and the movie was a decrepit blitz in the first and a half book of Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember my disappointment and hatred of the movie when I first saw it. Now I realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is doomed to fail in many ways, simply because of the medium, but this film, regardless of the origin of the story, is simply pathetic. Bashki is capable of much more.
