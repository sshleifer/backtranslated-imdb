What happened to the British TV drama? From John Major to Tony Blair, the focus of the genre seems to have shifted from social realism to tales focused on presumptuously normative women about the inner problems of good middle-class professionals. <br /> <br /> (Or maybe TVNZ no Do not buy the good things? Please let it be what it is ...) <br /> <br /> <br /> The long writer's career in soap operas probably explains why the dialogue is made mostly of obsolete cliches. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong in significant looks, each being held by the director for at least half a dozen more hits than they deserve. What Baleful looks like, however, is a poor substitute for character depth if the writer failed to provide this material for the actors to work on. <br /> <br /> Of course this is theoretically a thriller, about a murder investigation; but this is not as important as the failed marriage of the central character and its associated problems. The husband of Cusack's character is a complete bastard? Will your child be completely traumatized by marriage? Doing these central issues is not a sign of insight - it indicates a deeply narcissistic identification of the writer and director with a character who should be giving continuity to her work. <br /> <br /> Lynda La Plante knows how to write these things so that it seems important and involves spectators who are not internal neurotics; evidently Paula Milne is not up to the task.
