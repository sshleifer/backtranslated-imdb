This is not a good movie. Very nailed in parts and the plot was sub insignificant. The 3D was OK but not great. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies who want to have adventure and move on. The characters are missing, I really do not care about these characters and feel like there was nothing to keep an adult interested. Pixar this is not. <br /> <br /> I would have liked to see more special 3D effects. I would also like to see more fly jokes than the mother constantly saying "Lord of the Flies" Pretty sexist in showing women how domestic wives and fainting.
