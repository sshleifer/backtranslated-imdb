If you can get through the "classic" Meyer titles / introductions, you can go through anything. But would you want to? I did not find much there to dig my teeth. I suppose if you get into it with low expectations, you'll be delighted (at Charlie's Angels). But for my money I would like something more, more visual, more moving. More. I feel like I'm begging for porridge @ the master's foot. the man got the goods. but he simply does not share.
