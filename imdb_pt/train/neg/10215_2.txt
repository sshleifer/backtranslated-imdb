A horribly useless movie and, worse, boring. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no character beyond the most unimaginable stereotypes and relies on a clumsy central concept that is not particularly original or treated in a loosely innovative way. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is totally wasted on what he supposedly expected to be his response to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and replaces his usual screaming routine (I admit it's very funny if you discount Talledega Nights) for, well , practically nothing. Emma Thompson is no more than mildly annoying (which some comments I've read here are talking about her for an Oscar nomination is laughable), while Maggie Gyllenhaal does an acceptable job with a very weak script that allows Nothing but establish his character as a former law student who left Harvard to become a baker because he liked to make people happy. Please. The fact that she fell in love with Ferrell's "character" is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempts to animate the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight how uninspired the material with which he works. > <br /> I had the choice of attending the Prestige for the third time or seeing this. I wish I had chosen The Prestige.
