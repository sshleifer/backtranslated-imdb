Even though 99.99% of the people who watched this movie are Brazilian, I will continue with English, since it is the language of this site. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of cr * p. Worst performance I've seen in a long time. The kids are terrible. Especially the boy. This was the first time I saw someone with less facial expression than Arnold Schwarzenegger and a single tone of voice, like a five-year-old reading in front of the class. How can anyone be such a bad actor in a movie? The plot is so shallow my daughter could have done better (she is 3 years old). It's so simple it could be written on a napkin and counted in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities for someone to like this movie: 1) you are preteen; 2) you brainwashed the Globe idiots who think that anything that has the Globe seal is incredible; 3) you have serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! A shame for the Brazilian film scene.
