Every Sunday, a trio of friends gather at a NY restaurant to boast about their sexual achievements the night before. Sometimes they join a newly-married ex-comrade and a hoochie hunter who clings to them like a noisy cracker. They are shameless horned dogs and Mia, who witnesses them on the prowl, decides they need to be taught a lesson, dammit. Ergo, she's going to leave and leave - why not? All three! <br /> <br /> Sigh. What a crazy idea. What a radical and impertinent girl. Women now have the right to date and sleep as much as they want. As much as men, even! There is a solitary laughable element in "Whipped" -that is, the fact that not once during the detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the Tantric talents of the bed partners do they do the other customers in the restaurant, turn around and say, "Man, we're trying to eat here." In fact, a heheh-heh gag has an older woman eagerly weighing on the useful sexual properties of certain drinks. A big fat Kermit the Frog "Sheesh" for that. <br /> <br /> It really is unfortunate that a movie of friends with a great scenario, a smart and fluffy heroine and three possible pairs had to have such a complicated end. . PS - 30 sound effects "whip-oosh" for the writer for the use of the phrase "You go, girl". He was tired in 2000 and now he's tired. <br /> <br /> Save your time and watch some reruns of "Sex and the City" ...
