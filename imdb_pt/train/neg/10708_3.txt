This movie has the potential to be really good, considering that some of the elements of the plot are borrowed from the action sci-fi THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always lends some appeal to his roles. But someone somewhere really knocked the ball in this. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a monk (!) who travels to New York to pick up a key that opens a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the Antichrist. for 2000 years. He must fight the footman, who is a spirit jumping from hand to hand, as well as THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. The servant, of course, wants the key so he can let the antichrist leave. Along for the ride is a boring female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the bodies possessed by the minions. <br /> <br /> If I'm making this sound fun, forget it. The pace is very clumsy and slow, the maximum acting, and the fight scenes staged badly. Dolph dreams of his role and launches some of the worst dialogues of his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor actually catches up at the end when the footman fights an army of monks wielding submachine guns at the monastery, but the rest of this movie is scary. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted to like this.
