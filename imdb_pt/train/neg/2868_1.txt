This is really an insult to the victims and their families of BTK killer. The events in this movie are nowhere near the truth. Why they could not make a movie of the actual events does not make any sense, since the actual events are more interesting than that. Do not waste your time watching this for free. Low budget and a shameful description of events that should not be made a joke, which is really what this movie did. If they allowed me to give a -10 for this movie I would. The acting sucks and looks like it was filmed on an old 1980s VHS video camera. Save your time and money by not watching this movie.
