This movement reminded me of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. You have the same kind of idea that people get what they deserve. I think it's always theirs in a Crypt story. The same goes for poor performance. Very poor acting. I liked the movie knowing that most people did not like it and I was not expecting much. Whenever I watch a Stephen King movie, I do not expect too much because all his films are terrible compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie threw away like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such. It was so good. But I noticed that the novels did not look anything like the movies. The finals were very different from the movie versions. I suppose that, from these two novels, all his novels have changed a lot and the finals are always extravagant. The end of Thinner is the worst. Then Cheesy. I want to read the book to find out the real ending. I suggest to all who intend to read the Stephen King novels to watch their films before hand so you can compare. And so you will be very pleased in the book. I plan to do it with all his novels that were made into movies. I'm sure that if they were made into films, they would be really good books ... and the script was terribly wrong.
