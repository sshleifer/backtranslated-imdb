There is nothing I hate more than pretentious self-congratulation. Kevin Smith deserves to be hanged by the toes to inspire all the white middle class whites to make a movie about why they can not get laid. I do not really care about low budget productions and inexperience, but when writing is so obvious and nauseating, it really burns my potatoes. The money put into it could have gone to a filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you watch Project Greenlight, you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who is battling the system. Anyone could get a camera and make a talking image that can not really say anything. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can not come soon. Go watch a real first effort by buying Desperado or researching Friends with Benefits. Thank you and good morning.
