You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you do not particularly want to, a man who produces a horrendous budget after a budget horror unless enthusiastic receptions. But he keeps doing it all the same. Even the indifferent compliment surrounding his Camp Blood movies is unwillingly given and I am as guilty of it as anyone. Brad can usually throw something interesting in the mix, a cool idea, a crazy character, anything but without the funds to go beyond the basic level, he trusts the audience to give him a break and enjoy it for what is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance like Ebenezer Jackson and it is a credit to Sykes that he can realize that this eccentric turn will work within the structure of the movie. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
