If you're hoping to see a lot in Altıoklar's bath, as promised by the slogan, you'll be very disappointed to see that the film consists of nothing more than the populist style of Altıoklar in relation to more famous issues like sex, marriage. and cheating. For a lot of nudity, what seems to appear out of nowhere and has no connection to the plot proves that Altıoklar was, without success, "trying something new", as he quoted. Many sex-centered jokes seem to show that Altıoklar fell in love with the famous saying "sex sells." I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. However, in the end, I found myself sitting for 90 minutes and watching the experimental Altıoklar, but still very focused on the work of popularism.
