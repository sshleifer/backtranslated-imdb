From time to time, in Indian cinema, a film like Sholay appears, which changes the way the public perceives a good movie. And den only once in a while (hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. Such a low standard can never be broken. Ram Gopal Varma manages to take a cauldron of talents and create a dish so old that you can smell it from a distance. Catching a classic as Sholay and Murder is totally unforgivable and I can not believe he almost called the RGV movie ki Sholay. Although Sholay had many folk elements, the film managed to develop its plot simply by defining the characters so differently that they lived forever. What Aag does is pick up these characters and mess them up so badly that you're going to need a contest to pick the worst. The element of realism is totally absent and what the film ends up providing is a bunch of "actors" parading in a smaller and seemingly unrelated scenario. A star for this movie is a ridiculous waste of votes. it is time for the RGV to wake up to the reality of its failure and to create another "different" plot that can be categorized in the cinema.
