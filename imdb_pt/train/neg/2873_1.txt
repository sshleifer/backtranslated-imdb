This film features a beautiful brunette named Danielle Petty. She has stunning green eyes and is in the first scenes and the last scene. She's the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. She may not have a future as an actress because that kind of film is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it to. It's not a good horror movie, nor a good fake journal report, nor remotely well done. There is no apparent ability in its production. It's like a bad student movie. The horrible elements in the story do not make you sick, it's the fact that it's so poorly made that it makes you sick. I would give this film ZERO stars if I could.
