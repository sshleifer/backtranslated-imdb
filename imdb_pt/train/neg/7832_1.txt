I barely made it through an episode ("Crouch End"). The dialog box was flushed and disheartening. The performance was tragic. Eion Bailey, despite his best attempts at being dramatic, remains virtually blank. His eyebrows suggest a recent treatment with botox. Claire Forlani could easily have played the damsel in distress in a silent movie. The characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical gear in mostly random plot, winding plot. Special effects of cheese can be excused given the budget of the TV miniseries. But the attempts to create suspense and surprise through a distractive cinematography increased the impossibility of being used. I have the impression that the ending should be witty and surprising, but it was stupid and had little to do with the rest of the story. If I had to compare their overall quality to something else, I would put this episode of "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" on the same level as NBC's Hercules.
