Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and I went to see the complete film version of "Earth" from DisneyNature. I think that, like car manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think this justifies a special unity with the word "nature" in it. I know my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to tell my personal feelings about Disney a year from now? <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible cinematography, it was a typical disappointment of Disney for me. Preceded by half a dozen Disney movie trailers filled with Disney cliches ("circle of life", "falling in style"), super-dramatic music, recycled material (Disney claims "40% new images"). I was even beginning to think that James Earl Jones' narration is getting a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman making every Warner Brothers storyline begins to wear out. I really think Disney bought some picture of the BBC nature that was made so spectacularly, they thought it would sell itself if they put some orchestral music and recognizable sound-bites into it. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing offspring? There were half a dozen such scenes, with young men bleeding to the point of ripping their throats. I think Disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside the life and death struggles that appeal to the action-oriented teenagers who were dragged into this movie by their parents. I was also aware of how Disney stopped suggesting that man had something to do with climate change. Are they so afraid of the small minority of deniers that they think it's still a controversial subject? <br /> <br /> I recommend skipping this one here and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Nature films seem to be better made by the British at the moment.
