Let me start by saying that I consider myself one of the most (more!) Spectators of open-minded movies ... Movies are my passion, and I'm a big goer from my local movie cult location. I also feel the need to add that they always ask me for advice on movies whenever I get there, and I never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what's going on in the cult-movie -area ... I love renting strange things, and that's exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the cult-movie-video-place guys. He told me he thought I had to see it and as the cover said something about being a movie with an atmosphere of Jodorowsky (one of my favorites!), I rented it. <br /> <br /> The vote I gave here is not really fair, because I did not think it was horrible, I just did not know how to evaluate it. A question mark would have been more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally made me sick to the stomach: I actually felt physically sick! Am I the one whose stomach has literally turned? Still, I did not want to turn it off, or maybe I simply could not, because I was fascinated in an unpleasant way ... <br /> <br /> I never want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> It's not horrible, as I said. It's not just my cup of tea (or wodka) ...
