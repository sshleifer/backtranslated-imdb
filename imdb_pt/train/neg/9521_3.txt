This movie has been getting a lot of work lately during the day on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they are assuming that people would be interested in comparing him to the interpretation of Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks of the same name. The only reason to see this is for the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I must say that Matt was more than a little long in the tooth to play a schoolboy. If he were a woman, they would have thrown him into a high school MOTHER! (Is it just me, or is his daughter starting to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yeah, the plot - who cares? Highjinx typical teen played by adults.
