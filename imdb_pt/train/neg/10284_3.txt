Having seen the men Behind the Sun, I expected an evolution in style and technique to match the larger scale of this film. I was also very interested in seeing someone make a fictional fact-based account of what happened during the most notorious Japanese atrocities, but that's not it. This works like a mid-to mid-70s European Nazi exploration film - for example, SS Experiment Camp etc (maybe more like Special Section Deported Women, actually). It is true that it has a wider reach and more people running around, but it resorts to the same cheap and discouraged device of many unfortunate non-actors who fall to the sound of ridiculously false shots tempered with the occasionally 'shock' barely executed. sequence. The documentary, admittedly horrible, is more or less divided between scenes so trivial that even these real images are robbed of much of its power. Watch Channel 4's "The Holocaust" channel (recently shown (still running?), From January 1, 2006) for a really disturbing documentary about the evils of war (with great use in context of real images). This is the kind of treatment that the horror of Nanjing deserves, not this banal exploitation garbage (a more well-executed exploration film less the disrespectful use of the footage would have been good, but again this is not a very good holding film ). Classification: 3 (5 as exploration, 1 as subject treatment).
