Spoilers. <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing really happened in this movie, other than a woman bleeding inexplicably. Secondly, it was not scary. Third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie of all time. Let me elaborate. Has the sound been edited by Beavis or Butthead? I'm not sure, so we're going with Beavis. The movie gradually gets quieter and people grumble and mutter, forcing you to turn up the volume (I watched it at home). Then Beavis launches some really loud sounds with supposedly scary / shocking images, forcing you to quickly turn the volume down again. This often happens until, fortunately, the movie ends. I can imagine Beavis laughing lazily behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group frantically searching for the remote control each time. If you have children and prefer to watch horror movies after falling asleep, this is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here is a thought? If you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a free decapitation, a 19-year-old blonde girl who screams at the top of her lungs before taking off the sweater, the shadow on someone's wall. being eaten alive just out of camera, a cat being thrown on camera to scare the public, some weirdo with a maniacal laughter, or a monster that looks like a stage hand covered with foil (on TV's Lost in Space)). These people did not even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
