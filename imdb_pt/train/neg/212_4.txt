Closer to reality and containing more depth than "Breakdance," Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still a pretty boring show. Again, this photo is really only profiting from the 'break up' craze, but at least we have some entertainment plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, Nova York. Each has its own unique talent. One is a cheater, one is a dj, another is an artist who creates' burners' while little brother 'Lee is a hot hip hop dancer. <br /> <br /> Lathan is unable to generate any real public interest in the story though, and his young cast are also fighting with their characters. So almost all the funk music and the 'cool' dance are left to save the day. <br /> <br /> The choreography is again sharp for the nightclub and street scenes, but that is not enough to raise "Beat Street" to greater heights. Unfortunately, the film actually falls late, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
