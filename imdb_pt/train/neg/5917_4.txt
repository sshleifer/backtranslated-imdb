This film wants to elaborate that criminals are a product of modern society. So thieves, rapists and murderers (the murderer of this film, Carl Panzram (James Woods), all three and worse) can be held accountable for their actions? An interesting but very difficult notion to bring to the screen in an intellectually and emotionally satisfying way. And this is where Killer: The Journal of Murder is very short. Although the film attempts to put Panzram's behavior in perspective, with flashbacks to his violent youth and dysfunctional education, the viewer never gets the idea that Panzram is a victim and not a culprit. Of course, the system is corrupt, with a mafioso occupying the entire infirmary of Leavenworth Prison (where most of the film happens), most prison guards are sadistic bullies and the prison director is like a megalomaniac despot. But why the hell does the new prison guard, Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard), feel sorry for Panzram? Even after reading your horrible diaries? The film offers some explanations: Fewer witnesses Panzram being beaten by the most sadistic (and stereotyped) guard, and is impressed by Panzram's intelligence (although it is not clear why exactly Lesser thinks this man is so clever). Surely this is not enough to sympathize with a hostile man like Panzram, even if this movie tends to minimize his crimes and highlight his personality? Toward Lesser, Panzram is quite loyal, and the viewer has the impression that for Lesser this overcomes all the atrocities he read in Panzram's diaries. Does this Minor Man have such little friends that he takes seriously everyone who seems remotely friendly to him? Perhaps it is the Lesser that is a product of modern society, judging by appearance and not by substance. <br /> <br /> I can advise Monster, starring Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci, as a movie that deals with the same themes from afar. more integrity and scope. <br /> <br /> BTW: Murderer looks like it's been filmed for TV (not so good)
