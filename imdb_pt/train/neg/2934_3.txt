Simon Pegg stars as Sidney Young, a stereotypical Brit idiot working as a celebrity journalist in this American comedy. After getting a very lucky break, he starts working on the highly respected Sharps magazine, reliably run on Jeff Bridges' New York form. It's more The Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. Unlikely love interest is provided by Kirsten Dunst, who works well with Pegg for the laughter, but they do not exactly set the screen aflame with his passion. <br /> <br /> Sidney goes through some emotional challenges in trying to decide if he should forget his journalistic principles to get material in the magazine. Of course he ends up being seduced by the glitz and glamor of the world of celebrities, especially the young actress Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg has ever experienced similar real-life feelings with this movie and to some extent Run Fat Boy Run as one of the UK's top comedic talents being ruined by the US. <br /> All this is a forgettable comedy. Please come back to us Simon, we can forgive and forget.
