There are two types of musicals from the 50's. First you have the MGM productions with big names and good music. And then you have the minor league with a less famous cast, less famous music and second class directors. 'The Girl Can not Help It' belongs to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, it does not matter. It seems every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is as thin as a razor blade and one can not help suspecting that it is primarily an attempt to sell records to Fats Domino, Little Richard or other of the 50's rock acts that appear in the film. If this song pleases you, it's worth watching. If not, do not bother.
