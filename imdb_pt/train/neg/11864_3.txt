characters at lower depths. You saw all the characters in other movies, I promise. the script tries to be nervous and unpleasant, but fails miserably. that generates a surf attending superbad comedy, but the jokes are out of the left field, completely forced, and are almost completely discarded after they are broken. the hottie is old and has no personality, she's just a blond girl in her thirties with some non-underwear jokes that is less than catchy. the attraction between Molly (the hottie) and Kirk (idiotic love interest) is barely communicated. the attraction nowhere to be found is a completely platonic relationship until the awkward and predictable kiss of the seat belt occurs. afer this they are in a complete relationship and it is simply incredibly lame. The main focus of this film is not the relationship, but a failed attempt to make a super evil movie with a semi-attractive plot. I could compare this with the hangover, in its forced nature. I will not go into it. I could go on, but it's just useless. just do not pay to see this movie.
