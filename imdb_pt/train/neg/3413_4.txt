1st seen 26/12/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny mysterious murder comedy with very few laughs. The film appears to be based on an earlier Italian film, according to the credits, but was rewritten by two rather popular American romantic comedy writers. But this one by Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers does not cut him off in comparison to his other efforts. The story is about a couple of American travelers, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who come across a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return. When they try to return it, they see a hand coming out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the woman's body that should give them the money. They fuse and instead of contacting the police and tell the truth they see as fugitives from the scene waiting to be framed for the murder. The other characters in the film are found on a train before that and stay at a Monte Carlo gambling resort doing a lot of things to get pulled into the story. The other cast members include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police discovers the death, they begin to question the main characters and, of course, they have to work with their silly lies to find out what really happened. None of the character actors mentioned earlier can take this film out of its mediocre state, despite some funny moments provided mainly by the Belushi / Shepherd couple. This is not a horrible movie, not so good. There are plenty of medium-sized movies out there and that's just another one for the stack. Try it, maybe you'll like it, probably you will not.
