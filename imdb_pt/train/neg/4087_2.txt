I usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review, but in this movie there is not much to talk about. Just a hodgepodge of other FAR best sword and witchcraft epics. Lack of cohesion increases as much as banality. Even the main villain who refuses to wear other clothes, so a thong is quite annoying, since she has a boy's chest. Fun in his ineptitude at best and severely retarded at worst. Lucio Fulci was demolishing the bottom of the barrel here and it shows. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Galleries of Posters and Images; Lucio Fulci Bio; and US & International Theatrical Trailers <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is topless all over (some may consider that appealing, I did not); lots of extras are topless as well
