I watch MANY bad movies, MANY !!!!!! It's kind of a hobby, actually. Almost every Saturday, a group of friends and I get together and watch the trash from around the world - ANYTHING. Superhero movies from Turkey, Brazilian vampire movies, Italian gorilla transplant movies, Kevin Costner movies, ANYTHING (except perhaps Raising Helen), but I've never seen a WORST movie than THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even fun in a way Ed Wood - it's just SUCKS. Now this movie was famous in Hollywood at the time it was made because Whoopi took off her gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who heard that she HATES THIS PART OF CRAPE = she tried to leave the contract, she whined, she moaned , but even so they spilled their fat ass in this futuristic leather police uniform that is horrible to see, dammit !!!! And you may just see her boiling during the shots - doing everything but looking off camera for her agent so she can yell at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible that a third-year class could do a better job by promising cookies.
