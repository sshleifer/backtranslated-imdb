Terrible acting for Potter and a flat plot, no tension, that much so. And as for the feminist polemic, it's laughable. I saw this junk when it was released for the first time and despite finding it tedious beyond belief, I'm glad I went to see it. That's because now I have an immediate answer to the question "what was the worst movie you've ever seen?" Besides, I have the comfort of knowing that all the movies I see for the rest of my life will be better than the tango lesson. But I have to admit that I was impressed with how Potter wrote a road map that would bring together the maximum number of Arts Council grants from around the world (as revealed in the final credits). <br /> <br /> I'm just very recently I've seen Orlando and I see how Potter learned the wrong lessons from doing that movie. All that was needed was a bunch of frilly outfits, some staring hard at the camera, and a loose plot to entice the movies to become public. So why should not she think she could get away with the self-indulgent nothingness that is The Tango Lesson?
