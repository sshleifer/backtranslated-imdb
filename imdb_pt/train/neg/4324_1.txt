The goofy Griswalds win the grand prize of the TV show "pig in a poke," and they all fly together to Europe, where they can cause one stupid disaster after another. Of all the ridiculous and dull consequences of the world, this is the best. Harold Ramis's 1983 film was a below-average misfortune, in which the unbalanced family entered a "vacation" nightmare in the United States. This time, Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking") leads what turns out to be a disastrous comedy that will annoy you more than it'll make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Hughes's script (with Rob Klane) is horrible and you wonder why the likes of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo bothered with such an unusual project as even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca had the good sense to refuse the offer. Even an omnipotent Michael Palin is unable to elevate the process to whatever level one might call entertainment. <br /> <br /> However, inconceivable as it may seem, "European Vacation" was successful enough to guarantee a second continuation! It certainly could not be as unbearable as this. You know, I still have to see a National Lampoon show that paid off. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
