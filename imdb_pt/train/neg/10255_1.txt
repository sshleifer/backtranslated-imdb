It has Christopher Lee, has huge computer banks of the 1970s that make teletype noises as the letters appear on the screen, have radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark, but emit pulsating noises, there are volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tsunamis! earthquakes exploding cars! blowing coffee machines! and how climaxes the whole planet explodes. How did this movie get to be so incredibly on-screen? The answer, my friend, is that 90% of that movie is made up of plans, mostly involving long banners, pots or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three, that do nothing except give the crew something to do. There are endless queues of our characters driving, getting in and out of cars, driving around again, walking around looking at things, getting into cars and driving ... I just stood there watching an endless parade of nothing in stupefaction murmuring "Say some something, please someone, just say something ... DO something ... anything! ... "<br /> <br /> The dialogue, when it comes, is terrible. <br /> <br /> "Maybe your minutes are measured on a different scale from ours." It was a typically meaningless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock images, justified in this speech by Lee as the alien of the head: "Planet Earth has issued an excessive abundance of diseases, they are contaminating the Universe All the planets the light years from here will suffer unless they are destroyed! "<br /> <br /> This is the script writing of Neanderthal SF. This is the kind of motivation you find in the kind of Japanese monster clothing movies of the 1950s, intended for 7-year-olds. Yeah, and I collect those things, the most horrifying line of an English movie ever since Buster Crabbe retired. It's unbelievable that this movie was released the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters. <br /> <br /> Lee, who has always struck me as an intelligent and useful actor, with a sure knowledge of its limits, presents his lines. as if he was going to kill his agent by putting him in that drek pile. I do not blame him.
