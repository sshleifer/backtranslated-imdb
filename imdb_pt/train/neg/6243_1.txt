Do not drink the soda. <br /> <br /> This is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary. And calling it "truth" is just crap. The debate on global warming is far from over and will only end when eco-zombies begin to recognize the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you'll find a river of information refuting almost every link in the logic chain that Gore's websites have. The reason it's so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have. Wake up people. Anyone with a computer, a little time and some common sense can find many reasons why this theory does not come close to being believable. Do not just read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis to do, really. There are simply many alternative and counter-evidence possibilities for theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so unbelievable, in fact, that it may be the biggest hoax in the course of human existence. It's time for people to start demonstrating against this kind of propaganda, and it's time for people to admit to yourselves and others that you can be a conservationist and recognize the blatant conclusion that the global warming hysteria is a big one lie.
