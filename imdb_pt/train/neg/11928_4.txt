The Lives of the Saints begins with an atmospheric view of London as a bustling city of bustling and picturesque streets and the sun. I hoped it would keep this atmosphere, but it gets stuck in a story that gets nowhere. <br /> <br /> Othello works for the big fat mr. Karva, his crime boss at least I think that's what he should be because he's never really set, but he puts kittens in fat diapers, so trust me, he's an asshole) doing little errands while his girlfriend gives hand work to Dad. One of his peers is Runner, a black guy who is always running from A to B. Until the day he comes across a child with almost no roof, which gives him the desire to stop running. Runner plays the lost boy in Othello's apartment, where he promptly begins to grant more desires. Eager to have some of his own wishes fulfilled, Karva has the kid kidnapped. But he is not sure what really brings him happiness. Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another manual labor? Anyway, I do not want to see the little boy grant him the second. <br /> <br /> It takes only centuries to get started and there are many repetitive scenes. The ending tries to be shocking, but since there is almost no investment story in any of these characters, it serves only as a release for the bored audience. Writer Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory that ends up being pretentious like all hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting strangely then it would have been a nicer movie. So we are introduced to a bunch of annoying gossipers who then miraculously appear to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who the origins are never revealed. This is just annoying! <br /> <br /> In addition to sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score, this movie has little to recommend.
