I would give it a negative rating if I could. I entered this movie not expecting much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! Snakes are obviously fake and the first two things that bite are a busty and a johnson guy. Oh how original; if I were a 12 year old boy I could laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously, the worst thing I've ever seen. I was not amused, it was not funny, I was not even bored! I was nothing. It was not so bad, it was good, it's bad. Ridiculous actually. Please do not waste your money on this movie. Do not even rent this movie. No clue how you are getting such a high rating.
