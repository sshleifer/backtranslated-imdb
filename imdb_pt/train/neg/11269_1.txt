I must confess I've seen a few screams in my time, but this one is up there with the worst of them. Lot to worry about to follow. Sex and violence played to disorient and distract the film really badly mounted. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the cast will look back on the final product and would like it to put powder together on a shelf so as not to be disturbed for a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case, I have the DVD. He will sit on the shelf and stare at me from time to time.
