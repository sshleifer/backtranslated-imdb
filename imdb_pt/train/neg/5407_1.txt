If you want to watch a real 'quality' movie, take The Eden Formula. This wonderful movie must have cost $ 50 to be made. He has a fine script, pathetically bad ensembles, lighting and camera work, and a paper mache monster that is totally laughable (it seems that sometimes they wear a guy in a rubber suit and / or a glove for the monster - but all were equally terrible). <br /> <br /> All the actors speak their lines as if they had never seen them before and were reading a teleprompter. Special effects are much more than bad. And the only sad thing is that they dropped the really original title 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks', which sums up exactly what you get during the 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard that you break with the raw one underneath. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
