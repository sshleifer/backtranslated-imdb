Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity, but I just watched it for the first time last night and easily fit into my last five of all time. Should it be about the love story or the zombies? This movie was so bad that after it was all over, all I could do was laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. Luckily I'm too anal to flip a movie without seeing the whole thing or I would not be able to brag about watching it all the way at once! I like to think that something positive can be said about anything in life, so according to this theory, I will recognize the most positive asset of the film, it was too short for a full movie.
