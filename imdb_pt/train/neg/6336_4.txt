The Bliss theme update is just the latest in a long line of bad local comedies that appeal to conservative filmmakers. (For the record, this list, all the movies in which they seem to be trying a Castle-esque miracle, includes Strangers Fellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Eggs, The Honorable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes and The Nugget. Crackerjack.) <br /> <br /> Here, the performances never fit, since John Howard does not even seem to be in the right movie ?? although perhaps this was the intention, since Franklin interprets conservative and sleepy suburbs against its more interesting inhabitants. Twenty-year-old virgins living with their parents are becoming rarer on the screen, but this is hardly a reason to watch the movie. In fact, the only reasons can be (1) bizarre Howard? but very fun? performance, and (2) the suburban nightmare theme, which featured Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandra Project, Danny Deckchair, The Rage at Placid Lake, Traveling Light, Teesh & Trude, Swimming Upstream and Lantana, many of which are very good / excellent. Get into your own risk! It may be one for people who laugh at the word "penis". 4/10
