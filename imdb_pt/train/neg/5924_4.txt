Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice - maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time it is not the receptacle of a god (see previous episode), but it is a very famous lady with magical powers that allow her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human answer). Unfortunately, the man who is most in love with her is a pack of few letters and he tries to kill Medusan's ambassador (who, strangely enough, lives in a small box - that's a bad way to travel). And unfortunately, Muldayr is not as well as she is. What happens next is a bit stupid and when the episode ended the first time I saw it, I was quite relieved. Watching all the men on board do ga-ga for Muldaur was very silly, and Spock's acting when he went insane for a moment was exaggerated. Do yourself a favor - if you have not seen the show before, choose a different episode.
