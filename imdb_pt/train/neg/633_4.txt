The Good Earth follows the life of a slave and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to climb Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. He has a strong American accent, like most leading actors, that I could not bear to hear him speak. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood can not overcome its racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles. Picking up the Angles and making them look like the Chinese is similar to Anglo-Americans who put their shoes on their faces to play African-Americans.
