God, I'm so sick of the crap that comes out of America called "Cartoons"! Since the anime became popular, the animators of the USA or produce a cartoon with a 5-year-old, lazy boy. style drawing (Kappa Mikey) or some chirping Japanese animation. (Generally disrupting classic characters) No wonder the anime is outperforming the American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They're not even trying! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard that last night; I live in the UK and when I discovered that this show was released in 2005, well, I never knew that the UK was so up to date with the current shows.
