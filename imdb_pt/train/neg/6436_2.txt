I am a nice person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in a long time. There was very little plot and the deeper and more interesting areas that were touched, that is, what Jesus really wanted us to know, were covered up and instead we received heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). The total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane for both his character and the audience. The acting was just there and the direction was not inspired. And if I saw another drip of water or dove flying toward the camera, I might have started shouting louder than Patricia.
