This movie is horrible. Give me the dentist anytime! Do you believe that one of the main TV stations here in Arabia had this Christmas movie? I can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with Dudley Moore instead. The last time I looked at my bottle of hot water had more acting, better plot, more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid. Do not even see if you're drunk!
