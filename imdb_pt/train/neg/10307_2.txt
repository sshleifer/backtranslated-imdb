The "mathematical" aspect of this is merely an artifice to try to separate this TV show from the millions of other police programs. The only aspect that remains of this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have been (undeserved) in decline after the Northern Exposure if he signed up for this problem. The lack of the "math" aspect of the show is encapsulated in an episode co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which only confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned). In order to catch a fugitive, the "mathematician" uses some theory about "bubbles". So he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in places A, B, and C, we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where it might be. He does it all on a blackboard, or maybe with a stick on the ground (I can not remember). <br /> <br /> Anyway, when you look at the finished product, it basically picks up three dots and picks a dot. right in the middle and said, "Okay, mathematically, this is where we're most likely to find the fugitive." At what point, another character points out, "Oh, that point also becomes the booth where the guy used to live." Is this math? Not even connect-f ** k ** g-points !!! This program reminds me of the mathematics I used to work in the banking industry, which had a mathematical analysis that it could do to "support" points that everyone else had already agreed through less complex analyzes or basic common sense. <Br /> <br /> That only serves to show - when you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait until they stick the NUMB3RS team in OSAMA ... They will use calculus, call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains, and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... because hey ... it's all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> Totally ridiculous TV show.
