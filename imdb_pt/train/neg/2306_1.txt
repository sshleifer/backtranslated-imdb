I wonder what the people who gave this 10 saw that I did not. This movie has a very difficult time to follow and / or get into a storyline. If someone tells you it's a comedy, do not be fooled, it's about 98% percent drama and 2% comedy. All the actors make a great performance, which can not be denied, but it seems that they really lost something somewhere. I do not know if the original script was good and had to be edited or what. This had potential, and instead it was really a failure. I really wish the hour and a half had invested in this movie, but the video rental site does not return in time. Save your money and see something else.
