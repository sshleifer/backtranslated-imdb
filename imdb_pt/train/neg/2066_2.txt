Of course, idiot frat boys who still dominate JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea of ​​fecal matter coming out of the tube, SEX OLYMPICS (I really do not need to give you details, me), and a clown that basically does the little "not very catchy clown "I think I've seen about ninety times now will eat this like dung beetles: well, more power to you. <br /> <br /> I just want to express this, despite what you've heard, this movie was by no means a model for the many infinitely funniest movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or what is not. The movie had already been made in AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, and so on. And done better.
