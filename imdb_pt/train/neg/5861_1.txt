I saw this movie when it was first released in 1978, when I was in second year of high school. I took a date to see this. I did not "get it", needless to say, because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers' career never plummeted as much as she deserved after doing this horrible, unpleasant crap. In fact, unfunny is not a severe enough term: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You leave feeling as if any laughter that could have occurred was beaten from you before it could happen. This is not worth watching out of curiosity, or for any sense of being "so bad it's good". Not even the MST3K class could have made it worth watching! The fact that Billy Crystal's career has survived this precocious suicide attempt is a miracle.
