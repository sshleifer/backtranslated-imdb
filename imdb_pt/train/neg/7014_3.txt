What a waste! This movie might actually have been something decent, but writing in particular sucks, and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical re-creation of the late 1970s decadence was well crafted, but overall, this movie was a great waste of time. Instead, the movie being watched, which deals with similar themes and the same basic time period, is the big BOOGIE NIGHTS.
