Oh, that's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain something like that is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun. I mean, you can see topless porn actresses having sex, then being killed by human mutants. There's a lot of blood, including the classic "something is wrong with it, oh no, it's half the person it used to be" and accidental murder caused by panic. But you can also find funny things like intestines pulled through someone's butt and a guy running in the forest, then finding himself beheaded by a wire tied between two trees (which makes a doii metallic sound then as in cartoons) . Somehow, there is a market for people who go beyond porn, they really need to know what's inside an actress, mere genitals are not enough. Therefore, you can see many autopsies summarized in dead bimbos. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted by taking a role here. I think this is a movie that you should watch with the fast forward button and watch only the videos, just to remember the old school C horror movies.
