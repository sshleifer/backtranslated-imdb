I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday" and co-wrote excellent scripts like "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the person who wrote and / or directed like a tiresome and sad dribble like "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut", and that. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and clich√© that even the efforts of the ever-wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The script sinks in its truly offensive sequence in which the character of Janssen tests the character of Drivas to make sure that he is not gay. An ugly but unfortunately one that could easily play in a movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are now totally banned, but "fag" jokes are still "good, clean, and fun for the family."
