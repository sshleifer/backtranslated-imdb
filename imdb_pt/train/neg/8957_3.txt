Amazing. Is this dumber than that? Not a chance. Stupidity in this movie would embarrass Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part of the series had mediocre dialogue and the second one had bad dialogue, then this one has a crappy dialogue. Amazing. But this time the story has been reduced to the level of dialogue as well. Despite the acting and the dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will certainly kill the franchise. The totally stupid plot obviously derives from the pity of a frustrated leftist. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if these leftists realize how undemocratic and pro-dictatorial they are. In this movie do they obviously target the US? a democracy. Why do not they attack Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. in anti-military films? Of course, most of these places will hardly produce a cube like this anytime soon, but that's beside the point. It's obvious: trash writers like this really admire these types of schemes, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even say that ANYONE who attacks US foreign policy all the time has antidemocratic beliefs at its core. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: besides being so improbable that it is not funnier, the film has many obvious illogics. For example, for some reason, the two men who oversee the cube did this for a while and are unaware of the pain and sadism the project involves, but the first one suddenly turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea about human nature will see well through this idiocy. Or how about that cretinous character, the one-eyed evil bureaucrat who speaks as if he were in a bad comedy by Mel Brooks? In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the movie loses ANY seriousness and therefore any chance to be thrilling: it really becomes a comedy.
