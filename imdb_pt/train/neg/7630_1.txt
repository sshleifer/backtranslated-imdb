A boring movie about a boring city in the 50's. How can anyone think this is a classic? The producer virtually ended his career by pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several films that were far beyond his ability to perform. I think this film gives an idea of ​​how bad future Peter Bogdonovitch films would be. Cybil Shepard's career plunged after several films Peter Bogdonovich produced. It was not until "Moonlighting" that his career began to return. I thought the acting was poor interpretation of the "Graduate". I noticed that this movie was not shown in the US. The only place I watched was outside of Europe late at night.
