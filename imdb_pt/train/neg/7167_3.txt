I saw a trailer for that in another video and decided to rent it when it left. Boy, was I disappointed! The story is extremely boring, the acting (aside from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I could not care less about the characters, besides really wanting to see Nora's husband debating. The role of Christopher Walken is so disposable, what a joke!
