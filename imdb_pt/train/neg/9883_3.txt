Reasons to watch the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Bo Derek at age 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked. She does a great job in an immature and insecure beauty of 16 years, actually <br /> <br /> 2) Many pictures of a beautiful Greek island <br /> <br /> But: <br /> 1) Peter Hooten turns out to be the worst performance of an actor since Brutus played Caeser's friend in "Roman Senate Proceedings of March 15". He delivers any and every line in a delightful baritone below. Turn down the volume whenever it speaks. Preferably until the end <br /> <br /> 2) Bo's fantasies are sadly weak, especially by today's standards. Some laps in the bath and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The plot is more spectacular than Bo's costumes
