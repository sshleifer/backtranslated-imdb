but there are not many of them. Probably the worst "big-break" movie I've seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. It makes no sense to comment on the plot, the cast or the acting. The problem is beyond all that. It puts in the absolute stupidity of the annoying type (not the funny kind) of everything that happens on the screen. I do not know why I gave 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably because of Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes went down the bathroom along with some brain cells. Avoid at any cost.
