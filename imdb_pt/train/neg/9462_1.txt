Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is another big misstep by the MPAA. The whale rider gets a PG-13 but this movie starts a PG? Please. Parents do not be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a big mistake. There were countless times when I found myself uncomfortable not only because the mood was inappropriate for the kids but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the film are the only saving grace. Beautiful Kelly Preston and the always friendly (or hateable, in this case) Alec Baldwin are good in their roles, though Preston is almost too handsome for such a role. The kids are conditioned actors and showcases, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the movie that kept me watching and not throwing things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I did not like him as Shrek's voice, and I really do believe now that Myers should not be allowed to approach the realm of children's movies again. His portrayal of The Cat is a somewhat weakened version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if only for one day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of anger and personal conflicts . <br /> <br /> The Cat of the Hat may be the worst movie for children of all time.
