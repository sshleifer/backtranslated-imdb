This movie is pure guano. Mom always said if you can not say anything good ... but even Mom would say I had to do my part to warn others about this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee that this is the movie that Geoffrey Rush wishes would just go away. I hope Greg Kinnear fired his agent ... from a cannon for giving him the script. After that, Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch "There's still something about Mary." I've always been a Wes Studi fan, I appreciate what you consider sacred that he wore a mask through the film, so maybe people will not identify the film with him. <br /> <br /> Begins promising with a stylistic style. Parody of the cinematography of the Batman movies and then only loses something ... as a coherent plot and half decent effects. <br /> <br /> The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the end of the joke, and yet they fall. If you want to see an effective parody of the comic book world, see "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! Do not walk away from "MYSTERY MEN"!
