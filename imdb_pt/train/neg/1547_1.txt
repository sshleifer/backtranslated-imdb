I could name a lot of funny movies. There are comedies that are funny and they are. Some movies, like a Gymkata, for example, try to be serious, but they end up being funny. The Ladies Man is a movie that is desperately trying to be funny, but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who has a lot of girls in the midst of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust. It's anti-funny. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've laughed more than a laugh at anything in this movie. It is simply bland. It's boring, stupid, annoying, annoying, incredibly bad, but it's not funny. I do not particularly care about Tim Meadows, or this SNL character, but I expected something better than that. <br /> <br /> The film is completely devoid of logic or common sense. It's as if the screenwriter had a bag over his head as he typed and he could not see which keys he was tapping. They tell the "origin" of the Ladies Man, but do not include a motivation for their bizarre fascination in acting as if it were still the seventies. The film tries to take the mood out of a man who seems to enjoy pornography shortly after he tried to hang himself. Is this comedy? I like to consider myself having a fairly sharp sense of humor (spending a lot of time writing comedy like myself), but maybe I'm not bright enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker in There Something About Mary, is outrageously bad here. I was begging him to shut up. In the end I was knocking on my chair, mumbling softly, and if the movie was gone, I probably would have tried suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I saw that came close. <br /> <br />
