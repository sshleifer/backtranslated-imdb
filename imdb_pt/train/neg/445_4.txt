One thing that surprised me about this movie (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud to be the greatest historian on the subject of Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians who worked on this film, considering how many of the actual events were changed or disregarded. Another critic said that von Trotta said she never wanted Lena to go to bed with Goebbels, but in that case why did she give the impression that this was what happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the liberation of the mens, such as the disaster that was Stalingrad, or the fear of the Nazis that the international press, based in Berlin, discovered about the protest. <br /> <br /> Why was the whole plot the second violin of a weak family bond plot that was done over and over again? Certainly something as incredible as this could carry its own story! In some places, it was as if the movie had two plots that really seemed to have little in common. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie failed in its goal, which was to draw attention to a little known act. of resistance, which is a shame, because done better, could have a great impact.
