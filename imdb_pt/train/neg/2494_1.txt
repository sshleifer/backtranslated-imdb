What a joke. I'm watching on Channel 1 and I think watching dry paint is a lot more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dien that tied him up in this nightmare. Terrible acting, very boring plot and terrible direction. It's so terrible, it's funny. It's supposed to be full of suspense, but it's more of a comedy. If you want to see a terrible performance, script of ridiculous script and insignificant plot, see this movie. If I were Van Dien, I would not just ask my 10% of my agent, but I'd fire the bastard in the process. What a turkey! You are not even fit to be in MST 3K !! It would be a good movie to cure your insomnia. I particularly love the part where Van Dien is thrown overboard and then back in just a few minutes! I can only imagine that this was written by non-syndicalist writers taking advantage of the writer's strike. What a horrible movie !!!
