Demer Daves, is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and "broken arrow" remains in everyone's mind. As for the melodrama, he should leave this to meet people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The script is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while watching a weepie so warm. Natalie Wood's character was inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk), but who could believe she is black? Susan Kohner had more credibility in the "imitation of life") and Sinatra and Curtis get so stereotyped that they can not do anything with them: the poor officer and the rich sergeant and sergeant. Who is Natalie going to fall in love with? France is shown as a land of tolerance, where interracial marriages are most welcome. At the time (around 1944) it was dubious, it is still for narrow minded people that you can find here and everywhere. .
