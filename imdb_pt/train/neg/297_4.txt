For the record, this movie is intriguing, but it is hardly original. In 1998, a film starring Talia Shire called The Landlady had almost the same plot, but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story is that Amanda Lear has had a bad life, abusive father, excited doctor, mental homes, She has finally been released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor ... that she abuses and kills analically the poor boy. (now that it was original) The doctor had financed a mansion for her before killing him and burying the sucker in the yard. After moving, she falls in love with a stallion named Richard, who happens to be married to a blues singer. If you've seen The Landlady you know the rest, she kills or tries to kill anyone who gets in between her and Richard (including a roadie). Much of the idea came from the previous film, the same stupid helper who stuck his nose into it, even spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn, even flying a bodypress. It had some original material, the beer bottle thing was brutal. The highlight of the movie was Amanda's beautiful breasts in the top scene. A bit of a ripoff, but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
