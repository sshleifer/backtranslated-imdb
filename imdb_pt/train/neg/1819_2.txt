I looked for this movie for a reason - Al Adamson. He is among the worst directors of all time - along with Ed Wood Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of horror. However, I was a bit disappointed that although the film was indeed poor, it never approached the horror levels of some of its early films. Because of this, this movie was not particularly fun to watch for us fans of bad movies. <br /> <br /> Now, I was scared to watch this movie, since the title "Awakened" makes the movie sound like a pornographic movie. movie - something I would not be reviewing on IMDb. However, this movie seemed to be this at times - especially in the first 10 minutes. But you could say that the script has undergone many changes, since for most of the film there is no excitement and at the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of a place where it is violent and certainly NOT sexy. ! The result of all this is total confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts is good. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little And it's incomprehensible because they would put a 71-year-old in some of the love scenes. Of course, for a 71 year old Mr. Livingston looked very good - but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him get along with the young nymph! Then, when the final 20 minutes turn violent, Livingston will become a Rambo-like face! Talk about strange and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to worry about and the movie sucks a lot, even with such a crazy title as "Naughty Stewardesses".
