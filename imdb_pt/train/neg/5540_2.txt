After watching the Zombie Revolt, starring future Oscar winner Dean Jagger, I had a burning question. How was a society that created these last fighting machines of defeated warriors in the first place? <br /> <br /> This is the question you will be wondering if you take time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies. At the end of World War I, the French discover a cult of occupied Cambodia where these undead creatures that can not be held with bullets form a brigade of monks that surpass the top and dislodge the Hun. <br /> <br /> It scares the living fecal matter of all involved, so that an international expedition is formed to discover how to destroy the secret of these zombies so that no nation can lay hands on it and dominate the world. <br /> <br /> But we have some disagreement in those ranks. The first is the villain of Snidely Whiplash, Roy D'Arcy, who kills the Buddhist monk who has the secret and the second is Dean Jagger. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he is determined to lure Dorothy Stone away from rival Robert Noland. <br /> <br /> I think you have some idea of ​​how it comes out, especially since a race of zombies conquer the world for a country. Dean Jagger as he won the Oscar for Twelve O'Clock High must have shuddered every time he thought about this movie and the terrible dialogue he tried to give a spark of sincerity. <br /> <br /> Moral of the story, you can become a supreme warrior with the zombie potion and the zombie, but you can not make a definitive love slave.
