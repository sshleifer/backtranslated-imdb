Fair enough, even by Monogram standards, this mystery (a remake of The Sphinx) has an eccentric plot that is not unraveled with much effect - you'll see through it after about ten minutes. The two leaders have a good cheerful dialogue at first, but John Hamilton is hopelessly boring as the villain (Lionel Atwill gave birth to the role) and Warren Hymer's idiot is pretty boring. However, it pays to watch a five-minute appearance of the incomparable Manteland Moreland as Nicodemus, the caretaker, who takes the best on the defense lawyer during a hilarious appearance in court. You have to hand it over to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he was not much of a director, but he always put a routine programmer into some silly vaudeville.
