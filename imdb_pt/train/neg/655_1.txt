I got into it with my hopes, for twenty minutes in the movie I could not have been more disappointed. Though I thought this would be another horribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe ... just maybe someone hit it this time. Unfortunately, Dance Night is at the same quality level as the recent remake of Lies Day, bad script, bad direction, overdone acting and generally bad horror. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, it's boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rollers. We've seen this before and saw it done a million times better than that. If you go to watch Prom Night at the theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh because they'll laugh. The laughs are not at points in the movie that should be funny, they are in response to "thrilling" moments in the movie that are so poorly made that you feel like you are watching the latest version of Scary Movie. Seriously, should this be a remake or parody? The filmmakers missed the point so badly here that a lot of people in the theater I watched came out of the middle of the movie. Which, in retrospect, I would have done. Not me, though, I had to torture myself and keep this up, hoping it would get better. Needless to say, no. The "horror" scenes are a joke, not so much because of the acting, but because of the direction, the script, the "special effects" and the work of the camera. The film can give the impression of spending a fortune to produce it, but still came out with a micro-budget film. I kind of hoped to see the dollar store labels on some of the props and kept thinking I'd find a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /> <br /> This movie is scary, if this is the future of big budget terror, then the horror genre is doomed.
