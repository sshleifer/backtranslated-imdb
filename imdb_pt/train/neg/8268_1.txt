This movie is horrible. Everything was done before. There is nothing original. I can not stand when writers do not invent their own plans. <br /> <br /> A girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up like an adult. Hmm, looks a lot like an '80s movie called Big. What is even more annoying is the performance of Jennifer Garner. She does not act like she's 13, she just acts like she's stupid. <br /> <br /> From then on, you can guess the whole plot. She gets a good job and it turns out that a friend she was at age 13 works with her. Wow, cool! But no ... your friend is bad and turns to her, trying to get her job. But, of course, she wins at the end when a "great" idea comes up. <br /> <br /> There is also a dance scene in the movie that I've seen thousands of times before. <BR> I hate this movie.
