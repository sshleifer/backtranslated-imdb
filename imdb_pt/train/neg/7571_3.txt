Woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) chases the man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) by the father (Charles Winninger as B.J.). The woman wants the man to invest some money from the deceased mother in his father's enterprise; but the father is notorious for losing money on brain scans. Little does anyone know but true villains are posing as man's best friends in order to steal his fortune ... <br /> <br /> Production seems engaging, but the story does not fit. The players do not play well drunk. Remarkable as the first appearance of Broderick Crawford - as gopher "Hunk"; In addition to running errands, Mr. Crawford is pinned to the ground by Mr. McCrea. <br /> <br /> Woman Chases Man (28/4/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
