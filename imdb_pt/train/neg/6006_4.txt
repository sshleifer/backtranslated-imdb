I did not agree with any of the theories in the Left Behind series, but I still found the books exciting and read 8 of 12 of them. Undeniably good writing and interesting history. However, I do not have very high expectations for the movie. There was no way Hollywood could accept a Christian series and produce a big-budget movie. So it was done independently ... and it seemed like I was watching a really long TV program. It simply did not feel like a movie; did not have that movie "experience" if anyone knows what I'm talking about. So the movie suffered because of it, and the poor special effects and low budget were another detriment to me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I feel that Gordon Currie was miserably happy as Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he should be this charming, gorgeous, incredibly handsome guy who spoke English with almost zero traces of accent. Then I pictured someone like Pierce Brosnan on paper. Instead, they found a Clay Aiken clay pencil that looks like a Best Buy employee of the month, and gave him a very bad fake accent. So, that lost some stars for me right there. A movie is not convincing when the main villain does not look or sound like it should. <br /> <br /> The performance was good, but nothing to write home about. Some of the scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (I can not remember which one) - were real squirmers for me. And part of Christian rock or whatever, it was really out of place for some of the scenes, like Kirk Cameron's praying in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, it was not a bad movie, but he just did not do it for me. Keep the book, guys, it's so much better.
