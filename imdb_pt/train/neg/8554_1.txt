The film was most likely made in the year 1930 and released in 1931. I suppose that moving movie pictures have great difficulty in making the transition from the age of silence. However, this particular plot of Zane Gray seems to be very weak. Also, Gary Cooper was probably learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, it is not acceptable. Some of the actors performed well. Unfortunately, the Indians always get the short end in these early westerns. They were living on earth long before the white man arrived, but according to the distorted history, they had no right to defend themselves.
