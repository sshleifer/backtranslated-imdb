Who likes "horrible comedy" shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two types of people I can think of who attend this are: One, Muslim and self-proclaimed liberal advocates of all ethnic groups who are so thrilled that there is a program about Muslims that does not even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). Two, elderly people and people whose idea of ​​comedy is unbelievably predictable, poorly written, obsolete jokes. <br /> <br /> CBC really needs to take a look at what it's doing and who its audience is. If they continue to write comedy just for really old people, then guess what will happen, the audience will die soon and they will not have more audience. Would I be curious for who still writes for this show? Do you think they are actually funny Muslims or young people? No, I bet it's white and old guys who write the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the '60s. When you look at CBC comedy shows, Air Farce (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer we're paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for the comedy "Little Mosque on the Prairie. Is it supposed to be offencive and funny? Only CBC would think this stupid show is offensive or funny at all. Shame on the CBC to waste our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching.
