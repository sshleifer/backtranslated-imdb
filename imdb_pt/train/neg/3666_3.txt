This is a very confusing movie. The film is very difficult to follow and the plot did not seem to make any sense. Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when any movie is dubbed from one language to another, it does not translate exactly as it was meant first. Maybe that's part of the problem, but I doubt it can explain all the problems with this movie. The dubbing is very bad and the voices do not match very well with the characters. The scenes are hectic, there are a number of strange and irrelevant characters who do little more than confuse the viewer even more. What I liked about this movie was the look of the werewolf himself and the scenes in which he attacks. Now, if you could put it all together and make some sense, maybe you had something. Do not waste your time on this.
