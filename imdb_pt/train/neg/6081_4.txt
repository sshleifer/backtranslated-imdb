A typical Italian film of the 70's, original and good music, but with some quirks, interesting but not fantastic photography, poor and sometimes confusing plot (eg role of werewolf, and where does the boy come from?) with a poor dialogue, a pleasant environment. <br /> <br /> The reason it is still (relatively) well-known and sought after is probably the nude scenes (including the typical pseudo-coitus of the 70s) involving an 11- and 13-year-old girl. with an older teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - is interesting from the sociopolitical point of view to see how these representations of very young adolescents were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the USA) 30 years ago, while now it is more than a taboo. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a girl's bullying (Laura) for the other two characters, and her discovery of sex, a fairly accurate representation of one aspect of teenage life. Eva's character (Silvia) does not evolve until the end of the film and already appears very versed in the erotic arts - there is no "ripening" for her: she is a vain young woman who already knows her sexual charms but ultimately is only used and ends the movie crying like the girl she really still is. The boy is a totally despicable bully, while Laura is a naive and weak victim.
