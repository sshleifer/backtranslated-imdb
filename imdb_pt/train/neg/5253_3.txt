The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "Woman". I do not know if this was intentional or not, but certainly had some German audience laughter at the Fantasy Film Festival last year when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But those were the only laughs movie has. Not that he was looking at laughter, it's a horrible movie for God's sake! A horrible movie in more than one meaning. It's a pity that such a premise was wasted with horrible unbearable moments for the viewer (definitely not for the faint of heart!)! And it was not necessary to show all the things that are shown. I am not even entering into a moral obligation (because movies do not really have that kind of task or function) discussion about what is shown here, but this is a new low in the "torture movement" that has grown in the last few years!
