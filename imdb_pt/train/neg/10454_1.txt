when we discussed a movie titled "snake in an airplane", we should point out early that snakes are very important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here are very bad, cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes. snakes are scary because they look slimy, they crawl, they slip. these snakes do nothing of the kind. they slide like they would in a video game. They are cartoon snakes. I would say that even someone who had a big phobia against real snakes would not find these things scary. Why on earth would you want to include extreme closes of these cgi failures? why not rely on suspense .. all ethics "less is more". or better yet, why not just make them look good in the first place? and then maybe still use them in moderation <br /> <br /> take a look at john carpenters 'the thing'. here we have real mud and a number of sinister proportions. 20 years pass by and we get that stack of fucking sfx shit "snakes in a plane". When will these people wake up and smell the coffee? special effects are going back! <br /> <br /> Sure you could say .. but the movie is a joke, got it? Of course I have that idea, but do it well! In addition to the above, this movie has a crappy dialogue. and the music and sound effects are not scary or memorable. <br /> <br /> I could handle all the other actors that are part of this movie except for jackson. What was he doing there? the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago. this career progression? Are you offering people value for money? do not. I wonder what Tarantino thought when he was halfway through the movie. <br /> <br /> The current generation seems to have very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to be offering them exactly what they want. on leaving the movie theater I saw a series of advertisements for some really horrific future releases, including ... DOA: dead or alive, (another) cgi animal film called 'released', and another crap looking at the comedy called 'click'. Also, I saw some horrible trailers, including one for (another) crap horror / British comedy. I have not really seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time. <br /> <br /> I hope to see this movie on sale in the DVD bargaining section for Â£ 1 in 6 months. and if you're hoping to see a black comedy with tons of big snakes, and some cool and bad dialogs from the lips of samuel l jacksons. forget.
