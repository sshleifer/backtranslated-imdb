This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you understand me. The stories are so far removed from the Robin Hood legend that it is incredible. It seems they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It might very well have been called Mr. Bland's New Adventures. <br /> <br /> Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, I would love this program. This is a horrible approach to a TV series. Such visual media should awaken your imagination, you should not have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the episode of the Simpsons, where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda film, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. "If a movie is boring, I just make my own story." <br /> <br /> In conclusion: absolute human waste.
