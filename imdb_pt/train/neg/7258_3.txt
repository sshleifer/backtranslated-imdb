This granulated film has a cult of followers and one of those word-of-mouth features you had to see. It may be hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas, Fouke, who knows the legend is true. This tale is told in documentary style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in real locations talking to real people involved. The legend changes with the narrative, but during the late 60's and most of the 70's the surrounding area of ​​Fouke was visited by a large foot-like creature who traveled along the marshy brook. Long with three toes and over 7 feet tall, this hirsute creature periodically damaged and frightened the bejeebers of most of the community. I personally crossed the small bridge of Boggy Creek in 1974, but rather the hair on the back of my neck rose. Of course it was about one o'clock in the morning in the rain. When I got to Shreveport, I was laughing.
