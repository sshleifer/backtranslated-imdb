I just saw this movie on Flix after recording it with timer. I grew up watching F Troop and had a hard time getting Jane Wrangler, so I was shocked, literally shocked, to discover, after seeing this movie, that the degenerate homicidal nurse was Melody Patterson, who looks very good but also looks completely different and unfortunately bad photographed. I never would have guessed it was her in a million years. What the hell is she doing in a picture like that? I agree with the guys here that the movie does not have what it's pushing. No sex, no blood, no provocation. It's also a remake of Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or so). Most of the action is tedious; the main character spends huge amounts of time running around the house of the crazed doctor and the basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being beaten by the police, all this boring and full of time. Now, if the Italians had done it, half the movie would have been the Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam henchman caressing the unconscious naked girls. But you only get this for 20 seconds.
