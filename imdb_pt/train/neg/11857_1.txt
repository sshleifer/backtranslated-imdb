Worst movie of all time !!! Please see the real movie reviews of the pros in this movie. Check Rotten Tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews about this movie. The comments made on this site are apparently from people with some financial interest in this movie. I find the positive comments very deceptive. I find it amazing how negative the comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an Oscar speech. Do not waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie is retarded !! I do not believe a movie like this would be made. Why would Hollywood waste its time with this garbage? This movie is an attempt at nothing. I wonder what looser really would sink your money by producing such garbage. I went to the blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money. I did not listen and I wasted my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really the "worst movie ever made!"
