The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent so I decided to take a look. BAD IDEA! This is another movie about a ghost of revenge against a group of friends. The story is stupid, mix two parts Ringu with one part Prom Night, a dash of I know what you did last summer, and add a little pinch of Single White Female - now mix until you are completely pointless. There is nothing new about this plot, and revisiting the cliches I so fondly liked was not even fun this time around. This movie goes back and forth and once I made sense, I realized that it still did not make much sense. The characters range from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye. Speaking of characters, they are all their stereotypical favorites - greedy selfish lawyer, egocentric actress, baseball star, video voyeur, bitter girl, calm and scary girl, coolest chick than cool damn black cat ... and I did not care about any of them. Maybe a better writer could have made the film work, there were some decent scenes, but overall this movie was a mess. I should also mention a certain 'video tape' that would be IMPOSSIBLE to film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the worst that Asian terror has to offer, but it is still very bad. If you just want to see some scary pictures in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud with some exaggerated acting, or just want to scream "you're stupid!" on a movie screen, or just want to have another Asian horror movie up its sleeve when someone asks how many you've seen - this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> Those who seek a decent plot seek elsewhere.
