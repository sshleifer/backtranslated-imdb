I am a big brand for Neil Young's music, and with that and the brilliant compliments the film has received in many alternative indie press circles, they hit Greendale's first showing that I could find. My excitement was short-lived, as this turgid plot and the weak lyrical impetus left most viewers asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says the movie started as a soundtrack, and the characters came alive so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to create a story. No character actually has a bow, and when "significant" events happen, the viewer does not care because the annoying levels of the film technique are so high by that point. The movie is all kind of music, and to that end, the characters end the lyrics while they are sung ... the technique works for the first stanza that is made, and it is irritating the nerves after that. It does not look real or fake, it just seems undesirable. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, with characters finding a humor and touching it all. Poor lighting sometimes. The only compliments I can give to the film are in relation to several scenes filmed as news, but the technique is so used in the cinema today that this film did little to promote it. A good soundtrack, but nothing I'm quick to buy. A bad movie.
