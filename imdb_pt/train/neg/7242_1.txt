The Pallbearer is a disappointment and sometimes extremely annoying with a love story that simply does not work in part with the cast of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the film with a confused look on his face and it's hard to tell what David Schwimmer even sees in her. <br /> <br /> However, the Staff of Palor is sometimes funny, especially the church scene and the group scenes. with your friends are a laugh, but that's basically it. Watch The Pallbearer for those scenes only and quickly advance the rest. Trust me, you're not losing too much.
