Same. Has a week passed that Oprah does not remind us that she was abused as a child? <br /> <br /> It becomes the focus of every interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah can not resist commenting on the subject. answer any questions she may have. She often interrupts the guests before an answer is finished to interrupt her own remark or anecdote. It is obvious that the directors are instructed to focus on their reaction rather than the faces of the guests, because that is what counts - what Oprah feels, what Oprah says. <br /> Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always all about Oprah. <br /> Oprah says - I'm sorry for me, I was so poor. Feel the pain of my battle with my weight. Feel my hurt when I walk away from a fancy store after I've already closed it. Feel good about buying my magazines and books. Feel good about my success. Feel good when you give my charity to make me look good. Feel good about becoming rich beyond belief. <br /> <br /> My interpretation from her point of view: YOU VISITORS ARE SO DEEPENLY FOUNDED AND YOU NEED MY DAILY BOARD. I have all the answers to your life, although I have nothing in common with you, commoners. I've never been married nor do I want to be. I never had to raise a family - but I know all about it. I have little respect for men or for marriage. I clearly prefer people like me over others - witness "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend, but we're not gay. As of 7/31/2006, the title on their site actually said: "Oprah.com is your main source of information on love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health ". How presumptuous and disagreeable is that? <br /> <br /> In June of 2006, she hit two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to gather images for her September 2006 gigs. She continues to promise to leave the TV, but her yapfest drags endlessly in view. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor a personal mission of God. She's just a very lucky, overweight black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called it her own. She happened to be in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck the right demographic. <br /> <br /> Oprah is the P.T. Barnum of that age and it surprises me that people can not see through its facade. <br /> <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you too Oprah if you can fit that inflated ego through the door - this way now for the big egress ...
