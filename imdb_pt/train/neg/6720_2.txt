Now here is a movie that if done in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Sadly and annoyingly, here he is, flaccid and tacky and drenched in the land of Lala. How did the tab get so wrong? Well, mostly for being serious about such a hilariously surprising job that no one in their right mind could take seriously. Unless, of course, they were a nerdy gay cliché and lonely (but somehow cute) ... or it's that cliché piled on the cliché. No value in the story that almost looks like a prequel to GERRY by Gus Van Sant ..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how's all this a lead weight? Well, this author must have gotten so crazy that he failed to get Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own. Convolute and underdeveloped, plus the theme 'unrequited love is boring' left over from a faded Streisand letter, we have only a melancholy plot and a serial level plot of TV. The fourth unnecessary act of this turgid, exaggerated drama is truly appalling as the film moves away like the Gerries into the wilderness and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 1990s, about 20 people made a similar but really hilarious movie called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY, also suffered from a more horrible author than Orson, so they re-filmed half of it, got a relentless TV editor to cut it for 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight ! A lesson from when bad movies look good brightening up. I think the FLUFFER stiffed at launch and after seeing it not run, I can understand why.
