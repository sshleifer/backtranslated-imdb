This movie deserves another bad review. Consider a critic extolling the virtues of the film that include "no sex, violence or violence." Excuse me. The very set-up of the film makes us watch as Cody's young companion, with love for life and who has everything to live, is blown to pieces, leaving Cody holding his body lifeless and blood. And, given the nature of the war, we know that Cody saw horror almost daily. So much for those who watch this movie with such glasses of roses that the violence that defines Cody's personality is erased from the viewer's memory. <br /> <br /> Without his own family Cody, like John Rambo, wanders the country on his bike making the long journey to hometown USA under the guise of a place called Nevada City. No mention, no realization of the clear fact that Cody is damaged. We know that since his CO pretty much declares it, just as he ordered Cody to "rest a little" from the death and destruction of the war. That explains, as no one seems to notice or mind, the obvious "flat" effect of Cody. It's not bad acting. It is the flat effect of posttraumatic stress disorder. Not guessing here, remember that your commander ordered him to leave the battlefield. <br /> <br /> How about that "accidental" kiss, as noted by another reviewer? The fall was an accident, the kiss was not. How exactly was Cody "respecting" Faith, thinking she knew full well that she was spoken? Now this was a moment of unfamiliar value. A moment that is then announced to the immediate universe, as if posted on YouTube. Of course, faith's lapse of faith, as well as Cody's "coming" to a woman who plans to marry another, is greeted in the spirit of the Christmas season, all CHIEURING their hearts and lips. <br /> <br /> He knows little about Faith's fianc√©, except that she professes his love for him, she takes no more than a nano second to accept his proposal (he could have waited for ulterior motives), he is generous, he loves her to death, the family has nothing really against him, he believes that marriage is based on commitments and the two have never discussed post-marriage plans. There are no evildoers here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a great actor who talks about mountain dialogue like 'we love you, son ...' 'You are part of our family' literally days after they met a stranger named Cody. And the 'band of brothers' speech where the phrase was most of all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This film is cotton candy that gets betrayed in important ways. The crassest is when he applauds Cody's disrespect for Faith by beating physically in his knowledge that she is well known. By redefining the family as we know it: accepting a virtual stranger as a full-fledged loving member of the family because we all "love you." How many of you have done this or do you know someone who did it? DO NOT.
