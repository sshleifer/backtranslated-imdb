This is a film that shows that humor, music and texture are not enough to make a good movie. Of course, the viewer is treated to numerous scenes from Los Angeles in the 1930s - I especially liked the view of the tram approaching the tunnel, and the tram going up the slope - but in a sense, this good cinematography is self-destructive. , because it creates a climate that "something will happen" - and nothing happens. The script also holds sway toward some plot, action or trauma - and, time after time, does not deliver. Not even delivering the (I suppose) theme of the film, the essential mismatch of the characters. The main actors, both very handsome for their roles, did not transmit any repression or agony, and the script did not expose us to any. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? That's another story. His character was so well done, so perfectly touched, that I wanted the camera to follow.
