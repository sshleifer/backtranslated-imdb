What made the French Connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe led by Frankenheimer (who also brought us such jewels as Raindeer Games and Dr. Moreau Island) the film focuses on Doyle and his unique obsession with capturing Charnier (King). The fictional idea that the New York Police Department would allow Doyle to travel to Marseille to find Charnier with the help of the local French authorities is a funny laugh. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Charnier did not jump the city with 65 pounds of pure kiss !!! A street worth of 32 million, but rather, we will send Doyle to find this guy, it was his grip after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible (with the only exception of Hackman, who completely exaggerated on his part). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts between the scenes were terrible. Do yourself a favor and watch the first installment twice and skip this one.
