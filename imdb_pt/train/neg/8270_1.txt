Non-existent plot, tons of misdirected / super cheesy scenes (snipers / famous snipers of the world who can not even hit their targets just a few feet away? More what's up with the end? ---> a lot of police vandalizing a (how many bullets can you fit into a glock magazine? 100+? These people fire their guns without the need to recharge). The film is so bad that even a Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) can not save this crap. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie (I realized that I lost a good 100 minutes of my movie). precious life in this one). I hope the director stops making films or learns more about his next film.
