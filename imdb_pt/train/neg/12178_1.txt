Annie's wig does not look good. she is not pretty and beautiful enough to play Annie. Annie stands out in the film, as her clothes look like Halloween costumes. terrible acting and terrible conspiracies. This movie is a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger, younger girl should have the lead role. Ashley Johnson plays a very childish Annie. Not attractive at all. At least the casting director was right with Daddy Warbucks. Mrs. Hannigan was also miscast. Camilla Belle played well with Molly. "Caution" this movie may insult your IQ, so you may just want to show it to very young children. 8 and younger. Some of the plots are very fictitious and could hardly occur in the real world.
