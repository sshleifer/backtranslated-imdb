As I am not a fan of blood and courage, I find the bloody scenes totally unnecessary (you spell it) and too real for my taste, whether you are the kind of person who takes the stones on the beheadings on the internet or snuff films that I mean, go ahead, it's hard to believe what kind of person dreams about this sickly crap. <br /> <br /> In addition, it had the potential to be a great movie, the music was also first class (through the film and especially the final credits). Some parts, however, were a bit unbelievable, as you have just been found by your girlfriend, waiting for torture and death and all you do is tell what happened and how you got there (why did not he ask if she happened to have a few wipes or even a little freshner air or a piece of bubble gum while he was at it?), come on now, most probably just scream "hurry up and untie me, then let's take away from ** * from here FAST! ". where were the flies, larvae, etc., and when the girl accidentally came through the place, surely the smell of rotten meat would have sounded some alarms! I would only recommend this film to friends of Dennis Niellson and the like, I'm sure a video like this would make sick people have a very happy Christmas.
