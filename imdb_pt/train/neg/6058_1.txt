A plot that failed and smelled of irreconcilable differences in opinion constituted a ruin of judgment with one pro-life side and the other a destroyer of the seed of a demon. The horror was left out and replaced by a bland general effect, possibly destined to be horrible, but instead showed a poor dose of beliefs that ridiculed one another to death, despite the title itself. Being a Masters of Horror fan from the start, this ridiculous turnaround with her sordid depictions shed like an old rocking chair after being seated. I see this episode as being thrown by the get go, never really taking off anywhere else than to see through it's worth and relieved when it finally came to "The End" ..
