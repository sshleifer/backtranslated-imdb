I've always liked Fred MacMurray and although his career has been tragically disrupted, I think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Bring together these two great and engaging stars, add top supporting names like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, team with the renowned director Mitchell Leisen and you will have a mediocre movie experience. Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "find themselves cute" during their visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpet player, so he embarks on a musical career, which is predictably meteoric in its rise and fall. During his rise to musical stardom, he neglects Maggie, who later inspires him to start over after he reaches the bottom of the pit. Ah, yes, it's the true happy ending of Hollywood, which arrives too soon. <br /> <br /> Stars and a director of that caliber should ensure success, but this film is so predictable and slow that it is difficult. to watch sometimes. The first scenes in Panama are so drawn that they seem to last forever, and later an alcoholic Skid simply wanders around in New York. Fred and Carole try their best, but the tired script and the S-L-O-W direction just do not give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, simply does not seem true. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen once to watch some of the first performances of the MacMurray and Lombard stars. However, I guarantee that the observation will take about 48 hours.
