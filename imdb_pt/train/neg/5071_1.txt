I can not even believe this show lasted as long as it did. I think it's all part of the dumbness of America. Personally, as David Spade said, I enjoyed this show better when it went through its original title - "Seinfeld." What bothers me most about this program, apart from the obvious and basic sense of humor, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled. Truly great shows are still funny after many repeated views, such as "the one where Rob is accidentally hypnotized," the "Dick Van Dyke Show," or "the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory." In other words, it's an honor given to great shows by viewers. That the writers and producers of "Friends" would have the absolute arrogance of actually titling the episodes, themselves, in such a way, even before anyone has a chance to see it for the second time, speaks not only about mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of the said writers, but also of the stultified minds of their spectators. <br /> <br /> You have read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland, full of the feeling of the card. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people should be working in cafes and looking for work as actors, but somehow they can live on $ 4,000 / month. apartments Be real. All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with their Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all that. That New York does not exist for someone who earns less than a serious six-figure income. But, good luck with all that, anyway. Now, shut up and pass the Soma.
