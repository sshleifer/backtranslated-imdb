I'm soooo glad I did not spend money to go to the movies :-). It is nothing more than the compilation of elements of some other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc., framed in a bland and meaningless scene. I really can not figure out what the purpose of creating this movie was - he has absolutely nothing new to offer in his plot which is also foolish. Plus, there's nothing to watch - the FX's seem to have been taken from a second-hand store, you've usually seen them all in other movies. But it's definitely a good lullaby.
