Boring. Minimum installment. No character development I entered this movie with high expectations of the book. It could have been an incredible movie. It could have become a cult classic. No, it was a giant disappointment. It was badly fused and had horrible special effects. It was difficult to determine who the bandits were: the rebels or the military, the church or all of them? I'm still puzzled by certain mini-plots in the movie. I am perplexed about certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy," which is never fully explained. I felt like I was watching a tacky episode of a miniseries on the science fiction channel. It looked a lot like a movie made for TV. Do not go see this movie. It is a waste of time and money.
