The town girl, Meg Tilly, receives a terrifying phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns home to the rural digs of her family, only to come across a mystery: why all the residents are agitated bizarre and disturbing ? Radiation thrillers, with only a nod to ecology, have locals going crazy, which (ridiculously) includes two women staring at each other with longing in a public place and Tim Matheson getting oral attention from a girl on a bench office. The image is too silly for words, wasting Tilly's melancholy and silent intensity on the trash, as she forced herself into a corner from which she could not hope to leave. Part of Thomas Del Ruth's cinematography is good (particularly a fire sequence inside a garage), although he is disappointed by the fragmented editing - and a rather endless end. Simplistic script has neither a surprise nor a bit of originality in the manga. * 1/2 of ****
