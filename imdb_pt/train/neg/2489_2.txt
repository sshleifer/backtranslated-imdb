STAR CLASSIFICATION: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Evening * Monday Morning McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name becomes a synonym for character in The Simpsons) is a (typically) unorthodox police officer who gets results, but wraps his superiors into something rotten. Avoiding his partner's clich√© being killed at the beginning of the movie, the plot takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico, where a secret American super tank with incredible firepower and images was smuggled, just to be taken hostage , along with the crew, by a gang of terrorists. This boring, cheap action movie (even in the 80's) was a bizarre career change for Gary Busey, after impressing the villain of blazing haired Mr Joshua in Lethal Weapon. He just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here, nervous and crazy as ever (with 'butthorn' being his trademark placed on the bad guys) but without the material to support him. Henry Silva has presence as a villain but he is totally a miscast here as an Arab leader (in a red beret!) And the horrible script gives him some really awkward lines of annoying dialogues that make his performance laughably ridiculous. He is just one of many action movie actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who appear but can not add anything to the mix. After a first part without much action, things increase a bit in the end, but it's a little too late and neither of them can be fun. *
