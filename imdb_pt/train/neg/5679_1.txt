I was so disturbed by the actual filming at the beginning of the film that I felt sick to my stomach and ended up closing the film. As anyone can give this film more than a rating of 1 confuses me. I know the intent of the movie is to shock but show real pictures of a dog that was skinned alive (holding the vomit while typing) - PLEASE! I turn off after the scene with the baby decomposing. I had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point. It is no wonder that this movie has been found in the box of HMV business. I really do not feel like seeing any other movie from that Uwe person. Whoever likes this needs therapy. Period.
