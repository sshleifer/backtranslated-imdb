The last couple of weeks in the life of a dead slut woman is told in flashbacks. Like the tramp, the movie wanders aimlessly and without much purpose. Mona, the lazy title character, grumpy and addicted to drugs, is not nice and Bonnaire does little to make her interesting. While there is some pretentious dialogue trying to explain why Mona chose this miserable lifestyle, her motives are never really clear. The episodic nature of the movie, involving some random characters, becomes tiring after a while, making it look much larger than the runtime. It is also hard to believe that an attractive homeless young woman attracts more attention from men.
