It was an agonizingly bad movie. He will eat your heart while you watch. I beg you: do not watch this movie! You'll hate it losing 1.5 hours of your life! It's not like some movies that are so bad that you can watch and enjoy ... this movie sucks like ... there is nothing as annoying as this movie. You will hate yourself after watching this movie until the end. And you're going to hate yourself for not listening. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and watched this movie until the end. Now I'm sorry, I'm going to shoot myself. I saw everything. <br /> <br /> Please. Read this very carefully. Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
