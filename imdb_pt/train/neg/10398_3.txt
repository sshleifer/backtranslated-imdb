There is nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very bad. The acting is horrible, the script terrible; and overrated special effects. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat your audience with such contempt? And why did they make a sequel?
