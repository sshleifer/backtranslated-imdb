Out of shame, out of shame that a good actor like Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this nauseating play. The film was not only bad but down right horrible and no redeeming quality. The plot, (was there a?) It seemed to go where. The Russians played dead or dead games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void by their pathetic performances. I gave up about 3/4 of the way and hung up. A "1" to horrible just because there is nothing minor. Do not waste your time with this, you will not miss a thing.
