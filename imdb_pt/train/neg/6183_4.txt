In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as President of the United States; North Korea announced the possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened that year, but the movie itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. Now in 2009, the film The United States has another president, there is another pope, new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but it is the same as say: "getting your fingers cut is better than cutting your head". This sequel is a really bad movie that left me tremendously bored and disinterested. The cast of Into the Blue 2: The Reef is comprised of TV series actors who lack any credibility and dramaticity. but they are perfect for showing off their bodies. Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Aliases), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring empty, boring performances. I like some previous films by director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil's excellent Ted adventure, but in this movie he can not even generate the minimum level of tension, emotion or entertainment.The characters in this film are not only badly executed, but it is also repulsive.Honestly, I wanted them all The cinematography of this film is also lame and seems to have been made by a technical team that makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.In Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible movie that is better than the original movie, but that's the same as nothing, as I said earlier. Avoid this low-quality movie at all costs.
