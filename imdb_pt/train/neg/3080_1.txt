Hee hee. This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it is a big problem. I remember the day I first saw this on the MST. The sun was shining, it seemed like a good day. So I saw this Rick Sloane product, which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc on the land of the '80s. Kevin, extraordinary, tries to impress his girlfriend, runs a security assistant job, fights with rakes, and much more in that series of sloppy images. No plot or story is needed. Obviously, no acting is necessary, as the movie proves. An army guy and his sex-crazy girl will make you want to jump off a cliff, and the idiot friend who kicks the phone will make you say, "He's got some cool red shorts." Also, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his grocery cart. When you think it's over, wait until the Scum Club scene. Ask for Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I advise that after watching this movie, a good month to regain sense and sanity. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick in the crotch to show how much we appreciate this piece called Hobgoblins.
