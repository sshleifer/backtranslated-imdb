What a shame for the films of Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and provided a steady dose of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap that is not even worth the You Tube standards. I was grinding my teeth throughout the film beginning to end with the schizophrenic direction, plot that never materialized and in the last scene I felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati filmmakers can "THROW AWAY" crores in such stupidity. It's a shame for the actors to take that job and even comment on it as a job they can take on. Saif Ali Khan - completely dissapointed with his choice of movie. Kareen shows enough skin for puberty and Akshay emerges as the dark. Anil another retarded with a pubescent fascination for English. His comrades were praiseworthy in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered over the last 15 minutes, it was enough to burst a blood vessel. DO NOT USE CEREBRAL CELLS, ENERGY AND YOUR MONEY TO KNOW THAT - Go SEE / Rent AMU - with Konkana Sensharma, instead - a beautiful piece of independent film that has already left India.Intelligent, poignant and a wonderful fairy tale that goes touching everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that not everything is lost in Indian cinema.
