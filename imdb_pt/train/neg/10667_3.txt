Do not be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just glorified extras. His scenes were probably filmed in a day or more. Whatever your reasons for being in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, you'd better make good use of it. To me this is a sign of bad direction. The plot itself was not so bad. And the performance of most of the actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr. however was terrible. He was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this was conceived as a serious movie that can not be a good thing. The action scenes were not bad, but it lacked that special punch to make it more exciting. Again better direction was needed. Also the pace was wrong for a movie like this. The main character took almost half an hour to get into action. For an action thriller of only 90 minutes, that is very slow. The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon. She does her best to make everything work. Too bad the director left her hanged. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is very inexperienced as a director to achieve this. And for an action / stunt coordinator of your caliber, you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes. Do not waste your time on this one. Avoid!
