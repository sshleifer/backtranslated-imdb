Few movies have left me with so much uneasiness, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (As it turned out there I can only imagine) I was subjected to 90 million heinous, derivative garbage, the main impression is a bit like that other sickly film "Do not answer the phone" - but worse. The evil of everything, rape and everything, is shown without any distance (as opposed to strong things like "Last house on the left") and total contempt for the victims (perfect?) And all involved, letting the viewer be treated as a voyeur sadistic In the end, I felt like taking a shower. No credit for the director
