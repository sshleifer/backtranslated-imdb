When this movie was released, it spawned one of the movie capsule reviews of all time: Sphinx Stinks. It does, but in a hypnotizing way. The cast is silly, starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? There is not enough makeup in Cairo for this, at least not while the film was being made. But it's fun to watch them try. The performances range from the mummy (sorry, obvious observation) to the over-the-top, with very few stops in between. The character Lesley-Anne Down looks like she could not find Egypt on a map, much less expose her archaeological treasures. This is due, at least in part, to a really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited on all the viewers of this film. It is my opinion that films that involve a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric, such as Egyptology, are ready for silly and overwritten dialogues. It does not disappoint, and convergence proves a double blow. The plot has a dramatic source of tension: can this be dumber and less credible? The answer is usually yes. The site outlets are beautiful and the design of the set is generally very good, the only consistent reminder that this was not a low budget production. That is the fact that there are so many known faces doing service in an unintentional laugh. Cheap, no; Cheese, yes.
