Flock is not really a movie. It's a wannabe movie, with aspiring actors. Not including Richard Gere, he did an excellent performance, but when only one actor really delivers on his character, and the rest of the cast is just acting ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to hide the fact that you're acting. What the hell was Claire Dains doing in that ?! She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film she looked extremely out of place, out of all of it !! The only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions, like "do you really think that?" And making faces. I was embarrassed by her acting, seriously, and I liked her ... She's the kind of romantic movie, I do not know who picked her among all the actresses out there .... LOL, and seeing Avril Lavigne ?! This really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to have the feeling of vomiting, this movie will do the job for you !!! I wish I could vote -5 ..
