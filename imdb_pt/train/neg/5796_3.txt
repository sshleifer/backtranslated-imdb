I saw this feature as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and was horrified by the sado-masochistic child pornography I witnessed. The story line is hidden in too many graphic sex scenes - and neither of them is even erotic - the sick is more the feeling. The director seemed to be going for the shock value, instead of exploring the various levels of why these characters are like that. See if you can handle it - I still have flashbacks.
