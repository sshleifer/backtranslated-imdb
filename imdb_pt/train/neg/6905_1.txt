Polynesian clich√© men drink, fight, and make a stream of sexist, stupid and bland comments. Real-life Polynesians are a lot funnier than these stereotyped cardboard characters. The supposedly Samoan girl did not look or represent Samoan, more like the white woman who has sex with someone on a whim. With weak story lines like water, you can not say anything about acting - even the brightest actors could not do anything with this script. It's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play stereotypes so sad in a movie with not a good scene, and only two or three "jokes". What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers' money, what a missed opportunity to make a great movie about a vibrant community. It's best not to make movies if they are as bad and stupid as that.
