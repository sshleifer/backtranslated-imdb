What is interesting is that acting; It was not bad, just not enough. It was pretty lame, special effects nor the lines were the only one blamed for this failure. Standing alone, they were not terribly bad, but together it was a tragic movement. The show seemed long and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed up the film, but it totally failed. <br /> <br /> Much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects. they were kind of cool. Appleby was not the best choice for this venture. Although she may have been all they had to choose with a bit of fan recognition. An experienced actress would have brought something to the role, as Appleby never did. Scfi puts some really good original movies, it's too bad that it fails so dramatically.
