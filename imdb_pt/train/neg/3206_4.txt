I was excited to learn that Cesar Montano had decided to make a film in the Cebuano language. (Not 'dialect' as most Filipinos will incorrectly refer to him as.) As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are to each other.) But I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. Being a Canadian, from Cebuano parents, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this movie. I was even more excited to learn that it was not another silly action movie or melodrama, because Filipinos love this kind of movie. But unfortunately, I was grumpy. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy serves as an ego trip for Cesar Montano. Montano, of course, plays the hero of the film. And when I say "hero," I mean the most stereotyped manners; Its function is to win the heart of a girl and to take the Bol-anons to the victory against the Japanese. Your character has no depth or complexity. It only fits into the hero's mold. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional; they all fit into your cookie cutter roles. <br /> <br /> I'm all for slow and meditative movies, but this movie was just slow. He did not really meditate on anything. Just because a film is historically thematic, a drama and slow-moving does not make it a well-made movie. <br /> <br /> Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry, he should have really thought about it. He said he wanted to make films in Visayan that could compete in Cannes and Toronto etc. But in fact, this movie would have been booed and harassed at such festivals. To put the Visayan films in the dominant consciousness, he should at least have made a film that would have attracted audiences, even if it meant sacrificing quality. Obviously, he did not think or get information on what kind of film would be awarded in Cannes, so a movie that attracted public would have been at least one foot in the door. <br /> <br /> I'm scared now. The visayan movies will not be made for long again because of this movie. If I ever told a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan films, of course I would have an answer like: "Visayans do not make good movies. Have not you seen Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Of course this is ridiculous, as it is an example of a Visayan film and probably the only example that anyone today would probably see. <br /> <br /> An example of movies that are meditative, not just slow, are David Lynch's Tagalog, Blackout, or The Straight Story. I hate to promote the Tagalog language as it is infinitely and unjustly promoted and pushed through the throats of non-Tagalog Filipinos, but because of calling a sword spade, I say Blackout is a VERY good movie. These films depend heavily on what Hitchcock called "pure cinema." Images without words are used to convey the story. But I skew the definition a bit for these two films, as these films use wordless images to convey the mood of the movie. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take pictures of the landscape, then they set the mood. <br /> <br /> And what about so many Filipino movies showing a dying mother or grandmother ???
