I totally agree with the last commentator that this could be the worst movie ever made. I also had to get through most of this movie. Michael Madsen must have made this movie as a favor to someone. Image quality is grainy all the time. And the little plot that exists, is just stupid. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if I could give a lower score I would do. Do not waste your time with this movie or you'll be sorry.
