Oh god, what a horrible and horrible movie. It meant being a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst on the reality show. The interstitials presented by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most unpleasant part, written in a tone that is perhaps thoughtful and insightful. Instead, these moments are mind-numbing when they talk to the camera with dialogues written by someone with a love for insulting and condescending speech that pushes the "meaning" of the film down the throat of the viewer. <br /> <br /> a point for possible filmmakers: long, quiet scenes are not the same as art. Neither the extreme angles nor the logic stretched to the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> If anyone is interested in watching this movie, please do not do this. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
