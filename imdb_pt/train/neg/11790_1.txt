Deep SH .. is more like that! Eels are only caricatured throughout the film. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very tacky. <br /> <br /> No development of character or relationship. So called "romantic" scenes very cheesy and predictable. An interesting idea, but a poorly written screenplay and LOUSY special effects make this a definite must-miss!
