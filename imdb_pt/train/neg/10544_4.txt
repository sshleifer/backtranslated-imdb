When childhood memory tells you that this was a scary movie; is touch and go if you must revisit it. Anyway, I remembered a scary scene involving a homeless man and a cool villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good movie, sad to say. It's filled with these clich√©d cops and a really bad script with holes that a truck can cross (along with countless convenient "twists" that help the story to continue). Lou Diamond Phillips is the super-confident cop who sends the serial killer Kober to the gas chamber only to find out that he was a servant of Satan himself and now has the resurrection power along with the power to own every weak person he thinks comes across. Through the mix a very poorly performed medium that helps with the case. <br /> <br /> Ahhh, this is rubbish. But nice as such, especially if you have fond memories of it. This scared me as a child and that scene with the homeless is still very good. As for any kind of logic here; forget, every scene is played to good measure and you end up with a cross between an Steven Segal action movie and a demonic movie from the 70s. And who on earth thought it was a good idea to put Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead here? Needless to say, he's not convincing but he tries his best and I've never had the problem with so many guy commentators here seem to have. As for Tracy Griffith as the psychic, the less said the better. But Kober is very good as the killer; I always liked this actor. "The First Power" may be exactly what the doctor prescribed after a hard day's work and a "brain shutdown" is needed. The beer will probably improve the viewing experience and I'll definitely have a bunch of it the next time I take a look at that movie. Yet; is not a good movie, but a rather guilty pleasure for the nostalgic fans who were easily frightened as children. "See you around, boy friend!"
