Words can not begin to describe how terribly terrible this movie is. I wish it was "so bad, it's good", but it's not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad I could not even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the film. The only less charismatic person is the director Brett Kelly, who, as a true statement about vanity, presents himself as the male protagonist. Both look like inbreeds, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> The gal, Sherry Thurig, is a looker. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and slender and can act. Although you can tell she's holding on. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to be holding on, especially the support male, Mark. I've seen less wood in a rainforest, but he's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep her acting actors? Is he really that bad as a director? Everyone else summed it up perfectly - there is not one. The children are kidnapped and Kelly finds a way to solve the crime. I know how he felt stepping on poop, that's how I felt after watching his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money back from the network. This is a home movie that should be left to be seen by the director's friends (and if you look for them, you'll see that those same friends were the ones who gave the film positive notes).
