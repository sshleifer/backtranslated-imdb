I do not know if this is one of SyFy Channel's original movies, but that's exactly what it sounds like. An inexpensive, low-budget action movie that was probably done quickly, it contains laughable effects, stupid dialogue and a star faded to give some recognition to the brand (funny how many 90210 kids are making cheap movies on TV now Ian Ziering plays Cortes, that we know of history as the exploiter who wiped out entire populations of native peoples while conquering parts of North America.Here he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a viscous opportunist, his character would probably be killed if it did not was based on a historical figure.In this story, Cortes is on a brief mission to survey, trying to find something of value to prove that he deserves funding to further explore America.He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs tormented by dinosaurs . <br /> <br /> The true hero of the story ends up being Lieutenant Rios, who he is honest, resourceful and wise. He knows the right thing to do in all situations, which puts him in opposition to Cortes, as well as to the young and ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, the native girl who was supposed to marry the stubborn, stubborn shaman falls in love with Rios, increasing her anger over the Spanish outsiders. So it's all very clich√©. Dinosaurs are dispatched with relative ease. Despite taking place in an area that seems open, the story practically happens in the woods, or in the Aztec village for 95% of the time, so it's not visually exciting either. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow he disappeared. It does not look or looks like Spanish for a second, however, making the choice of the wrong cast in every way. If this movie had been released in theaters, it would have been chosen for a Razzie, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Overall, forgettable.
