Watching this movie made me think constantly; Why are they doing a problem with some broken brakes? There are a million options to decelerate the car! In the movie Speed, the writers at least thought of a good reason for the car not to be able to stop ... <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about this movie; all the usual narrative clich√©s make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is as leaked as a sieve etc. This makes this movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
