In the past, I remembered watching Nintendo Power idiot comics that had the same artwork as this show ... and then came the news that this show was coming to a television near me! I was not static but curious ... I was curious about how bad this show was going to be bad. All my friends said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for heterosexual people like me to enjoy (I'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the program with low expectations. <br /> <br /> A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate the new characters. Tiff and Tuff are such idiots and I hate how many fanboys babble on Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they made Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his nonstraight name was) a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing more than a losing adviser to King Dedede (who is a great success in this program) and I hate the face of that company that continues to supply Dedede with those terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> I started to hate Kirby even more, since it was obvious that Nintendo was aching to have Kirby a little more popular. Kirby will never defeat Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby will always be nothing more than a little bit of homosexuality. NUF SAID !!!
