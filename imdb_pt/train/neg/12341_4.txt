Spoofs of terror are not just a thing of the 21st century. Long before the 'Scary Movie' series, there were a few examples of this genre, especially in the 1980s. But, as the franchise said, most of these films are unpredictable. Some like 'Elvira, Master of Darkness' most often rise above this, but others like 'Saturday 14' and their sequel can not laugh. But of all these types of movies there is a particularly large offender and that is 'Transylvania 6-5000', a big waste of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Pros: A great cast that does the best. Some of the stupid humor is fun. A corny, but catchy theme song. Some good places in Transylvania. <br /> <br /> Cons: beat up plot. Mostly tedious rhythm. Most of the humor is not enough. The monsters receive little to do and little time on the screen. I thought this should be a parody of monster movies? Lame ending will probably make viewers angry. Final Thoughts: Is This A Comedy? If that's why the really funny parts are so few and far between? Comedies supposedly make us roll on the floor, do not roll their eyes and yawn, yearning for it to end. I can not believe Anchor Bay has released this tired trash. I admit it's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not worth anyone's time, not even if you're a fan of any of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. My rating: 2/5
