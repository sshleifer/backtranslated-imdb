The film appeals to the public due to the charisma of Ben Stiller and the notoriety of J. Aniston. It looks like we have a recipe for a hit title here, but there is nothing successful in this movie. <br /> Polly is very well played by Aniston, no doubt. This is the kind of character that fits her perfectly. Well Stiller is the same troublesome guy as in Meet the Parents, but in this movie the comedic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above. <br /> <br /> The script is very poor with nothing special. With these two well-paid actors, things could get much better - but what can they do when there is such a bad story and script? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
