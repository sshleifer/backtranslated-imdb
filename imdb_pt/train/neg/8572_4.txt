A lean story concerns two small-town siblings and their struggles for family honor. David Morse is the responsible and straightforward cop and "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, the "bad boy", is a former ex-soldier and condemned. As an actor (particularly in his early years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under Method. By becoming a writer and director for the first time for this artistic and obtuse drama, he works his script and characters through the same methodical process, slowing down a trail (ostensibly so we can pick up all the nuances and inflections). This approach can be fascinating if there are three-dimensional characters to worry about, but the Morgen and Mortensen photogenics are not really convincing as siblings. Worse still, we expect more from veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who will hardly have the chance to present something interesting. The image is balky with voluminous sequences, a faltering narrative and confusing editing (always inclined to point out artistic excesses). Penn's tricks with the camera show a talented eye, but they are, for the most part, an irritation. * 1/2 of ****
