Okay, I saw this movie for the first time at 9:00 at Cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be awarded, boy I was 180d about it. This movie bit the big one. I mean, the mother of the monsters shows their true form only at the end of the movie. I'm going "Is that it? Why does not it show briefly a little earlier in the movie?" The plot being the mother and the child revel in the blood of young women. Would not it be better if they just kept going, you know, a kill killing like a couple of young women each, then having the sheriff or a cop discovering and getting into the old way of killing the monsters, saving the women / young women and having 1 more or 2 people killed in the process? I think it would be a lot better this way. It is also a drug because the son is the main character and he is killed first. Why not get rid of the mother first? Also, how does she have that strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? She said she was very weak. What the hell was wrong with Stephen this time? I never, ever can dis act in any movie of any actor, after all, they try their best. If it was not for good acting, I would give this movie a 1/10. 3/10
