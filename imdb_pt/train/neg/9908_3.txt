I have given these 3 possible 10 stars - because the stories are open and left unexplained, and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way, as well as scenes of a decaying corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above had to be shown graphically. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film, as it is, refers to three loosely intertwined stories, none of which it concludes satisfactorily. The bounty hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character who connects all three vignettes. <br /> <br /> First we have Dylan McDermott, looking very well, like a wanted criminal who is fleeing to Mexico to escape the law and the bounty hunter when he crosses a border town and sees a sad face played by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> So we have one of Hemingway's girls. I'm not sure which one, throwing a western wife on the lonely border who goes there to see a neighbor woman, an attractive redhead, whom we soon realize was in the barren land a little too much. <br /> <br /> The completion of the movie returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene of the film being completely beyond rational understanding.
