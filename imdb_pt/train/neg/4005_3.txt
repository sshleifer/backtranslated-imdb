I am a true fan of the original Cracker series and I own all of them on DVD. Cracker tended to be exaggerated from time to time, but Robbie Coltrane and the other cast members, as well as the writers, always seemed to get along after all. I count the original Cracker among the great British TV crime series of the time, and there is strong competition: the first-suspect, Inspector Frost, Inspector Morse, Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Homes, and a host of others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> What makes "The New Terror" even sadder ... <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this was a very pale imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to sit down with the whole thing, convinced it could not be that bad, and that some spark would ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from start to finish. <br /> <br /> A few criticisms: First, just to anticipate any potential bias: I was offended by the anti-American, anti-war. table that stirred for most of the show. The topper: the murder of two innocent Americans of any crime and a British Junkie is, in Fitz's words, "understandable but not justified." I thought, "Did I go through two hours of shit just to hear this disgusting idiot thing?" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone brought by my beliefs ... Beyond politics, I had the distinct sense that this Cracker was just a prop for propaganda, and it really helped to undermine one already terribly weak script. <br /> <br /> Second, how much time did Air Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a player in this, as if he were a later thought connected to some story originally written without any thought about Fitz's role. Coltrane could have carried the spectacle on his own broad shoulders and still adequately flabby, but the writer was apparently thinking of other things, and missed the chance, and by a wide margin. <br /> <br /> Third: WHAT IS AN ABYSMAL? SCRIPT! There was some glow and some real developments (Fitz's son complaining that Fitz could not stay in his house if he lost his plane to Australia, the detective who liked to hit his poor performers from the back of their heads, and some of the old ones sparks between Fitz and his Miss), but not enough to lead the tedious plot. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? Now that would have been interesting... After all, it was Manchester, and ten years later she would be in the ranks. <br /> <br /> Well, there's a lot more (this is bad) to say, but I'll close with a curiosity: at the end of the show (as it was aired) on the BBCA), when the announcement announced that "Director's Cut" was available on BBC On-Demand, I thought AH-HA! The cut of the director, who, presumably, someone has to pay, may have all the goodies I expected to see tonight, but never did, as an interesting and coherent plot. Unfortunately, after convincing me to go through the horrible free version of "A New Terror" with the hope of seeing something, anything worthwhile, just to be disappointed, I have no hope of motivating me to pay for a second , potentially longer and tedious version. Also, it infuriated me to think that BBCA sliced ​​and smashed, and sacrificed show times to accommodate the endless stream of commercials (every ten minutes or so), and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been the version broadcasted tonight. To conclude, I quote the first paragraph of Variety magazine about "The New Terror": it really says it all: "The initial excitement of Robbie Coltrane reprise his role as a womanizer, drunk, womanizer of the BBC The psychologist criminal is dominated by the heavy-handed rapporteur for political statements that Jimmy McGovern is determined to do within this revival framework, at first shaking his message - namely, that Americans are a bunch of people who do not care about terrorism before it comes on our doorstep - McGovern's speech on the chest expels the narrative and silences the pleasure of seeing Fitz back to the case.
