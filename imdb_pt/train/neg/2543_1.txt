talk about your waste of money .. I'm just wondering why Michael would star in a turkey like that movie .. Michael is a great actor, especially in the movie in which he plays a man dying of cancer .. that was wonderful . as he watches for his son to see him once he grows up .. Michael is such a talented actor .. so what made him do it ?? I watched it and thought it was really dumb ... I think at some point in their career they have the bad movies ... especially "The Squeeze" I did not understand That No way, and I feel that their best performance was in "Pacific Heights", his character really scared me .. and I really liked "Multiplicity" ... that one was so hilarious !!! and he was just perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I kind of liked it "Night Shift" and I love "Johnny Dangerously" too .. just too bad, some of them end up making bad movies .. like this was ...
