How's that movie? <br /> <br /> It's colorful! <br /> <br /> There's some awesome underwater photography! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times! <br /> <br /> So, 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music is accelerated! Especially when the shark or thugs are about to enter! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's retarded! As if to broadcast to the public, it's time for sympathy! <br /> <br /> While another bites the dust! As if in a "Western spagetti" this bears a lot of resemblance to! <br /> <br /> It's not that Italians can not produce quality productions! There were a number of TV movies with a title like "Octopus," numbered 1 to 7, featured on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about Mafia-type conflicts! And they were great! But unfortunately, you will not find it here !!! <br /> <br /> I assumed it was made around the 60's! Unfortunately it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was the sharp bite of the swift shark that makes a red dust emerge repeatedly in the bluish waters! In the midst of all this, whether in bar fights or watching the latest bloody demolition on the side of the relentless hungry shark, the hero's companion looks through his glasses of little concern as if he was also bored in his ruthless role amidst the lack of much plot evidence or character development of anyone! <br /> <br /> At least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly to his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if the music can not awaken our understanding, we have the sinister sound in the voices of the bad guys, as if we wanted to poke around us that other obscure action is about to come! <br /> <br /> And near the end, someone thought of a turnaround! Only when we thought everything was totally predictable! But stay tuned, guys, 'cause you can find another twist! If you're watching closely! To, more or less, warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and have some beers along the way! This will make your viewing of "Night of the Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> So you'll be ready for something like a movie "007" to ease your way back to reality when it's over !!!
