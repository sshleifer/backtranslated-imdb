I have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for ages absolutely and it was only recently when I had the opportunity to watch this adaptation. I have heard many positive remarks about this, so I had high hopes. As soon as this movie ended, I was horrified. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was an extremely poor adaptation and virtually 4.5 / 10 of the book was omitted. In particular, I discovered that many of the characters and some great scenes of the book were not in this. There was not much dialogue, it was rushed and very fast but I was mostly annoyed by the fact that you never got to see the connection and love between William Beech and Tom in this movie which was a real disappointment. The cast was not that good either. I thought this could have been very good, but it was very different from the book! Very poor adaptation, one of the worst I have ever seen. That deserves a decent remake that would be better than a thousand times better than this pile of crap.
