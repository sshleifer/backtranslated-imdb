I gave these two stars the incredible clarity of DV, which contributes to the cold and dark sterility of their character. That was generous, I know. <br /> <br /> This movie fails all accounts. I can not recommend this because it is neither poetic nor blunt. Neither dramatic nor suspenseful. Neither controversial nor ordinary. It's just a piece of crap that no fan of terror or exploit can recommend in good faith. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, whoever it is. . Please stay away from this horrible product. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
