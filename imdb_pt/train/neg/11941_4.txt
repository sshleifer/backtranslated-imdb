While he makes the joke strange, the mood is usually quite dry, with panel members often pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting in the audience to cheerfully enough jokes. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what another comment says I do not think this is the best TEN ever made, it's really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of intelligence, there are few really funny smart jokes that would make you laugh genuinely loud. People seem convinced by the well-known names of comedians rather than judging the quality of jokes that are not so good. It is usually mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often can be quite mediocre. Not as good as things from Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens. I think Benny Hill's funnier.
