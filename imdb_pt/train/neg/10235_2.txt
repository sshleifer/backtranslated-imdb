The only reason I give note 2 is that the filmography is so stylized nowadays that it has at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is asinine. It's like so many other fodder from the house of the 21st century. Blood is free and simply disgusting. I did not care about any of the characters, but I cared that some jerk would bother writing this crap: I would complain about the money I spent, but my date and I left wisely after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and fun "Live Free or Die Hard," which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I supported the total "Captivity" poop for 40 minutes.
