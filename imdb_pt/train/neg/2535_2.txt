As in last year's event, the WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was spearheaded by an Elimination Chamber game. The difference between the last years and this year coincides, however, with the value of entertainment. In fact, only three people had the chance to leave the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York, with the WWE Championship. These men were current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac put the belt on any of the newbies; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? Kane held the WWE Championship in June 1998, and it was only for one night. It was obvious he would not be the one either. Last year's match was exciting, with six of the best that WWE had to offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing event, but still the start of the night by far. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the night came after the bell played in the main event. Vince McMahon himself was out walking and demanded that they raise the chamber. It was then announced that Edge was cashing his money in the championship game at that time. No time to prepare and soon after the victory in the Elimination Chamber game, John Cena had no chance and lost the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining jumps of WWE. That was the only fun action that happened all night. <br /> <br /> The undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. Triple H and The Big Show made a snoring that made me struggle to stay away. HHH took the win, but that was never a real question, was it? Any pay-per-view that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera on the same card will never stand a chance of becoming a success. The king defeated Helms (who reserves these things?) And Big Vis proved the defeat against the waste of Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his mother. <br /> <br /> The women of WWE also had a busy night. There was the usual absurdity of Diva with a fight between Bra and Panties Gauntlet that was won by Ashley and the Women's Championship was also on the line. In one game, I thought it would have been left to ferment until WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good game. Trish won the contest, but it was clear that this would continue in the foreseeable future. <br /> <br /> The opening night contest will soon be WWE champion against Intercontinental Champion, Ric Flair. This could have been better, but it was a battered and bloody Flair who stayed after a disqualification. Edge obviously had bigger fish to fry. <br /> <br /> So, the New Years Revolution started the 2006 pay-per-view calendar disastrously. The only good thing about it is knowing that, for WWE, the only way is up. They do not get much worse than that.
