Vampires Vs. Zombies was not the original title. It was really ... <br /> <br /> Unpleasant Semi-Vampire Lesbians and Two Zombies Reached by Cars: Special appearances by Bob, the Gypsy Witch-Lesbian and her dog, Random Woman with Special Powers and the School Catholic. Girl short skirt zombie crown. <br /> <br /> Also in the box: Attention: No Plot - only the writer and director will understand the ending, or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I love bad movies. . I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I even like lesbians. This film combined all three with a vague and confusing plot (or nonexistent), a horrible dialogue (I mean REALLY BAD), and random things and people who have nothing to do with anything (or they ... I did not know what in the world was happening). Oh, and I can not forget the green oats 'Zombies' in latex gloves (yes, the filmmakers were so cheap they could not even cover their zombie hands in oats and paint). Anyway, the result was this terribly bad movie, if you could call it that. <br /> <br /> The end should not make sense? Was the Vampire really Nurse and the other girl really a mental patient? Where the Vampires Vs. Zombies Hell, where the Vampires were ... you really could not call any of the girls vampires. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you're really curious ... ok, I'll understand. Seriously, even BAD movie lovers will not be able to afford this. Must be the number 1 in the bottom 100.
