Well - when Jason Miller's appearance (looking even more eroded than he did in Exorcist IV) is the high point of a picture, what do you have? <br /> <br /> It's a little country, a bit of rock n 'roll: mix two drunks with money that drag the boy all over the place with a dry mummy (have you ever imagined that?) - DRIED in a swamp ?) in the basement, Christopher Walken with a bad tincture of work, and a girl who could have been an interesting character if they had developed it. <br /> <br /> I understand - sort of - that they are coming back to visit their relatives. After that ... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are several interesting flashbacks to which I must assume that her mother was killed in a car bomb (I think). This is never connected to anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: What do we need Grandma for? Now, the grandmother might be interesting. She speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something. Maybe you can do something from her. The best they can do is to have a habit of smoking. That is all. <br /> <br /> Problem: They create a real character as the husband. He's cast-type (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can look forward to the fiduciary fund he gets for her) or he's cast against the guy (after all, he's got a good haircut and clothes beautifuls)? He drinks, he hesitates. He's not a bad guy. It is not good. But unpleasant. Why did not they do something to him? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old boyfriend appears. The husband knocks him down. He comes back to overthrow the husband. (It is very stupid, but at least this character has a motivation.) <br /> <br /> NOW - she is an alcoholic, he is an alcoholic; he could only have married her for his money. The grandmother is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her a witch's mummy (are you following this?) That can come to life. In fact, you know it will come to life, the music swells. A girl lives in the house, drinks tea for her grandmother (opens the door to do it) and supplies her grandmother with cigarettes. Periodically, Grandma leaves. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife lose the child at home, and then they lose the room. Uncle has his throat cut in the basement. The protagonist has nose bleeds. The husband drinks. Both drink. In the face of all this, the terrible truth mentioned in the first exaggerated voice is - an Ã´migo - an abortion when the protagonist was twelve years old. <br /> <br /> Despite all these threads hanging ingredients, no one got a story on the screen. No bridge between situations, no gradation of disturbance brings the horrible horror, only long, slow scenes that lead nowhere, no one to care - and they had places to go with that look - the innocent boy in charge of drunks, the grandmother who can be locked because she is a monster, but no, her worst fault is smoking. She has beautiful hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, no plot. Just a bit of random (predictable) violence in a dark library, with the rain spouting, and the soundtrack informing us. You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Production figures were good. Oh. Nice setting, good wardrobe. The cameraman, at least, knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
