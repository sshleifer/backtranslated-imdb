I watched this because I thought there would be a lot of car chases and cool cars to bask in. I think I was fooled. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) sitting in front of a Porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car. When they confirm it is right, Kip picks up a brick in the trunk and kicks it in the window, breaking it. He picks up the Porsche while his friend picks up the keys. They start the car and leave for the night. They deliver to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police. Then the whole team abandons all the cars and follows separate paths. So we got a glimpse of Memphis Raines. He's giving a little speech to a group of kids on a go-kart track. So he is confronted by Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that her brother Kip is in the background * bleep *. Memphis is known as one of the most famous car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not deliver 50 cars within 72 hours. There are some problems with this film: 1. Story: The first 48 hours in the movies happen when Cage and Duvall are looking for a team and planning everything. The last 12 hours at the movies are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. The Cars: You see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie announces. So, where are the other 40 cars? Why can not we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The Chase: The chase at the end of the movie was a joke. It was not all suspense. <br /> <br /> 4. The Dog: Somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well. This is impossible. The keys were opened. The keys would severely damage the dog's esophagus, stomach, and large intestine. Guys suggest giving laxative dogs to help him poop. It will not work. The dog will have lots of diarrhea, but no braces. It was said in Jackass after Ryan Dunne put a toy cart in his rectum. Take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but not car. Same case with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. The Cop During The Chase: When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage desperately tries to start the car. You see a police car behind it that is not looking at your car. But just as Nicholas Cage turns on the engine again, the officer shakes his head to the right, sees the car, and immediately begins to chase after him. This is stupid. Then, when he heard the engine call and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How does he know it's the right car? He only sees the back of it. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I've never seen the original, but I plan. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 10 star. Get The Fast and Furious instead.
