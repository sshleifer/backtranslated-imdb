There was once a director named James. He brought us wonderfully, thrilling science fiction like Terminator and Aliens. These films were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he seemed to have a fantastic future ahead of him, with the emergence of computer-generated special effects on the film industry. Terminator 2 gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new age. <br /> <br /> ....... and then it happened ................ ... 1997 ........ countless awards ... ........ obscene amounts of money ............ strange barrage of advertising ...... ...... maximum profit margin ...... .. Titanic was here! <br /> <br /> I've never (never) been one to jump in the move and be overly critical because of. In fact, I often took the opposite position from the majority just to start a discussion. Titanic, however, was a film that I just took a positive single - Kate Winslett being absolutely beautiful everywhere! <br /> <br /> Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, acting was more wood than in my nephew's treehouse, images meant to terrify were actually comical (man falling ship and hit the prop), historically false (or start me off because there was much), had terrible theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the useless love story was so boring, selfish and pathetic that it disrespected the situation of all involved (I was happy when he died and disappointed when she did not). <br /> <br /> It was clear from the start that this photo was designed to attract MTV's attention, gum chewing, boy chase with car, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself looked like something less heroic than the member of a boy band) who boyfriends hungry for a three-nd half-hour chick-flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point. Millions of idiot vultures from the culture have come to see this expensive waste of celluloid because "it costs a lot to produce, it must be great," and "Steve and Barbara said they were good and knew their movies." <br /> <br /> The glory of the crown came when Titanic swept the plates at the Oscars. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal night on which his three-and-a-half-hour farce was based. It seemed to me that he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune by inaccurately portraying the circumstances that led to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy this type of garbage, they deserve to be stolen. Good luck to Hollywood if that's how they want to make money, I would if I had that kind of chance in life! <br /> <br /> Well on my list of all-time movies with another silly, historically fake / human-interest crew like "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor."
