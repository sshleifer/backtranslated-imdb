This movie is painfully slow and has no plot. It transmits the lives of a group of dismissed boat workers. One of the older ones is sincere in their attempt to get a job. There may be some social commentary here, but, it is confusing as no one is painted in a very friendly light. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why it took a 7.8 when I decided to watch it. I watched the whole thing tedious and created expectations for a huge redemptive reward. No luck. The IMDb rating was always so good for my taste. Anything over 6.5 was worth watching. <br /> <br /> And my wife says that Javier Barem does not look right in this movie. He's not my type, so my deal does not mean much. I sigh. I give a 1.
