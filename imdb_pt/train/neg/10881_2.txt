My friend's mother used to work at a video store and had to preview the movies before they came, so when she brought The Convent, a horror movie, I could not wait to watch it. Given that it's supposed to be scary, but it's really hilarious, I can say that somehow strange, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so funny! "WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!" I did not know that this movie was even released ... I thought it was very bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, so ... Overall, the movie is very bad (you have to admit it in the but I promise you, you're going to have a good laugh at that. <br /> <br /> * This movie sucks, but it's good for a laugh ... especially that guy who holds the 'dagger of despair.' .. THE PUNHA DE DESPAAAAAAIR!
