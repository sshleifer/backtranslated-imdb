I'm still shaking with the idea of ​​never seeing this movie again. <br /> <br /> I've seen action movies, I even liked some of them, but this is an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> Not only has the worst male actor (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role, but the movie plot is so stupid from the start (why not steal the money while the plane is on the ground , would be much easier) that requires a person with IQ lower than their number to believe. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot has no real twist, a three-year-old can guess what comes next. It's a set of clichés (of action genre), with Sly performing even worse than his other films (he was even better on Rambo III if you watched that movie as a comedy instead of an action movie). Now there is an actor who can not act A) surprised B) sad C) anything other than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that can make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are excellent, but then ... you can see better on July 4th. LANDSCAPES are magnificent, but then ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see better views this way, instead of wasting time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Go watch another movie, there are hundreds, even thousands of better action movies.
