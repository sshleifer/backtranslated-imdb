No one else got tired of that old clich√© 'where a near-dead person appears in a horror movie, gives us some information, and then blows his head for no apparent reason? I know I am. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the use in this movie is useless. If you saw the first movie (the first remake I should say), then the information given is completely useless, because you should already know that. I think, you might not be useless for the main characters ... but then why the idiot shoots himself in the head? Would not he want to live? Of course, he would have died anyway. <br /> <br /> This is the second film to be titled "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first is the continuation of the original 1970s film. This is where it gets a bit complicated for someone like me. You see, I'm probably part of the minority of people my age who even knew there was an HHE2 to start, let alone an original HHE1. And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named just like the sequel to the original HHE1 ... it only makes it worse! But anyway .. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original Hills Have Eyes was decent. In the end though, the idea was better than the presentation, but it probably had a low budget. To be honest, Wes Craven is not quite as good as a director of horror. He made just a few good horror films (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some good ones (Scream) and a bunch of horrible ones (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yeah, and he did Swamp Thing, too ... but the original HHE2 falls into the last category. I only saw a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he co-wrote the new HHE2..and it's a disappointment! The remake of HHE from last year was even better than the original movie. It was tense. I think it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family, not a lot of beer and marijuana and sex-crazy teens. That made us feel dirty. In the first hour, we were in hell and finally, in the last moments, the good guys took revenge on the bad guys and felt good. <br /> <br /> This new movie has no tension. No suspense. Only violent things happen to generally stupid people. There is hardly any threatening presence here. Ugly vagabonds hiding under rocks. <br /> <br /> I'm getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they make. It was just another day that I watched "Deep Blue Sea," where Samuel L. Jackson kept walking across the water while giving the speech, and then he was eaten by a shark, just because the idiot stood by the water. .. something that no one would do in the given situation! Here is exactly the same thing. People go out alone to make a leak, even though people are dying ... seriously, could not wait for a break in the bathroom? And then, when you think people would have learned, someone else will go it alone! Seriously, is not it scary anymore when the characters are bringing their A-game and still losing? I think so ... <br /> <br /> Even under delivery. Should have made the first remake look like "The Fog" remake (which was less threatening than an episode of "Becker"). More bandits. More time in the caves. More tension. Most of all. <br /> <br /> But, in fact, it lowers. Less thugs. No tension. Of course we have more time in the caves, but not much happens there. In the end, it seems that there are only two or three bad guys. The last movie made it look like a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who keeps watching them through binoculars? Seriously, these are the things that this movie should have brought us, but it ends with exactly the same promise that the last movie gave us, with the same "being watched" scene. Let's go! I'll give the devil is due. The look of the movie is good ... but that's it. <br /> <br /> I do not even think blood fans will like this ... although I'm probably wrong! There's bloody blood (though most of it is speeded up while it's in the dark), but without the tension and the characters you care about ... blood does not do anything in my book! In the end, you're not scared. You're not shocked (unless you're an 8 year old girl). You do not even feel like you've seen something new.
