I go to many movies, many times I bring my 5 year old son, I am so glad I did not bring it to this movie. There are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene, however, that's not the main reason why I would not take it to that. The trailers lead you to believe that it's a light comedy; However, practically all the funny moments are in the previews. I kept hoping it would be interesting, funny, or anything less serious; however, I almost fell asleep as the story unfolded. I understand that dogs can be a great company, that being said, the whole story focused on a poorly behaved dog that owners were not experienced enough to train. If a human caused so much damage and destruction, that person would be banished. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, a waste of talent. The best way to sum up this movie is, the couple gets dog unruly, couple falls in love with dog, dog dies, sad couple. The end.
