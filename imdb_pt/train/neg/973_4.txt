This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has become inexplicably favorite among Western critics. The script is ridiculous, the acting is exaggerated and it seems tacky. The only reasons to watch this novel are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain of the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who fell ill during filming and drank to death at age 40, shortly after the release of the film, has the same fascination of watching a train accident. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacks the competence to perform one of the tasks well. Bollywood produced much better movies.
