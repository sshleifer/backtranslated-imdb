I loved the Dewaere in the Noir series. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers," known as "Going Places." Okay, it's a couple of guys exhibiting the conventions in the most absurd and irredeemable way; many people find this behavior amusing. This was a tedious, pointless exercise designed to shock. I find the smile on Blier's face, the face behind the camera, annoying. The Noir series was a valid expression of personal freedom and licentious behavior. From the first moment we see Patric Dewaere hovering on the abandoned ground, we have an idea of ​​the incredibly handsome anti-hero with whom we will spend some time in the next few hours. When we see him chasing the unhappy middle-aged woman with his friend Depardieu in "Going Places," we have a fair warning that two hours spent with these guys will be draining. I have trouble getting even a "3" for this boring distraction.
