This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. From the first scene, I knew it would be a big accident. It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns on a mission. As it turns out, people in it were possessed by some random zombies. Well, a few years later, some college kids are making some jokes. Horrible performance goes from commitment to head athlete. Things like the athlete screaming at him to do things in a well-hectic way, with the promise to react and exaggerate across the paper "eager to be popular." What really took the cake with this is the final battle. Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with weapons. For example, weapons making noise without muzzle, and vice versa. this is accompanied by animation zombies (why they move in stop motion is a mystery), tacky music and about 40 weapons that come out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie sucks. Just like many others, you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low-quality rental store.
