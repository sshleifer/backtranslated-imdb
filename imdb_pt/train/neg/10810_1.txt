There's only one thing I need to say about this movie - the scene in which Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra's character about wanting to be a genius; never see this movie. The story is horrible, the acting is terrible (come on, it's Shaq!) And I'd rather see Capra in Free Willy (equally horrible) twice before seeing this movie.
