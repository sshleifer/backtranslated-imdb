Okay, guys, we know why we watch movies like "The Invisible Maniac" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A all over the place (with much more T than A). But ... should not there be a story to follow? <br /> <br /> "Come on," I can hear you say- "this is just girls getting naked! Who needs a story?" Well, if it were called "The Knuckles Maniacs," I would not have problem. But since these guys are cribbing from "The Invisible Man," they need to have some history out there, you know, to keep their mind occupied. <br /> <br /> However, all they can muster is like that. A crazy doctor creates a serum of invisibility, and when he cracks, he uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing many teenagers. And when you see the teens he's looking for, you'll be grateful. <br /> <br /> A star, for the T and A, but there is some blood for the skin fans, so go ahead. with caution. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - yes, it's THAT Savannah.
