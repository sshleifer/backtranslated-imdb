This movie must be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! With the exception of a few laughs and one or two scenes of blood, this movie is a complete waste of time. Call it "Campy" does not even cut. "Campy" implies fun that this movie was not. You spend the first half of the movie thinking "Gotta get better, right?" To be fair, in the end, when you finally explain who the "brother / sister" team is and what they want then you hardly care because you spend all the second half of the movie wondering exactly what Mr. Onorati and Mrs. Pacula did not please anyone because they were stuck in such a horrible movie? <br /> <br />
