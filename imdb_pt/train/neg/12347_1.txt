This is easily the worst film by Ridley Scott. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this movie is a black mark in his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally miscast in a superaggressive movie about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is never a scene that is convincing in any way. It's not really difficult to make a film like this. Everything the team does could have been an idea from anyone. The writers also did not have much inspiration; many silly dialogues that made no sense at all; and some brainless action. I strongly recommend to stay away from this crap. I hope the many talented people involved in this project realize that this kind of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on films that are more honorable and smarter than this useless mess.
