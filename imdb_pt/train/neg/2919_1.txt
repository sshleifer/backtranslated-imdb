Wow, as a gay man who lives in New York, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the part of the gay culture that is portrayed in this movie - and I'm happy about it !!! Was this movie broadcast on TV in the United States? It would be a great anti-Gay reaction and I can not say that I would blame them. The people in this movie do not represent the average American Gay or even the average American Trandgender, which they represent is an absolute and absolute nightmare. The inclusion of obviously minor characters is terrible and obvious (anti-whites) racist feelings are flagrant and unsettling - society can not be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and rejection of education by the cast of the film - their actions are not acts of despair, but a rejection of anything that resembles personal ambition and a willingness to do something outside of itself.
