It has its merits; Morvern Callar is both merit and disappointment. She is so enigmatic, so original. Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that makes it so distant and uncontrollable? Or is she as a reviewer called her a revolutionary? Personally I would call it dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern is separating completely. Arresting her boyfriend, not thinking about informing the family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, she selfishly sneezes on a trip to Spain. She seems so devoid of anything relatively human. The only element that allows the public to see the human side of her is her close friend, she takes a vacation with her. Although in the end her friend is abandoned and Morvern has nothing that connects her to humanity. She might as well have killed herself. <br /> <br /> Despite having managed to make Spain look as dark and bland as the UK, the director's photos were excellent, lighting and color made the film visually impressive. <br /> It is really a pity the film has nothing that holds interest. It's just over 90 minutes, but it seems much more. They can make Morvern seem interesting to get your attention, but do nothing with it, just push it away from you more to the point that you do not care about the characters or the movie.
