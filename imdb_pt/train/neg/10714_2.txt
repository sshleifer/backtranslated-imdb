For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was horrible. Fast forward and never better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is a great writer, I thought she would be very good at comedy. The previews were so good, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a girl's movie, it sucked. What is up with that. The movie was very slow and annoying. I would not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like my money back for this! BOO of us here in Arizona. Thank you, but no thank you. Who does this kind of stupid thing to make people think you're pregnant? I thought it was going to be so funny, I had my own kids and I helped others to have kids. It could have been more along the lines of reality.
