... the first movie I had to leave. And it was the cast and pre-selection team (Not that I was involved, I rush to add). I managed to get past the first hour, so I think I'm qualified to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other reviews here, how did this go through any kind of quality control. An accumulation of the worst in dialogue, the epitome of the acting of wood, the horrible cast, all wrapped up without a plot. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald's cast was bizarre, almost comical. She has the worst Russian accent in movie history. <br /> <br /> When I left the exhibit, the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the theater. They obviously could not sit down again. <br /> <br />
