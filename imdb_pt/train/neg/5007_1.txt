There is no reason to see this movie. A good plot idea is treated very poorly. In the middle of the movie everything changes and from there nothing makes much sense. The motive for the murders is unclear. The acting is horrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was excellent in In the Bedroom, but here he is terrible. Buffy's Amber Benson has to change her character someday. Even those of you who enjoy free sex and violence will be disappointed. Even though the movie has 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this), there are no scenes deleted on the DVD, which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts for the movies. characters. <br /> Do not spend time with that.
