This is a really bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the plot sucks! There's maybe a funny joke, it's stupid and it's boring. Throughout the short film, I was falling asleep and wondering when that was going to end. <br /> <br /> Nobody acts like a human, and everybody acts stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider acting like an animal is not something I would pay to see. It seemed funny, but bottom line: do not waste your precious time on a ridiculous and stupid movie. <br /> <br /> I was wondering when it would end, even if it's a short film. At first we thought it would be better; but it gets worse. Stupid, all the way to the end. I left the movies, and I remember that movie as extremely bad forever. <br /> <br /> The writer and co-producer of this movie is a TV writer for the Simpsons, but this is nothing like The Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!
