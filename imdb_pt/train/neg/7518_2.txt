Horror movies can be very entertaining with low budgets, poor acting and a little pride. I think the film is lacking blessing, because, one scene deaf after another, people make ridiculously harmless clutches in the air. If it was not so annoying, it might be funny. <br /> <br /> A horror movie can go a long way with a weary concept like "college kids in a haunted house," just like Evil. Dead movies had a lot of fun with a standard plot similar. Hallow's End, unfortunately, does not go far. Actually, it's not going anywhere. He spends most of an hour creating faceless, anonymous characters with what appears to be an endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against character development, not even in a horror movie, but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha male, the milquetoast, the ... a ... disposable characters that exist mainly for scenes of sex). more than forty minutes without blood, with the dronants, were more terrible than when the bloodshed began. <br /> <br /> Well, it involved bloodshed anyway. When college boys become what they wear, like in their haunted house (a vampire, one wearing O.R. apron and some white pancake), they look a lot like the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes; The Dead Hate The Living, using a similar theme, is a masterpiece in comparison. There is really nothing to talk about, nor are there any real scares. <br /> <br /> I thought about it in almost every approach. If it was to be a tight, suspenseful horror movie (which would explain why things went so slowly), pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it. If it was to be a genuine horror film about blood and guts (which would explain the problem) ... where's the blood and the courage? And the anticlimax is one of the uninteresting endings of a movie I've ever seen. It is the kind of film that, although it does not have a narrator through the film, is told by voices, because all meaningless dialogue was not enough. <br /> <br /> This was a hard drive. ... coming out of it, I wonder if I just watched a Christian horror movie. Maybe the "I know hell exists" opening has not been done that way, but there are some tips (or misguidance - I'm not sure which). Despite all the swearing in the film, a phrase like "gosh-darnit" is a bit absurd, as are most of the crucifixes that worship, God-fearing and Satan-fearing, especially after some T & A sex scenes heterosexual, lesbian. <br /> <br /> If it's a Christian company (the Highland Myst logo even has a little resemblance to the crucifix), then this movie weighs heavily on the atheist camp. be as bad as a filmmaker. <br /> <br />
