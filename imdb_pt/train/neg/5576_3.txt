To this day, when you talk about Japanese cinema, most people do not talk about Rashomon, Seven Ronin or Ran. To the masses, Japanese cinema means all those monsters that we learn to love destroying Japanese cities repeatedly, often in battles with each other. The first and largest of them is Godzilla who returned a dozen times or more and in some films faced the three-headed monster from outer space, Ghidrah. <br /> <br /> Oddly, according to the times, the special effects got a little better. But part of the charm of those old movies was to see those papier mach√© scenarios destroyed, they looked so fake, maybe three steps above Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some future visitors have traveled to Japan to insist. that Godzilla be destroyed since he was discovered. And, in fact, it was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II, when it protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island of American troops. But later, with atomic testing on Bikini, Godzilla, the likable dinosaur just like Barney became the evil machine we met at the movies. <br /> Of course you eliminate Godzilla from what gives Ghidrah a clear field. destroy Japan so that it does not become the economic colossus in 1991 when the film came out. More I will not say, but we all know that Japan is doing reasonably well in 2010. Like all the other Japanese monster movies, sit back and enjoy the chaos.
