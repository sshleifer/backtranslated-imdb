Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a terrible idea to start with. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. While part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots, at least it was funny. There's nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, jokes, and jokes are naturally funny. Hitting the viewer on the head with tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this movie was aimed at juvenile imbeciles who will laugh at anything. When they attended the high school class, any sense of self-respect was thrown out the window. Ring parodies are not funny. I've watched them in comedies since 1998. They're so old-fashioned. Michael Jackson's jokes are not cool either. What's even worse is making fun of two broken ones have been "artists" whose best days ever were. <br /> <br /> The death of American cinema has been slow. Films like this are the nails being hammered into your coffin. What happened to the real mood? I did not laugh out loud at a movie theater a long time ago. Many bad movies rot the brain. Do you want proof? Go to the local mega-chain video store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe in hype. I'd rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than suffer with this poor excuse of a comedy again! <br /> <br /> It is definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
