An interesting story about a soldier in a war who loses the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event, though he has saved many other children in captivity. The film shows a head and this soldier is now a high school teacher who is mainly managed by police patrolling the corridors, restrooms and even classrooms. In other words, high school is a prison and most children pay little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren, (Sam Decker) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides that he will give up teaching and go to another field. However, the principal asks him to take a detention class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the movie that all hell breaks loose and history becomes a complete PUMP. Try to enjoy it if you have decided to see it!
