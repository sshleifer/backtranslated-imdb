In the beginning, we see the beginning of a secret council of some types. Everything looks very promising from the start. With some supernatural elements, the mystery becomes more interesting by the minute. The main character who appears to be a good guy gets in trouble because of his claim to money, he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and want to know exactly what's going on. Normally, a person in your situation would have several options. Somehow he does not have these options. In this movie, there seems to be only one solution, even though it's clear that it's not his fault. From nowhere, he meets characters who talk about church, prayer and God. And they provide the answer to his problem. It should be obvious at one point in the movie what this solution is. Now let me tell you that there is nothing wrong with this message. It has always been useful. But was it really necessary to disguise this message? This religious element really ruined the viewing experience for me. While the message is good, simplicity can not escape the fact that in real life more need to happen to solve the problems presented in this film. The mystery that is presented to us is never solved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm Mcdowell. The once brilliant actor is appropriate, but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious. He really must be desperate for money. Otherwise, what would an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this.
