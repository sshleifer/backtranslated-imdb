I'm a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after watching Mongol, which is absolutely amazing, and which I highly recommend, I had high expectations of a film by Sergei Bodrov. But it was terrible, horrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie I was expecting for something exciting to happen, but that did not happen, so I was at least expecting a great epic battle at the end, but even that was a big disappointment, just a few random rushing around, waving with the swords. .. There are so many good warrior movies, this is not one of them.
