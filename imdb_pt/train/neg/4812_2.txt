I figured any horror movie with Orson Welles would be weird. Necromancy certainly was, but it was a little strange for his own good. The film really has a scary feeling as it deals with a coven of Satanists / witches in a small town and an attempt by a young woman to escape them. The director seems to be deliberately trying to confuse audiences with flashbacks and dream sequences. By the end, there are many unanswered questions. What's worse, as the story is so confusing, it's very difficult to cheer for any of the characters. It seems strange that Welles would agree to make this film especially because he does not have much to do. Maybe someday they'll put a tape of the captures and recording mistakes of that movie. Now that would be really fun!
