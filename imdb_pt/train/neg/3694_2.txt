This is arguably the worst Rajnikanth movie of all time. The first part is performed with a solid comedy of Goundamani, but progressively becomes increasingly worse and completely illogical. Our hero also makes an excavation in Saints with the same name (Baba) through a tacky one-liner and absolutely lame. The first half has Rajni uttering his usual variety of oneliners and style and in the second half he becomes a holy saint after a beggar takes him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas where Babaji (not the famous Saints he dug earlier ) gives it special powers for no apparent reason (other than karma). This is really starting to get interesting now, is not it? <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about him squandering his benefits and magical powers and fighting against politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation. Oh, and the black magic never worked on our hero because he simply had a Param Vir ... er .... Shakti Chakra with him. Bandits and the usual political villains are clich√©s, overloaded with work and in the end, completely insignificant for the plot that is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> But despite all the flaws, it was fun killing time. with and shouting Baba related to the annals during public events. It's also fun to watch others curse about this movie. AR Rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his film through the cell phone. That's how important he considered it. Rajni is very popular in Japan and he has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this movie just to because of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese can stop watching Rajni movies after seeing this. This film was probably promotional material for Rajni to enter politics, but the film's results themselves would have killed any of his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Fun if you turn off the brain.
