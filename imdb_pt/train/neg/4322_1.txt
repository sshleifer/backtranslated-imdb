Read and write down - you can save 88 minutes of your life (that's all!). Incessantly gloomy, this movie sets out to produce (I think) a small modern American Christmas town. Fable in the Capra style. If it fails .... completely and absolutely will fail. I've been trying to think of a good thing about it and I can not. Let me mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, they spend eternity as immigrant workers in Santa's factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit on trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot .. I will not ruin this for you, but there has to be some light in movies if only to contrast with the darkness, but there is none. Even the photograph is gloomy - the snow is shown at the end of a freeze, everywhere looking cold, wet and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the film has a happy ending (schmaltzy). What a relief !
