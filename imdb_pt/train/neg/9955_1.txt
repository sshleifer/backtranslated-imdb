The whole thing is very beautiful to see ... filming on the European location was a good idea. The main actors are attractive. The score is useful. <br /> <br /> But then they would talk! And the non-plot developed! And it was all down from there. Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is .. Hello, dear, you're not alone. When he does an imitation of Mae West, you may have to hide his face, it's so painful to see. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine how the actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this, or rather, why did he end up stinking so much? <br /> <br /> Since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, perhaps you should have little pleasure here. Maybe it's supposed to feel as empty and cold as death. But still can not recommend.
