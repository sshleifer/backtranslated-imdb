This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Not even. I'm not kidding. All "based on a true story / historical references" aside, there is no excuse for such a bad performance. It's a shame because, as others have posted, the sets and costumes were great. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was a typical "Asian style" song, although I could not figure out where the "modern" song of love came when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Maria. I do not know who wrote and sang that beautiful song, but it was as if suddenly Norah Jones had been transported to the 1500s. <br /> <br /> Hershey syrup blood in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup gushed during the Battle Scenes Kwik-n-EZ. <br /> <br /> But the acting. Oh, painfully sad. Lines delivered as a bad junior high game. If Gary Stretch had donned a potato costume for the 4H County Fair, he could have been more believable. In the end, he looked more like a street thug in Little Italy. Sometimes I expected him to shout "Adrian!" or even "Do you want to be part of me?!". Favorite line: When the queen tells her lover (after vomiting on the floor) "I'm going to have a baby." Does he respond "a child?" I hoped she would answer, "No, idiot, a chair leg! Duh."
