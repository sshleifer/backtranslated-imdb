Oh gosh. good cast, but writing and directing is an art and writing wit and direct acumen is a bit difficult. Even making good comedy you have to hit the moment and the moment. I'm not putting everything down there were parts where I laughed out loud, but that was in very few times. The main focus for me was on the quick and fluent dialogue that left some people annoying in the movie. It may sound great when reading the script in your head, but taking it off the camera is a different task. And manual camera work powers a few parts of the movie. The overall direction was good, but the script was not everything to me, but I'm sure you were reading the script in your head that would sound good. Excuse.
