** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> To recap: Mia (Helin) is returning from the capital Stockholm to the rural Rättvik to celebrate her father's 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest child and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petren). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla divorced and moved to a town. Mia is still single and focused on her career. There is a lot of envy and almost animosity between sisters and conflicts arise around them as they confront each other and have personal problems that they have difficulty coping with. As the party continues (and alcohol consumption), more and more secrets reveal themselves and more and more conflicts arise ... <br /> <br /> Comments: To be the work of a new writer / director, it was disappointing to watch this film to follow in the same tracks as the older Swedish comedy / dramas have been following for years. There are really no new elements or ideas. This movie is based on three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor based only on characters making a fool of themselves. 2) sadness and 3) anxiety. This movement focuses on the latter, almost forgetting the first point as the movie progresses. No loss though, since the mood that's there is not funny. The performances of the cast are good, I think, although it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten. I had hopes that there were new ideas and influences, but there were none. To conclude, there are better ways to pass the time than watching this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
