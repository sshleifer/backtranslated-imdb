The reasons to watch this overturn ... err ... homage to a great movie called Se7en: - It's while your channel sails and there's nothing left. "Someone pays you to watch it." Do a favor and pop the DVD to Se7en, rent it, download it to iTunes, or put it in your Netflix tip and skip The Flock completely. Flock the same story with some changes. In addition, the edition ends with Se7en and ends up taking you out of the story several times. The worst of them is probably flying over the desert helicopters, with the sounds of people chattering on the radio, except there are no police helicopters flying over the city. <br /> <br /> In short: I call it blatant to knock. If you want to be cool, you can call it movie tribute, go ahead, but anyway go watch Se7en.
