I could not wait to see this movie. About half of the movie, I could not wait for it to end. All the (white) actors were delivering their lines as Woody Allen had just said, "Say so ..." So they said their lines on the screen as if they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really speaks, and he does not stumble into his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy part of this movie was as boring as the tragedy and it was definitely never funny or even fun. I must admit I was never a big fan of Woody Allen, and this movie definitely did not convert me. I think his writing was as bad as his direction. This movie will fall as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen.
