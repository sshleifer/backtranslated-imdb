I will not criticize the movie. Not much to talk about. There are good scenes of animal actions that were probably surprising at the time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly a matinee idol. He is a bit thin and not particularly handsome. But it's alright. He is the man in this lion cage. We know that when he can not take the time out of his lions to take care of his girlfriend, he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day. Someone said earlier that it is a history lesson. The scenes at the circus are from another day, especially the kids that go around. I did not realize that even in the thirties they sailed on three schooners with masts. It looked like something from 1860. I think it's the footage they had. No wonder the thing has been destroyed. They are always talking about fixing it. There is even an airship. It tells us a little about the female relationships at the time, a sort of laughable nonsense. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can have fun watching.
