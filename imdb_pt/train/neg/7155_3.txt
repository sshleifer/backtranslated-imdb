I'm sorry, but I did not really like this doc. I can think of a million ways that could have been better. The people who did this obviously do not have much imagination. The interviews are not very interesting and no real insight is offered. Filming is not set up in a very informative way. It's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves fascinating special features. One thing I'm going to say is that Isabella Rosselini looks more beautiful the older she gets. All things considered, this only gets a '4'.
