If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a New York street pimp, or John Wayne as a communist spy, then you may believe that Pat Boone is a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you could enjoy this movie. This movie is so stupid that it's not even exaggerated for a sexless love story from the 1950s. And the problem is that Hollywood did a great deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman and not his wife at screen before its release that the public knows that it will not kiss Shirley Jones, so you can not build any expectation for the "consummation of the screen." from your love. It's like watching a western where cowboys have no guns. <br /> <br /> History is useless. Even the title song is sung with painful enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> April Love belongs to the worst bargain of the movie along with Ishtar and Plan 9 of the Outer Space.
