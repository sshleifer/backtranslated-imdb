Tobe Hooper is possibly the most violent that the horror genre has to offer. Like any other horror fan, I loved Texas Chainsaw, but I think to put your name up front in a movie title, you should have at least more than one hit movie. I really can not think of any other films that Hooper has made (on his own, do not count Poltergeist) that have really impacted the horror genre or the movie world. And this movie, Night Terrors, only reinforces my point of view. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I credit him at least for doing a good job with the horrible stuff he got. He did what he could. As for the movie itself? Pure drudge. Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes, a story that must have been written in a really cinematic scene and music. Nothing in this movie is redeemable. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Overall, 1 out of 10. I'm sorry for Hooper, your career seems to be over before it even starts. I hope he is able to extract at least one more good movie, this way he can make his cult status some kind of justice. <br /> <br />
