The twin brothers separated at birth (due to the death of their parents) meet twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and resume their million-dollar tunnel. Double Impact runs in two hours in duration and basically adds no real approach to the plot of Corsica Brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme, while suitable as the twin of evil is just embarrassing as the good twin brother. In addition, the action sequences are not as exciting this time around, and Jean-Claude relies more on shootings than on his martial arts. Also the supporting cast is wasted and in two hours the film is simply bland. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
