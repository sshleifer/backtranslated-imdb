Strictly a routine, by-the-numbers western (directed by the genre-mainstay Andrew V. McLaglen, is it so some wonder?). Army colonel Brian Keith fights with thug Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found his niche after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Fist fights, shootings, stagecoaches and Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking in a low, monotonous tone, Keith revels in a prostitute (a shock after his participation in TV's "Family Affair"), but on the other hand, this cheap material wastes Keith's kindly talent. It's also bad news for Dino, who does not seem to notice or care. Hack direction, poor writing and several bland low humor attempts. * in ****
