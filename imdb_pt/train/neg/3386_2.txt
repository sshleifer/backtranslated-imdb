Yes, I was fortunate enough to see the original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an incredible experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theaters in 1985. It's horrible. Almost everything fails. First, Attenborough (a good actor, a good director with the right stuff) is a sad choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to handle Annie. The camera is always in the wrong place - they cut the songs and CASTING !!! They are terrible - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry and talented artists just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they had the chance - you could not take their eyes off them. But this cast just keeps dancing, does a good job singing, but none of them light up a little bit. In fact, look for the cast of the IMDb - none of them really did much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). Therefore, this iron train of the cinema does not capture for a second the magic, the despair, the passion of the musical stage. A total strike-out! (But anyway they try to muffle the music - good music still comes up sometimes and reminds people how great the score was).
