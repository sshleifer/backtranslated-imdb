What Guy Ritchie has had to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. There was another person in the audience when I saw her, and she left about an hour there. (I hope she has demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed until the end was because I never left a movie. <br /> <br /> But I sat by that piece of garbage completely gaped that Madonna and Ritchie could really think they made a good movie. The dialogue is laughable, the acting is atrocious and the only good thing in this movie is the setting. Ritchie took the film from Lina and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you do not even spend time watching late at night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like that.
