This movie is just awful. It's annoying, it's low quality, the actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen and the scenery is so bad it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> The "main" actor should be the hot guy who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's from the early 90's. > All the characters are away for the weekend for a meeting between friends, but no one is really friend! The couple did not see the "main" guy in over 5 years and even back then they were not really friends. The "date" of the main guy only knows him from work and that there is a girl they pick up at a bar. Now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a weekend in your cabin with people who are not even your true friends. Because that's what he does at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Do not waste a minute of your time with this lemon. I made home movies scarier than that! <br /> <br />
