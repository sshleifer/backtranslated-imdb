Although it has been 2 years, I still remember the complete waste that makes up the whole plot of the movie. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it as we navigated through the new releases of Blockbuster. We decided to choose the movie because it was the only one we had all seen and it looked like it could be nice. Although it has been some time since I watched the movie, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there is no real plot), and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie. If you're in the video store and this movie catches your eye, go ahead and find a better movie. If you ended up seeing this movie, I understand your pain :)
