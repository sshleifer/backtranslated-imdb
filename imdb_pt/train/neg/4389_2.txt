If you enjoy occasional nudity with high school, then look no further. <br /> <br /> Beginning halfway, the beautiful and erotic Arielle Dombasle begins to undress at every opportunity. That's the only thing that made this movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> The story is both ridiculous and absurd, the humor is tacky and the development of the character is basically non-existent.
