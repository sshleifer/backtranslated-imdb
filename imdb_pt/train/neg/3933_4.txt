A huge success after its release with the Australian public, it can still be funny nowadays, but its exaggerated political incorrectness and blunt humor and nothing subtle can make it a little more crappy. This goes on for a long time; some of the content could have been saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, who desperately needed some new material anyway. Granted, his Aussie attitude is funny, but it also becomes annoying as the movie drags on. Some say that Crocker's songs are the best, and are certainly original, but "hilarious"? Barry McKenzie's Adventures will be a milestone in Australian cinema, but we must do everything we can to ensure that the foreign audience does not see most Australians as Barry McKenzies (or even Mick Dundees!). Rating: 5/10
