It's the same thing: "If I can not get funding for my project, I'll inject myself" monster movie. There is nothing new here. It's very much like the movie "Fly" by Jeff Goldblum. Man can maintain some semblance of sanity, but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiences. The acting is very bad. There are people acting stupidly along the way, putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. The guy keeps coming back to the lab he was barred from entering. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. Of course, it looks good, but it seems like a lot of trouble. It's just a big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurus suit seems to have come off the rack at a Star Trek convention.
