this is just a terrible comedy - it really is a bad movie. there are no funny elements. There are no funny jokes. I do not know how some people might claim this shady short film could be 'smarter' or 'quality'. maybe if the only movie a person saw in you could make that statement from the brothers. but, I've seen thousands of better movies: ie, leonard part six (now, this is funny)! I do not know how siblings are considered eligible to be listed in the movie database on the internet: it's more like a home video than a real movie. <br /> <br /> Jokes aside, just skip this movie. a root canal is nicer than this bland and clich√© stuff.
