After seeing this movie, I was sincerely disappointed - not because of the actors, story or direction - I was disappointed with the ads in this movie. The trailers suggested that the battalion "chose the third exit" in addition to surrendering or dying (Polish information was even confusing that they had the choice between being killed by their own artillery or German weapons, they even translated the wrong title as "wrong battalion"). This tickled the right place and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> The deception began when I realized that the third way is to sit and count the corpses, then sit and count the corpses ... Then I started to think, "Hey, this story can not be that simple. I bet this clever officer will find some clever way of saving what's left of his troops. " Well, he did not, they were sitting and waiting for something to happen. And me too. <br /> <br /> The story was based on real facts from World War I, so the writers could not make much use of their imagination, but even thought I found this film really not challenging and even a rather boring . And as I wrote in the first place - it's not the fault of actors, writers or directors - your marketers have raised my expectations above the level this movie could withstand.
