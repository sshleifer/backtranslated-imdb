This is the worst ripoff of Home Alone movies I've ever seen! Watch part 1 and 2, but do not let anyone say that this is better than the first two! I mean, in fact, you do not make a movie, then make a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then do another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would have been nice if this was not a "Alone at Home" movie, but they made a film Alone at Home. Culkin is too old now, so you should stop doing sequels! God, this movie makes me sick! Buy Parts 1 and 2.
