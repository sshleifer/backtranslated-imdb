Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever filmed in BC, but easily the worst, never seeing the light of day. The director is neither Canadian, but British, and boy shows it. We're all meant to be a bunch of overly sexualized junkies and idiots. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and that's why we fund this bunk. Of course the British character is normal. The rest is a serial stereotype crop - can you say "Norma !!"? Cinematography ranges from beautiful postcard images to obscure inner silhouettes. The actors always seem to be restless. Are they as bored as the spectator, or is this the idea of ​​cinema? Avoid this mess and check out some of the Bruce Mcdonalds movies. A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. You will not be required to go out on HIS movies after 10 minutes.
