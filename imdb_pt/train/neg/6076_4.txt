In THE FAN, Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see that the problem with this kind of role is that De Niro played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR, and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts. I found it a little hard to believe that Renard would have started out as an obsessive sports fan frustrated at being a psychopath out and out. <br /> <br /> The character arc is not the only problem with this script - He also does not have one character focus (A problem I had with the UNTOUCHABLES, where De Niro should have been superb, but ended up a bit annoying), for several parts of the film I was thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main character, so the story changes for Renard. It also seems to have disappointed many sports fans who seem to think this should have focused a little more on baseball. I'm not sure if this was done to originally attract baseball fans, but again there are elements that suggest the producers would have decided who and what the story should focus on. <br /> <br /> I admit that I was entertained by THE FAN Especially by the soundtrack), but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that in the mid 90's, characters being chased by freaks like in Single White Female, Unduletful Entray, etc. of steam for a long time
