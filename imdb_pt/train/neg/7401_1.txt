* Sigh * Let us, Finns, get a stupid idea, blow it out of proportion and try to market it as legal. Lordi is a mediocre band at best, and a single trick will get you by now. <br /> <br /> To all of you idiots marketing out there: that's the reason for the inherent minority complex that is found when Finland tries to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not scary. Lordi is lame. Lordi is done. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic face idiocy. Of course, they won the Eurovision. <br /> <br /> No, wait - they've won Eurovision. That's it. I rest my case.
