This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was going to get up and go on Tape 4, but I was left out. I now consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the billboards in Sanskrit? I thought the lead actor (George Calil) was particularly inept. Aside from the bad acting and excessive zeal of the camera, I thought of using the events of September 11 as a reason to make "Larson the Lunatic Implode on a screen near you" be shameful and irreverent to the victims of 11/9. Using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, allegedly from one of the terrorist aircraft that held planes that day, was terrifying. The camera shake did not make me feel sick, that cold heart thud did.
