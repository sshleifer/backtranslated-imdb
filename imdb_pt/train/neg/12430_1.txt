Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. It's the cream of the harvest, or s *** if you tend to be more cynical, since you're up there (or below) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could even be worse than these two, since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. It only made me shudder in pain constantly and applaud as the credits started rolling. No other movie made me shudder in pain. Now I'm going to point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious. <br /> <br /> First, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) That is out of place and how these terrorists want it. Silent things. <br /> <br /> The action that follows is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with boobytraps and all, but seeing these pitfalls being executed is, instead of being funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I did not laugh (or even smile) once, on the contrary, I constantly cringed and waited for the terrorists to arrest the child. The bird, instead of providing comic relief, was dull and boring. <br /> <br /> The acting, as done by a bunch of unnamed, ranges from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D. Linz is absolutely nasty and bland as the kid, while the terrorists act (and, judging by the credits of his films, they look) how they were caught hastily from the street ... and well, that's it. <br /> <br /> I can see some people saying, "Man, it's for the kids. Do not give up, man." Well, MAN, kids might like this, but they can get a lot better. See Monsters SA and Toy Story before even considering this. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who suck - see the reviews for more) are better than this! <br /> <br /> So, in short, this is a hopelessly atrocious movie. This was clearly recycled by money, since it almost disposes of the first two; The only thing is that it totally insults the first two as well. No human, child or any other, should find any reason to see home alone 3. Ever. It's so bad. 0/5 stars
