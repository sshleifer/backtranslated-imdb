Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) came back with this movie <br /> <br /> The film has Govinda in roles 8-9, as his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later he also has disguises < <br /> In short, he is a useless detective sending a case from his friend to get evidence against his wife, whose pictures he loses at the airport while flirting with Rani <br /> <br /> He disguises as a Sardarji on the plane and again as a girl The funny part is how easily he does it in no time? <br /> <br /> Then he disguises himself as a French singer and enters the TV to take evidence and then as a maharashtrian (yes inside the TV itself) <br /> <br /> The rest of the film has the same identities and ends on a predictable note. There are some funny scenes like Govinda being attacked by an African and many others. Portions <br /> <br /> Manoj Agrawal's direction is well Music is well <br /> <br /> Among the actors Govinda proves that he is one of the most assisting actors He as always is a fan Although he has done these roles before fitting into all the poses and roles very well here again, although the much fancier roles of 6-7 do not fit in the film, Rani seems fat, does team well with Govinda who is She is not at all great and kept doing this type of roles Between rest Nirmal Pandey is as always Johny Lever is very noisy at times and funny in some roles and annoys while old Tinnu Anand is well Satish Kaushik is hilarious, Paresh is fine Tanaaz is well
