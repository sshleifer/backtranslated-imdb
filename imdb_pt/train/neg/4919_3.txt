I've rarely been as bothered with a leadership performance as I was by Ali McGraw in this movie. God is she uncomfortable or what? She says it all in the same tone and it's horrible, so horrible that, on the contrary, Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is not much history. He is rich, he is of wood, both need to Sacrifice Much for Love. Her father is Stonewall Jackson, hers is called by her first name, in case you do not notice the difference between the two who won in the name of love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nominations for this movie indicate that it must have been a bad year. John Marley is good as a father of wood, but an indication of support? At least Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but again, if it was up to me, Katharine Ross would have made a lot more movies. She is certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I did not even cry when she got sick, it never occurred to me to feel sad. <br /> <br /> It was cool to see Tommy Lee Jones seeming to be about 15 years old, and the score is good. But this one is so ancient that it has a beard a mile and a half, and the sin of it is that it is not so old, but it seems.
