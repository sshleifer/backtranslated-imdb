I was rooting for this movie as a remake of a 1970s children's TV series "Escape into Night," which, while chaotic and flamboyant at times was definitely weird, fascinating and disturbing. The acting in "Paperhouse" is wood, unintentionally, a joke. The overdubs did not increase the tension, they just reinforced that I was sitting watching a critical fault. Casting exasperated the sad dialogue that resulted in relationships without heat, chemistry or conviction. As in most dull films there are some good acts of support, these people should be comforted, comforted and assured that they will not be held responsible. Of all possible endings, the most unexpected was chosen ... weaker than I could have dreamed. <br /> <br /> "Escape into Night" deserves an adequate remake, written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind.
