The first half of this movie is a pure delight. Romance. Funny. Wonderful performances. A close brother and sister living in Manhattan falls on the same woman! Adult. Bright. Witty. What more could you ask for. As a romantic comedy it starts refreshing. It fits in unexplored territory. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> It goes from a universal adult comedy to a story of getting out of the closet that has been made many times before. What a disappointment. Like a movie of people, start with that promise. Why does it need to turn into such a movie "I am who I am"? The final picture of Heather Graham jumping in the air to celebrate "his happiness in meeting" underscores the banality of the latter part of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magical. It ended up being the same as always.
