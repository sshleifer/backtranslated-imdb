As is often the case, the impressive and explosive trailers of Asian films add up to nothing more than dull stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was great), Dog Bite Dog tells a story in which men are raised as ferocious wild dogs that carry out the orders of their master. The main characters, an emotionally underdeveloped amoral killer who is compared to an equally unstable cop, are far from the common heroes and villains we see often. In fact, in the end, do you lose the notion of who you should sympathize with, not feeling the least emotion for any of the men? if that was the director's failure or perhaps the underscore message he was trying to say, it's up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Although the beginning of the film has been full of intrigue and unpredictability, by half way point collapsed into a monotonous story of survival and revenge. The suspense that was evident at first quickly disappeared because of a grossly ungainly soundtrack that overturned the potentially effective story. And in the end, you got the feeling that all this detailed information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary. On the plus side, has the transition in history from point a to point b been rather atypical compared to US films? so those who are not familiar with Asian movies and are tired of the predictability of Hollywood should take a look. <br /> <br /> The white balance seemed out for most of the film. It was like looking at a photo shot in fluorescent when it should be placed in tungsten. Maybe I'm the one, but it forced my eyes. <br /> <br /> Did the movie also like to do tricks with you ?? an interesting buildup gave me hope for the story that moved slowly until it was diverted to a low-budget, low-speed chase scene. And when you think you're going to get an unanswered indie that ends a mix of Shakespeare's tragedy, you realize it's not an end, it's a transition to a crazy country song set about peace and serenity. <BR> <BR> Play in some stifling, suffocating scenes, a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back to savagery and back to the other side, the Asians' fascination with body fluids and a horrible soundtrack that does not It suited the film, and you have the insipid Asian suspense. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why all the fighting scenes were covered with clips of roaring lions ?? I thought they should symbolize dogs? Ultimately, in the end, are we reminded of a real killer who still hides between us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
