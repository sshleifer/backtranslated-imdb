Honestly, this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen. In part, because you take yourself so seriously, unlike ordinary junk, this movie wants you to get emotionally involved, feel the characters and worry about the alleged conspiracy. None of this even comes close to happening. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS LESTE ****** <br /> <br /> There are three main reasons why this movie is so terrible: 1.) plot Incoherent and totally non-sensory . 2.) Camerawork style "MTV" annoying style. 3.) Moronic characters and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate. <br /> <br /> 1.) Apparently, when this movie was being made, they could not decide whether to film about church conspiracies, stigmata, or possession. So guess what? They combined! An atheist is possessed by a dead person, who then causes her to display the stigmata to expose a church conspiracy. As an ordinary person is able to transcend death and possess another human being through his rosary, it is never explained nor mentioned. Now, instead of just saying what he means, he gives you the stigmata. BECAUSE? Why not just spit? Instead, we are treated to scenes of screams in a rough voice, carving enigmatic messages in cars and writing messages on the walls. Apparently this priest was also a violent subject, because the possessed young woman also wigged one of the characters while speaking in that clich√©, rough, "possessed" voice we have all heard countless times. This also begins to link my second complaint, because whenever the young woman receives the stigmata, she also defies the laws of gravity floating in the air and throwing everything and everyone around her as if they were in an earthquake? Why does it happen? Who knows!?! My guess is that the director thought it looked "cool". <br /> <br /> 2.) This film contains dozens of scenes, in slow motion, of course, of birds appearing out of nowhere and flying, and most annoyingly, from dripping water. This woman's apartment is constantly dripping water! CONSTANTLY! Of course, the place would probably fall apart with so many holes. To summarize this complaint, in the end, and for absolutely no reason, the camera cuts to photos of dripping water, in slow motion, in reverse! BECAUSE!?! I have no idea! It has no relevance at all, and again, I'm betting that's because the director thought it looked "cool." <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters says that he became a priest to explain holes in science. It makes no sense to me. I would think going to church would be enough, but no, he has to go through all the rigamarola to become a priest. I just do not buy. Secondly, there are many holes in the plot, some of which I will elaborate below. To begin with, when she receives the stigmata, the scene ends with her unconscious, bleeding. Then she's in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? Another is at the end, when the character "scientific priest" mentioned earlier is speaking with the spirit that is possessing the girl. He says, "Take me as your messenger!" It is not a word for word citation, but you get the idea. Your answer? "You have no faith, only doubt!" So, because of that, he has an atheist! An atheist has no faith, much less than any scientific father! And so, there's the fact that the conspiracy object of this movie, this Lost Gospel (from St. Thomas, I believe) is available in local bookstores. The characters are willing to kill to suppress this document, but you can go to a bookstore and buy it. Maybe this should happen in an alternate story where it is not widely known, but the film never tries to tell us this, or even suggest that this is an alternate happening of the discovery of that document. <br /> In closing, this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree. It's my arch-enemy, I feel the need to insult every chance I get. I hate it. Final Note: F
