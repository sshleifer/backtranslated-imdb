This was, so far, the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life, and I've seen some REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie in my local video store, and the cover looked like a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to begin? The filming of the movie was scattered and annoying. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a farm on a sunny, normal day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with an unbelievable and unbelievable dialogue and basically no storyline to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and you can make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.
