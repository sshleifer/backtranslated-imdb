Avoid this, unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a key sin in a French film. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to combine epics with Western intrigues, drugs and ancien regime. What? Well, consider that. Cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights. Or how about the woman in panties, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone should do a 'What's Up Tiger Lily' on this bomb. Rewrite the script and then dub or subtitle. Wow, that's almost it now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to the American public, have roles.)
