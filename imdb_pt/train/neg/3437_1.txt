I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit, it was not my cup of tea. Although it's supposed to be such a horror movie. But as I was watching this, I was thinking ... 'This movie does not make any sense ..' Where did this guy in the dark jacket come from? Where were the two guys going when they left the girls behind? Where did a shark come from? <br /> <br /> All these elements in this movie have somehow not been added. I felt like these filmmakers spent so much time and money on a movie so full of shit. <br /> <br /> I've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. At the end of the movie, I told myself I would not watch again .. Both pappy show in this movie, I decided to give the thumb down! Tell me about it! 0 out of 10!
