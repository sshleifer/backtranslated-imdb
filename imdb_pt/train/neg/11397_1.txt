That was really terrible! It had a terrible plot, it was misrepresented and it was like an amateur remake of the dead but not so good. <br /> <br /> It took all my tenacity to get through it, it's a good job. did not have to visit the bathroom more I doubt I would have gone back! This makes the Hammer House of Horror look like a movie epic in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The only value for this movie was the endless supply of beautiful women. Not a bad one among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to enjoy yourself with your friends after a night on the beer, then this is for you ... more, avoid like the plague!
