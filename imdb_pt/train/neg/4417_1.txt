I am a Catholic taught in parochial primary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a practicing Catholic, but I would not be considered a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the church because I do not believe in certain things or act in certain ways just because the church tells me to do so. <br /> <br /> So, back to the movie ... it's bad because two people are killed by that nun who should be a satire like the embodiment of a female religious figure. There is no comedy in this and the satire is not well made by Diane Keaton's overreaction. I've never seen the game, but if it was very different from the movies, then it might be good. At first I thought the weapon could be a farce and the first firing on a plan of female leadership the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual fanaticism of Sister Mary's faith. But it turns out that the bullets were real and the story has tragedy ... the tragedy of the loss of lives (besides the two ex-students ... the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student's mother), the tragedy of dogmatic authority about the love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God. That is what is wrong with today's Islam, and Judaism and Christianity yesterday.
