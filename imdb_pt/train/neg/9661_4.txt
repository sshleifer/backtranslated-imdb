I mean the acting is bad, but I think it was the direction that did it. I never thought much about Highlander (same director), but this one could be guilty in the 80's. <br /> <br /> This, however, has no excuses. People are shot while leaving trenches with a man in front of him! This kind of mistake, coupled with an unclear timeline, strange battle tactics, sub-par cut and bad visual effects, make this movie a sub-par above all else. <br /> <br /> So, like many others have commented, all this American bullshit. The German general was practically afraid of his captured American soldier. Be prepared to swallow a lot, albeit in small doses. <br /> <br /> In short, a non-horrible war movie, but still definitely sub-par in all respects.
