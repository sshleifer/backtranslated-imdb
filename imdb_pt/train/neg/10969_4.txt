Maybe I'm outdated or just do not know what Electra is like in the current publications ... But the Electra I read was much more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. She usually used others to do her dirty work, and most of the time some kind of double cross was involved. Just when you think you have it all settled, she pulls the wool over your eyes and gets her way. <br /> <br /> This film was quite weak in the dialogue, the acting was not particularly convincing, and the action was erratic. I was actually looking for something else along the lines of Frank Miller's book "Electra Assassin." Which is a lot darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effect where legal, action was interesting at times, but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical. Tha Hand was not threatening enough, and Electra was not so mean-spirited. She's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, I did not care at all.
