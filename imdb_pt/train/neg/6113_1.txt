I screamed at my head because seeing this movie was my first 13-month-old movie experience. I remember being incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I watched TV again a few years ago. Big mistake - the acting is wood, the plot is non-existent and the movie lacks merit, unless the 23 year old T & A is what you do ... 0 / ****
