This film is mainly chase scenes and special effects. It is very weak in the plot. Most of the talk about computers was just mumbo-jumbo. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie, which was mainly based on computer facts and real computer terminology. This movie did not have any of that. Most computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame. It is as if it had been written by someone who has no understanding of real computers. <br /> <br /> The Ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point? The movie was boring. Dry it lame.
