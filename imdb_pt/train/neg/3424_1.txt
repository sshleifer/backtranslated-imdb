You may never have seen any movies and you still know that Jerk Too is a disaster. The point is not, "How it was made," because if you throw money at someone and ask them to make a movie, they will. <br /> <br /> No. The question is, "Why, oh, why did Steve Martin let it be done?" I think he needed the money to fight an uncomfortable action and was determined that it would cost him nothing. He knew the sequel was going to be so scary that, out of pride, he would not even tell it was royalties as income. <br /> <br /> The only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin reliving the country's favorite poor black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (also known as Mark Blankfield?): It's simply obvious that you've worked on this movie in some sad way, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the solitary cheerleader of the sequel as a user review of IMDb. I was praying for you to stray into satire, but unfortunately you were really making an effort to turn. Why not 10 stars?
