What is this crap? My little cousin chose this obviously for the overly feminine art and title of DVD ... I decided to watch with her so she would not be bored, and I sure was shocked by the horrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was terrible. They look like amateur actresses reading tips cards. The delivery is insignificant and very stereotyped. Scene cuts were terrible ... it looks like they got straight from the story board, if there was one. <br /> <br /> Second, the jokes and stereotypes were not original or well-played - again, very formulaic. I can not count the times when I could predict the next joke. I have some laughter from the blatantly "subtle" sexual overtones. The cat, the Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. come on! Just .. stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, nor funny. You're just an idiot. It is like a children's movie of children with unnecessary sexual innuendo, vulgarity and violence to increase the MPAA rating. STAY AWAY. <br /> <br /> "Would you like to ride my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they're calling now?" <br /> <br /> "You could ride my ding." <br /> <br /> "Oh! I think I've got blood on my stool!" <br /> <br /> He played poorly, sir .
