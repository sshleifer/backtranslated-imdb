I'm very sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered "masterpieces," but when I see "Lili Marleen" today in 2004, me what everyone is standing and away about this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all smiling like an idiot! - the changes between Nazi glamor and the battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film seems to have been made within two days in an attic. It was probably just like that and a lot of people seem to take it to "real art", but to me this movie is just plain bad and cheap. Compare this with Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
