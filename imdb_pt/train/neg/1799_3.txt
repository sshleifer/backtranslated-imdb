Skippy from "Family Ties" plays Eddie, a nerd 'metal' who is chosen. When her favorite metal singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he releases all the posters on the wall of his room. But when he later receives an unreleased record that keeps the spirit of his 'metal' idol dead. He is sucked for the first time into revenge ideas, but does not want to take him to Sammi. Which is not really as far as its main victims seem to go to the hospital. This film is totally laughable and has a lot to do with real metal like "Rock Star". OK, maybe a little more than this piece of crap, but you get it. And how can anyone cheer for a guy played by Skippy from "Family Ties" I have no idea. The special participation of Gene Simmons is OK, and Ozzy Osbourne achieves consistency, I applaud him for that, but otherwise skip this one. <br /> <br /> My Note: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, an extra topless at a pool party
