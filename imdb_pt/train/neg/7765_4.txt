Strange, almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie. Is it because it is from 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it and therefore forgive the ways of storytelling and childish ways of storytelling? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because some people get sentimental about this movie because they read the book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, filmmakers never assume that viewers have read the book). <br /> <br /> Or is it because I'm subconsciously irritated by the fact that English-speaking actors try to behave like their French counterparts?
