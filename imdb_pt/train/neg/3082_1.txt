Good God, what were they thinking ?? !!!!!! Here's your spoiler warning, even if I do not think it really matters. You will not see this piece of junk anyway. A group of handpuppets goes after a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid hunt to try to kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies . In other words, the whole thing is really stupid. <br /> <br /> You KNOW it has to be bad when even Mike and the Bots can not save anything !! And they did not! I know, some of his lines were funny, like what to add to the "HIT" sign and the hand comments, but, geez, that was really bad. <br /> <br /> All I can say is DO NOT WATCH THIS PART THE CRUD. IT IS NOT VALLEY YOUR EYES.
