I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was anxious to get hooked on another major cable TV series (such as Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but it slowly disappeared with every episode I watched from season one . (no more than the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was unprecedented, invented, and the portrayal of blacks was embarrassing. The dialogue was forced, as writers are trying very hard to be clever and hip. It was a rare moment when I actually made an audible laugh. <br /> <br /> The characters never developed enough that I cared about them, they were selfish and unattractive. I absolutely hated the addition of the brother-in-law (who should have been dragged to catch a predator) and the removal of Hodes' daughter, Quinn, from the cast, sending her to a boarding school in Mexico, was so uninspired and clich√©, than to conclude that the writers were testing the loyalty of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Episode after episode I liked less of the characters and did not get through many of the technical flaws in the story. <br /> Add to this that I heard that the second season was not so good, so I lost all motivation to continue watching this game. <br /> <br /> If you are a good cast and writing fan, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to enjoy unless you are flat and all bets have been canceled.
