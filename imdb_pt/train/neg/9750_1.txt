The film, a Universal version of a Protelco-MLC production, is a boring account of the theory of breaking the molecular structure of an object by capturing it in a cell as "pure energy" and then sending it back to a "target area." There is no explanation WHY this is needed but Professor Paul Steiner (played by pock-mocked actor Bryant Haliday, "Devil Doll") thinks it's something to dedicate his, and his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen) lives for. During an experiment before the noted Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine failed due to sabotage, so he himself "designed" by his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to get revenge. Of course, it spoils and it comes out looking like a "roast pig" with the power to electrocute people. <br /> <br /> With this newly discovered power, he manages to defeat some Cockney idiots, a security guard named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his boss, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He is also able to invade a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat as well. <br /> <br /> In the end, despite Hill and Mitchell's attempt to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. Overall, a completely meaningless movie with no message at all. <br /> <br /> Also one of the most depressing color movies you will see.
