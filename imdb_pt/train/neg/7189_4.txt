What an absolute disappointment! The score of 6.1 here on IMDb created some modest expectations, but, oh my, I was disappointed. The first thing that bothers me is those stereotyped college kids. Yes, I know that teenagers can be childish and so on, but why are they always portrayed in movies as complete idiots? There was a character that I thought was right, but he (not revealing here) was killed before the end. The other characters were poorly executed and even the so-called hero / heroine simply did not do it for me. On the plus side: The plot is very good and the productions are worth a cut up for this type of movie. The acting was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But everything fails with soft characters and braindead. You just stop worrying about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and that's generous).
