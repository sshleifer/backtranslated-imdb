When I was a teenager watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and his various states of nudity in this movie. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is horrible. Remember, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly handsome, and she and her husband-director John Derek make sure to see a lot of her. But when you take that aspect of the movie off, it becomes a big challenge. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular as you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (who is Bo, of course) for the first time, he does not know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet T-shirt, with the chest well visible. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have this problem. If you are looking for a movie to drool over a beautiful naked body, this can fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, fun and worthwhile movie, go somewhere else ... almost anywhere else !!!
