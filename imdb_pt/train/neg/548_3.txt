I saw the IMDb rating of 7.5 in this movie and based on that I decided to watch this movie that my roommate had rented. She said she'd seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw it," she said. Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies this deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other movies I've seen in my life, this deserves no more than a 3. Any movie where I can always guess the that will happen is not good for me. The characters are unbelievable, as the act is not realistic and their motives are invented. It's more dramatic and the songs are not that good. My biggest problem with Bollywood films is lack of subtlety. All emotions are overly exaggerated and therefore unrealistic. Any emotion or bond between characters that is the least subtle should be magnified with unnecessary music. I think I understood that the relationship between father and son was more similar between friends than between father and son, without having to convey it through a five minute song. The stupid comic relief complete with laughter was not funny or necessary (we understand, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). If a movie tries to tear out tears from the most banal media possible, this is not significant, just a bit embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Generally, if someone has lung cancer in the terminal stage, your son who lives with them would know that something was wrong without having to be informed. Lots of holes to tell. At first the film was fun and cute, just as Bollywood movies are for people who do not watch them so eagerly, but this is only tedious. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is fun and moving, and the best way to do it usually is not to have all the fun parts in the first half of the movie and all the painful parts in the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Maybe it took a bit more depth than other Bollywood movies I've seen, but not much. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than at parties that were supposed to be funny. I did not shed a single tear or felt like it, instead, I was struck by the feeling of disgust with the attempt at a dramatic end. I do not recommend this movie if you want to watch something good, I recommend if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is kind of sad.
