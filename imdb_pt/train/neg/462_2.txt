This has to end up as one of the worst movies of all time. Terrible acting, horrible script ... and they were the positives! An a definite lack! The jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable they were pathetic. Pamela Anderson is still relying on her body to lessen the fact that her acting is so plastic! I sat there willing to take a chance, hoping it would get better, which did not happen! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you settle for good reading! I like Denise Richards, and that's why I gave this movie a try, but why she got carried away by this movie is beyond me!
