I'm not usually one to slate a movie. I try to see the positives and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you're going to do something so bad, why bother? Part of the film is shot with pictures of Anne's face as she takes a deep breath, and the violin music plays in the background. the other part is filled with poor quality and wood acting. Rupert Penry Jones is unimpressive. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern mannerisms. Anne is portrayed as being meek and selfish, which is good at first, but she stays the same throughout the film, and you see no reason for Captain Wentworth to fall in love with her. Overall, production has no concept of the period, with many mistakes to be overlooked, such as running away from the show, kissing on the street, running the streets without a hat (why was this scene in the movie really the scene of the book? More romantic scenes written. To summarize, a terrible movie, very disappointing.
