John Carradine, John Ireland and Faith Domergue who, as all players have seen better days in better movies, have teamed up for this Grade G horror movie about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion. For Carradine, it was in those In the last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory, it was better to continue working, no matter what you did, and receive those paychecks. With that magnificent sonorous voice of his, Carradine was always in great demand for images of terror and the man did not discriminate at all what he appeared. <br /> <br /> He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion that filmmaker John Ireland rented for his latest low-budget film. It even has a graveyard, but with one missing occupant. Faith Domergue is the aged star of Ireland and Carole Wells is the naive young woman. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, most of the cast ends up dead who are no longer dead. The script is so incoherent that I'm still trying to figure it out. I will not lose more gray matter in it.
