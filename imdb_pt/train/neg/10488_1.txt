Elvis left the building and was lucky because he did not have to watch this strange and bland. Scene-after-scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make a dull script even less fun. Filled with bland deaths, banal features and jokes, this movie is more desperate than fun. This is the kind of movie that makes it a hope that Kim Basinger follows Doris Day into a premature retirement. Let's remember her the way she was (talented) and not what she became. David Leisure, the delightful Dennis Richards and the rest are all wasted talents here. Zwick finds a way to minimize his talents at every turn. The guy who plays Elvis looks more like Gomer than the King. The only really good cast is the young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like her and is actually very good. The only other reason to watch this movie is to look for Tom Hanks' cameo. The cameo is not that funny, but at least it's not painful. One has to wonder if Zwick has Hanks's incriminating photos or something that would make him do this movie.
