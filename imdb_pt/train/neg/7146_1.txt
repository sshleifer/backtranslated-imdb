I registered just to make this comment (which virtually echoes some of those already here). The acting is worse than subpar, exposing common stereotypes, has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification (all without brains), and has some of the fuller lines known to man. <br /> <br /> including, but not limited to, "Okay, let's see what these guys can do." I should also mention that when they show accidents involving innocent civilians, you end up feeling bad about innocent people and start hating the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black people who only bother people. He may or may not be a good actor, but this movie does not allow this kind of character exploration. Do you want a movie that leaves the public on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. This movie makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience. <br /> <br /> Even cars can not make up for this movie. That Enzo that Griffin destroyed perfectly sums up this movie. Sucks.
