I was drawn to this movie, curious to see how they adapted Hubert Shelby's brutal romance. I thought a literary piece of such depth with a rich tapestry of characters, horrible situations and social criticism could not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is a terrible movie experience, not for its content, but for its shape. The director Ulrich Edel executes, in my honest opinion, a bad management job that does not do justice to the original book. No wonder Edel is a TV director; this movie looks and looks like a bad movie "made for TV". Some of my thoughts on this bomb (** spoilers ahead **): - Lack of creativity in the direction. The scenes are slow, seem slow, seem poorly filmed and almost never move from an anchored position. The only freedom they assume is in cinematography, with a beautiful dark tone. Other than that, the film has the same technical creativity as a TV soap opera. <br /> <br /> All actors do a great job portraying these miserable characters. The problem is that the adaptation does not address a basic element in the development of the plot: MOTIVATION. All these characters move like robots, without a clear motivation for their action. They seem to do things out of nowhere, like robots, for no reason at all. Edel loses all opportunities to enrich the character's development, not exploring the character's motivations, and avoiding to develop the personality of each character in all its extension. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is evident in Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job of playing this useless prostitute, but her decision to let the sailors rape her is not explained. It sounds extremely stupid, because we see this character doing it out of nowhere. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The movie also has many minor characters who do nothing, feel nothing and add nothing to the plot. I'd like to know more about Harry's wife, for example, and the interaction between the two. This is another missed opportunity. Edel only approached the character's development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, only to screw it all up in the end, not clearly explaining - again - his motivations. Bandits are also a joke in their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever experienced. Terrible job by Mark Knopfler. I really expected more from the former Dire Straits leader, but his work on this film is seriously lacking. At times, as in the battle between the syndicalists and the police, the music seems totally disconnected from the film. It also seems completely poor and anachronistic; I could swear that the whole soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It distracts the real action. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of Desmond Nakano's book is so literal that it eliminates the sense of history. It's as if they tried so hard to keep the action-by-action storyline in the book, that they forgot to actually develop the characters and, once again, explain their actions and motivations. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie, not even to a Shelby fan, because it can ruin the original book. It is a very uninspired effort to adapt the novel and shows very little creative contribution.
