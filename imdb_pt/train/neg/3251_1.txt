I got this movie on FX last night, and while sitting there watching, it occurred to me that it could possibly be the worst movie of all time. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad sound, totally unbelievable fighting sequences, stupid characters. All of this made it the most ridiculously bad movie I have ever seen. It was so bad, I was charmed by the lack of something semi-competent that I had to keep watching ... and they did a continuation!
