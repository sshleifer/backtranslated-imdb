I gave it a 2 only because Natassia Malthe (like the vampire Quintana) looks soooo sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Surely there is very little logic in this movie, but most of the science fiction vampires also Movements The movie probably tried too hard to break away from the traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far and made the whole story not just irrational, but ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of horrible things and a lot of out-of-body scenes that made me feel bad. A good vampire movie must be wiser than you do not need to see much blood - we all know that when a vampire jumps on a human he will do what a vampire will do. Some moans or screams are all that is needed to describe the scene (as in the end, when Quintana tries to raise Rosa sexually, all she needs is a few moans, the rest is her imagination). Anyway, it's just my personal taste.
