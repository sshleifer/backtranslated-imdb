The beginning of this movie is excellent, with a tremendous sound and good humor, but once the film turns into animation, it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons that led me was, at least for me, that the colors in much of the animation are very smooth, with very little contrast. Does not look good, at least on VHS. From time to time, it appears and looks great, but not often. Also, the characters come and go too fast. For example, I wish I had seen more of "Moby Dick". When the movie begins to drag, however, it picks up again with the dragon's entrance and then the movie ends strong. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last twelve years.
