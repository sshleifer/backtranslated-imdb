Sometimes doing something strange and contemporary does not always work to the advantage of everyone. Although I admit that the setting and concept of the film were quite interesting, running those ideas into a congruent story simply did not work. This movie was so horribly slow and meaningless, not even Robin Williams could save this crap. It is obvious that Barry Levinson's dream fell flat on the floor, but he should have warned the rest of the world about this problem.
