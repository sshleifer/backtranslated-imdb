This is a film that tries to tell the story of Thailand, set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was along the lines of many Thai films that I watched and enjoyed, one that has Thai actors talking Thai madness and martial arts. Well, it's nothing like that. This film is filmed entirely in English, is full of Anglo actors and has such terrible production values ​​that it's ridiculously bad ... but it's not funny! Who can blame this garbage? The acting, the dialogue and most sets were very bad. Some of the fight scenes seemed to have been choreographed by the local high school theater club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but some were just a cheap onscreen animation that provided a particularly extravagant effect. There's a great outdoor battle scene in epic style where a few thousand extras run through a field in costume, but when we see the two armies colliding in combat - HA! What a joke! The film has some beauties. Too bad they did not show a little more skin. At least that would have been something for the guys to enjoy. Do not bother yourself.
