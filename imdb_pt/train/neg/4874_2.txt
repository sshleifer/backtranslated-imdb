Too bad that neither Eddie Murphy nor the animals had anything to say that was worth saying. This movie is simply bland. <br /> <br /> The children's movie? Well, if you're trying to take a nap, then maybe. It's only 90 minutes of a lip animation of animals that irritates the eyes and are not funny. And lip sync makes the old Godzilla movies look brilliantly done in comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy talks to a choked up and underestimated childbirth that is painful to experience. Apparently, he's trying to modify his old maniac persona, but for what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original 1967 version is lost in this re-imagining, or whatever. A city wants to intimidate some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad things. Not even. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things come together with some rancid jokes for an uninspired conclusion and no surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent the 1967 movie. Or some old yogi bear cartoons.
