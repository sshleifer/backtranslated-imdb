This movie was ridiculously bad. A friend rented from Netflix and made me watch it. There are so many gaffes and jokes that it is impossible to bother to meet the characters and the plot. How about, for example ... <br /> <br /> "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben appears miraculously on a shirt during a telephone conversation <br /> <br /> < > priest's office palatial ... complete with a foldable card table table <br /> <br /> There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look beyond the technical flaws, you'll find horrible performances and castings. I was very impressed with the cast of an extravagant gay actor to play the right-wing religious fanatic brother. His opening scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, caressing his kitten, was hilarious. <br /> <br /> I applaud the writer / director / producer / editor / star / supplier / dentist / composer (and anything else he's done in this movement) to actually get a film like this distributed. If you have nothing better to do, it can be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game, but do not rent it for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
