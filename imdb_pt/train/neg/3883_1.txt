It's no joke. It was horrible. <br /> <br /> I was watching my local science fiction station last night, which plays movies, every night, within a monthly theme. This month is "Space Turkeys, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bombs". Movies so bad, they should never have been made. This was a good selection. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is completely horrible, with two exceptions, the gore makeup (which showed potential) and the editing (which came out slightly from the rest of the movie in terms of being awful). The acting is horrible around, the dialogue is horrible, the script, the direction. Not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two forms of special effects, gore and space images. I'll focus on the blood. Watching this movie, I thought to myself, "What was the motivation behind the production of this movie?" People like to do things, of course, but I was hesitant to think that something good could happen to everyone involved. I came to the conclusion that this movie was made to increase the Demo Reel of the Make-Up Effects guy. He (Rick Baker) made a great career, working on STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996) and THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981). other notable movements. Other than that, I can not say that I actually saw a real, living, melting man - incredible, or not - but I have to say that this seems to be a fair representation of one. <br /> <br /> Now, when I think of bad editing, I usually think of a scene where someone is talking on the phone and in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps to the shoulder, or something to that effect. This movie really serves to highlight the fact that bad editing can take many forms. Specifically, overly long and useless scenes. Almost every scene crawled more than it should, from a little dead air to that crazy screaming scene with Cleaver Girl. And that head cut in the river, head thrown in the river (in slow motion), the movie continues for a few minutes, and then we cut the floating head and watched it fall into a waterfall. While I'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head, what the heck? <br /> <br /> Finally, I'll mention the scene of the fat woman running / slow motion right near the beginning. The slow motion tells me that they did not originally shoot the slow-motion scene, but then they decided it was "not working" and then slowed down. Oy vey Anyway, if you see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hallway and then straight through a closed glass door - all in slow motion, remember - remember the AMAZING FUSION MAN, because * that * is where it all began. <br /> <br /> Movies like this are best viewed at home with a lot of friends. This is a bit slow most of the time, but that's even more time to create your own one-liners. Not the worst of the worst, but it's too bad.
