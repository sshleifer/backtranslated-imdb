If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you'll have this down. The film begins in gay and old England around 1100 and then jumps to present-day California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new security chief and military advisor to a science laboratory at 400 feet depth. He arrives (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the lead scientist and we soon discover that it is a cloning lab and they have something newly discovered to clone. Is it a dinosaur or what? As with the movies above, all hell breaks loose and our characters begin to be chosen. The special effects on Monster are very good for a "straight to the video" movie and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for. But forget the rest of the group when we find out why we've never seen them before. Again, do not go with high expectations and you will be fine.
