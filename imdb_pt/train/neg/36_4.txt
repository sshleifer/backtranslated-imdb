This movie looked very long even with only 75 minutes. The problem with horror movies in the jungle is that there are always too many scenes of people walking (through the forest, a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to keep track of the race time. It is worth seeing the film for the laughable Nubian zombie and naked with big bloody eyes, always accompanied in the soundtrack with much breathing and much reverberation. Eurotrash fans will be entertained with lousy dubbing in English, free female flesh and very silly make-up work on the monster and native extras. For a zombie / cannibal film, this was pretty light, but I probably did not see an uncut version.
