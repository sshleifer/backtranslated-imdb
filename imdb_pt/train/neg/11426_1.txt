Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do the movie's producers think they are? THE WORST ABSOLUTE, the most unrealistic movie I've seen since I remember. This movie is so bad that I felt compelled to sign up for IMDb and make sure the rating of this "movie" dropped. <br /> <br /> omg I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunken girl, so while she passes out I'm actually walking around my room for hours wondering frantically "What did I do ?!" Jesus heath, overcome and grow ... and I would like to convey that same sentiment to the idiot producers ... and while I'm at it, instead of this movie being a pathetic excuse for a story, maybe it would be more appropriate to focus the plot in a mentally unstable character. .. like his character called "lesbian" ... after all, I know the first time I did gay sex when I left the next morning I jumped into the sky in excitement in the middle of the street ... honestly b * tch, get a grip ... <br /> <br /> WHAT A PENNY! and please note that there are many many flaws and terribly stupid aspects in this lame movie, but I'm so tired of thinking about it. On the bottom line, if you're a smart person, you hate this movie, and if you're not a smart person then you'll love it ... it's as simple as that.
