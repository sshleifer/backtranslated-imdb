I did not like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80's, so I tried watching it again to see if my dislike of that movie was for my movie tastes in the 80's or was it "Stripes" is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is there and "Stripes" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Now, "Stripes" may have been an innovative comedy in the early 1980s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training. or who are the fans of Bill Murray, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mainly because "Stripes" is a comedy, but it's not so funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the film is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly complicated and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're accustomed to more contemporary comedies like "Anchorman," which strives to laugh everywhere in the movie. <br /> "Stripes" suffers even more with Bill Murray and Harold. Ramis's lack of capacity for action. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very attractive dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are not good enough as actors to carry the movie's dramatic arc. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy that exists in "Stripes" revolves around the intelligent, self-centered foundation of Bill Murray. Man-child character, so if you do not find the character funny (like I do not) you will not find most of the comedy that exists in "Stripes", too. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is much more a movie of its time, has not aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch a comedy "buddy" from the 80's, I would recommend "Stir Crazy". Like "Stripes," the humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes," it has aged a lot better and as a result, it's still watchable.
