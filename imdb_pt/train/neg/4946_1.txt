Of course, I watched this play with VERY low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is an untalented composer whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> This was the first cartoon film that I watched 100% humor free. He's rude, offensive, country-wise, and blatantly anti-woman. As such, it is a creation consistent with Bohlen, but the average viewer will be delayed for this. No wonder it has never been shown in a movie: it would have bombed BIG time! <br /> <br /> Not even the 6.5 MegaEuros expense was able to save this total crap. Save your time and money!
