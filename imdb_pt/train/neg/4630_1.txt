Launched in 1965, but clearly filmed years before, this is an ineffective little crime melodrama with inept sexual exploitation ahead. As usual for period films, there is a good deal of undressing and dressing up without reason complemented by bad music, boring narration and awkward editing. The coffee scene sets the excruciating grounds as we enter and leave the characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines. All we have are reaction photos for the character's off-screen voice! Beautiful 50-year-old Misty's Ayers strips French panties a few times before the action begins. She is continually accompanied by what appears to be stock music, from romantic to western to mother-to-do, randomly mixed to produce, among other things, the most electrifying cigarette lighting ever captured in the movies. See how it hits him! See how he attacks the match! Will he inhale or be captured by the Apaches? Only time will tell!! The film tells the sordid story of how Sally is taken to work in a brothel, falls in love with a drug and can not escape. For some reason, we are treated with some of the most bored and boring prostitutes who have ever committed to filming, literally doing their nails or knitting instead of entertaining the clientele. A stupidly lame comedy (alcoholic drink accidentally drinks milk! Har dee har!) And acting in the silent movies does not help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen, even on the Something Weird Video sign. It's really more of a movie curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema - very bad cinema.
