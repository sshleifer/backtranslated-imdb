Where to start? the special effects should be named special defects, when the director shouted "action", I think he also pointed out to the actors to perform the worst performance they could think. Perhaps he was upset with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not get back a single penny from their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make a movie. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family would not let him. <br /> <br /> The only certainty is that whoever employs him in the future is because he is in love with him (so his objectivity jumped out the window) or because he changed his name and erased all previous references.
