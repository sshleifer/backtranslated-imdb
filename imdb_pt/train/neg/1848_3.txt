There are bad movies, then there are movies that are so bad that they become almost art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I are still kind of shocked, you know, looking at space and drooling! You can tell that the people involved (I hope they changed their names to protect themselves) were having a blast, and they definitely were not shy. I give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous obscenity and REALLY bad effects. I laughed out loud for most of the movie, so I guess you could tell that it showed me a good time. Beware of the viewer, the above words by no means interpret that this is a good movie, because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass a movie with such a BIG title!
