The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $ 3.00 and the time passed by that bomb. The crewman in charge of continuity lost the boat. When the protagonist and the FBI guy went to the premises of the alleged killers, Mr. FBI handed the female a revolver. When the suspected killer came out the door, the revolver magically transformed into automatic. One is left to ponder whether an FBP agent would hand over a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It's a shame that the R-note did not allow much of it to be seen. It looks like a movie editor cut what could have been the best parts of the movie.
