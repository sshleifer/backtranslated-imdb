I love a good love story (and I'm a guy), but when I rented "Love Story" I prayed that the end would be as quick and painless as possible and just the opposite for the character of Ali McGraw. Ali McGraw as Jenny alienated and irritated the hell out of me in the first 15 minutes. When we discovered she was diagnosed with a fatal illness, I could not help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss to poor Oliver or whether anyone watching this movie would care. If she did not die, her personality would probably have pushed Oliver to the limit and eventually put them in the divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the '70s.
