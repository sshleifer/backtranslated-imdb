"Speedy Gonzalez," by Friz Freleng, was the second cartoon to feature as the title character in Robert McKimson's "Cat-tails for Two." In this cartoon, Speedy has been a small ugly creature with a large golden tooth, but by its second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. Despite appearing significantly nicer, Speedy never developed much of the character. A great hat, a tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not make a classic character and that is just about everything Speedy ever had for him. However, the arrogant mouse proved extremely popular and went on to perform in many short films, including some really abysmal films from the studio's final days. Although these short shorts are better than later atrocities, in which he was often (rather strangely) paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable jokes usually based on a similar pursuit formula. In this self-titled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other rats to steal cheese from them from the local factory, which happens to be kept by Sylvester the cat. Although he brings the extra weight of a star to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here could easily be filled by any other cat of generic design. His personality is undermined by his being forced into predictability. role of the persecutor. This has always been a problem in Tweety's cartoons, but Speedy makes an even more dull opponent, thanks to his obnoxious arrogance and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years. Despite following a very basic formula and with minimal laughter, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and a completely unworthy star was born.
