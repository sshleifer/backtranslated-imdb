I would not call it horrible, but nothing shines in this movie, and it's overwhelmed with a seriously unbelievable basic plot development. It starts well but once the main blow is done, it turns into a long subplot around a young woman who is not convincing, and some action scenes that are theater of the unrealistic absurd. For example, there is a prolonged shooting at the airport where the lighting is strobe. No explanation for that. How believable is that a storage area at the airport will have lights that blink and confuse, and just enough to let Snipes make his incredible getaway? This is one of the few action scenes punctuated by unnecessarily drawn set ups that fail to attract the belief of suspension. <br /> <br /> In addition, the whole premise seems to be that the CIA team of the United States can shoot the spot, but go away saying "national security" to the English. This trick depends on a stereotype that is far removed from reality to be satisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are much better action movies out there. Better formulated, better executed. This is fun at times but there simply is not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring - something that should never happen in a good action movie.
