Wow ... what would you do with 33 million dollars? Let me give you a choice; you can: a) tear it and throw it in the toilet or b) make a movie based on the premise of Whoopi Goldberg as a futuristic cop with a rubber dinosaur using terms like "I do not beat trumpet" and Sopra raspberries with base on which this is funny. That's right, you would choose the option that has more merit - collapse in the toilet. <br /> <br /> This has to be seen to be believed. I can not even find the words to describe how bad this movie is. It does not even fit into the "so bad - it's good" category. I actually have it on television as I write - and while watching I felt the need to come to the IMDb and register my disgust. <br /> <br /> Considering Jurassic Park was made a couple of years earlier, how on earth did they think the public would tolerate another man dressed in a rubber suit? The WG should have simply walked and condemned the consequences. Everyone involved goes to hell for this criminal waste of money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm about to implode.
