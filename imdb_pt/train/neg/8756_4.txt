Russell Hopton played in many movies until his death in 1945. He only directed 2 and "Black Gold" was one (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence but in this he was playing a good child. He was obviously quite popular on the "quickie" circuit - he made so many movies. In this, he plays the son of an old oil maker who is convinced that he will hit the oil very soon. J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell, since he knows there will be oil at any moment. A geologist, Henry, comes on the scene and helps the father of "Fishtail". He also convinces "Fishtail" to attend school regularly. Henry has his eye on Cynthia, the beautiful teacher. This was the last Gloria Shea movie - she began her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). The "Fishtail" father is killed when the spacecraft is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson attempts to persuade Fishtail to sell his oil rent. It all goes well with the oil being hit and "Fishtail" going to military school. <br /> <br /> All right for a rainy day.
