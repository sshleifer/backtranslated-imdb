Watching pretty women sneaking around, playing cops and thieves is one of the most pleasurable guilty pleasures the average movie allows me to enjoy. So The House on Carroll Street was not a waste of time, although the story is invented and the script is not inspired and somewhat annoying. <br /> <br /> There are many allusions to different Hitchcock photos, not least Kelly's choice. McGillis in the lead role. She's dressed like Grace Kelly, and she's not far from the truth. Not at all. But your character is not convincing. The way it is presented to the public, it must be someone with political convictions and purpose in life. After all the film deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific problem. But the story degenerates in the first few minutes in a story of uncontrolled crime with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is even more regrettable, as the actors' performances are good, as well as photography and scenery. <br /> <br /> The end of Central Station in New York is breathtaking. It starts in the underground section and then climbs to the roof. The film can be praised for its good use of architecture.
