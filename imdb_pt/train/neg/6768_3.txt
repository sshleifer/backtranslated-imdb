Herbie, Volkswagen who thinks like a man, is back, now being driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman hoping to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing that stands in their way is the defending champion, Murphy Trip (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original bug was not so good. Even as a child, I remember not liking it very much. I had some hope for continuation. I mean, the cast is really good and the trailer makes it look like a really fun movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better now than before. The film is defiantly weak for people over 12 years old. It will probably entertain the kids, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I realize it's a kid's movie and everything, but they could have made the film a little more interesting. There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. Most of the actors seemed dead in their roles as well. Lindsay Lohan was just as well as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance of all. He was very good as the bad guy, although he did not have much to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and they do not do anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson drives and she does a good job. She tries to keep the film interesting, but she is working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and would it be a surprise to you that they too were responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films, but they can not really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not entirely their fault, but hopefully next time they will try harder. In the end, Herbie is a safe and predictable family movie that is worth watching if you are a child. Everyone is better to ignore it. Overall Rating 4/10
