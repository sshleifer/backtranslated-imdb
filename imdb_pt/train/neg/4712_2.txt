This show is possibly the biggest, ugliest and most generic of the steam blocks I've seen on kids programming that really became a hit. The main character, Johnny, though I understand he represents an ordinary child, is neither pleasant nor tolerable. The jokes are ragged, exaggerated (that is, the phrase "Whoa! I did not see it coming." It was not funny at the first time, it's not at all cute) and it lacks any form of sagacity or primitive inspiration. And finally ... it's just ugly to look at. Although children are not especially critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eye drops. I can not stand watching the show, because in a way, the art style is simply ... disgusting. Horrible, actually. Just plain crummy. <br /> <br /> I just can not stand that this is gaining a lot of time in the air. Although I understand that nostalgia can be a bit irrational and I should not be expecting it to come back ... I really miss the old cartoons. Bring back Dexter's Lab, The Powerpuff Girls ... anything but this crap. I guess it's just wishful thinking though. <br /> <br /> Put simply, I advise you not to waste your time on this show. I believe that really good cartoons can be enjoyed by the big kids as well. And that does not solve.
