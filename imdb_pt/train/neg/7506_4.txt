Good actors and good performances can not mask a meaningless script, bad dialogue, and spiraling behavior patterns in anything you care about. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No development of character - no growth, no interest, only some suffering for no particular reason, teaching us nothing and not even bothering to entertain.
