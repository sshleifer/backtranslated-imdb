I have seen this recently and I must say that I was moved by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a movie did not work well. However, I look forward to watching the documentary that the producers who organized this project did because I think it would be a much more attractive job than this movie. <br /> <br /> The international cast was composed of B- class actors, but their acting was appropriate, and I must give special mention to the young actress who played Holly. This was her first film role and she did a great job considering that part of her is the most challenging. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was fit but bland as Patrick, the American whose mission is to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good in that final role. Unfortunately, despite my overwhelmingly positive view of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both actors were very forgettable and did their best work in this film. <br /> <br /> I believe in the message and intent of the film, but I have to be fair, so I classify "Holly" 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie. But I think the subject deserves to be seriously considered and I am pleased that the people behind this film have made a documentary that I hope to have their debut on the BBC and on other TV networks.
