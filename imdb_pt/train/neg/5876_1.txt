I had to compare two versions of Hamlet to my Shakespeare class and, unfortunately, I chose this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of the speech directly in the camera) to the camera photos (all medium or large photos ... without scenery photos and very little background in the photos) were absolutely terrible. I watched this during my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel like I was cheated for 114 minutes of my vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.
