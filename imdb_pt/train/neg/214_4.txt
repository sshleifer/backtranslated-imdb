Considering that this film had a serious and very successful launch campaign, I would have expected something worthwhile ... from the opening scene (in which the two brothers "sensually" caress one another, lying naked on a bed) it goes quickly down ... nothing to get attention, it's not a thing that holds the attention throughout the plot, baaad baad acting (some minor exceptions, but the artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script does not look at either in depth (remember that a possible excuse from creators, saying that they point to a subtle film would be hilarious, unless subtle and shallow meant the same thing. ..). Very curious viewers will not have any interesting scene ... at this point, they could have saved some of the movie ... so you can imagine how bad it is. Many other things could be said ... but please watch the movie yourself ... I'm selfish and I wish as many people as possible wasted about 1 1/2 hours of their lives ... like I did :(
