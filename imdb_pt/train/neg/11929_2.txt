I had watched "The Eye" before watching this. I really liked "The Eye", it was one of the best movies of recent Asian horror movies. So, I chose this "haunted Bangkok" because it was the same director, and it was kind of a popular round here. But man, what a disappointment ... "Haunted Bangkok" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. which are not scary, not even disturbing (like "The Eye" was) ... nothing. I can not even fill in the 10 lines needed for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% annoying. <br /> <br /> * My fee: 2/10
