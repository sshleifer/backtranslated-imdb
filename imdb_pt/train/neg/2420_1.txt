I usually comment only on movies I like, imagining "everyone to your liking", but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this movie, which somehow seems to get lost in the confusion, is that these self-centered adults have the perfect right to go to Vegas, get drunk, get married, and inflict incalculable suffering on their respective groups of people. children. Even allowing for culturally sanctioned inebriation, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they set in motion. After all, "love" is all that is important, is not it? To hell with everyone. If things "work out in the end," it's not really the point; in fact, it is quite irrelevant. The point is that disrespect by others, especially if they are young, and especially if they are in a position of dependence, is despised and reinforced by this film. There are many more innocuous behaviors these "fathers" could have carried out that would knock an army of social workers into their heads in the blink of an eye.
