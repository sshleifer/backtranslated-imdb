As you may or may not have heard, there is no real fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. One can then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but it really is appropriate because nothing else about that movie made any sense. There was absolutely no story or plot, just things happening. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than the safeauto bad commercials. <br /> <br /> Not only was there no fight between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with even zombies in it. Her makeup looked as if it was applied by an 8 year old girl. The scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting zombies with a hedge trimmer (I'm not kidding), but they used chainsaw sound effects. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly the poorest movie I have ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not totally ridicule every person responsible for the production of this movie is if I knew that it was produced entirely by 11 year olds. <br /> <br /> Really, even with all the criticisms I offer here, I suggest watching this movie exclusively based on the fact that it may well be the worst movie ever, and by this is quite comical. Even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained.
