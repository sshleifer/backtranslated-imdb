Words can not describe how abysmal this movie is. It's a random series of random clips, everything from a stupid Batman parody to a guy who's wearing a dead (REALLY disturbing) old woman. The only remotely entertaining thing about Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. In addition, it is rated NC-17, avoiding the only people who can tolerate this.
