This movie is a good example of how through the manipulation of the media you can sell a movie that is no more than a very bland TV comedy. In Puerto Rico, the daily paper of greatest circulation wrote continuously on the wonders of this film, almost silencing all the others. Coincidentally, the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that analyzed the form and content of the film and pointed out all its flaws, cliches and bad texts. Just because a movie is part of the audience laughing with easy and obvious jokes, and because you can recognize actors and scenarios, does not make it an acceptable movie.
