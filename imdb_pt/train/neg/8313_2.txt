I watched it on a whim because it was available and I had heard that the Thumb movies were funny. This was not it. Most of the jokes were based on the physique of "Geranium" and, in turn, the one of Kate Winslet. I think it's really pathetic for the creators of the "Thumbtanic" to go down so hard to make jabs into a respected actress just because she (heaven forbid) does not starve in the model of ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the phrase that says, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim to that impromptu raft no one else seems to see!" Thirty seconds of fun in a 26-minute movie does not pay off.
