What do you call a horror story without horror and history? This is the most annoying thing in the movie: I get the impression that the writers never really decided what's really going on in the movie! It's a different thing to know it, give tips to the public and not reveal it completely, but here, you have the feeling that the writers do not know this, the characters in the movie do not know it and the public sees that nobody knows ! (Remember "Cube"? Even though the movie knew more about itself). <br /> <br /> I've consumed a lot of horror / gore movies of the '80s, and this movie certainly has its roots deep in these films. But many important things are missing. We really do not know anything about the characters. They keep repeating empty lines over and over again. The story is not really developing - it's never going anywhere. B-acting is good at this type of horror movie, but there is not much to be done in the script. We do not care about the characters. There is nothing to remember about them. There is not even extravagant humor or unnecessary sex. And most important - no emotions, no shivers. <br /> <br /> You only have some elements commonly used in the horror movie genre. They show the Lordi monsters one by one, but their characters do not really contribute anything to the story. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that this amount of story, character development and atmosphere could be achieved with a minimal amount of crew. and equipment. Oh yes, the filmmakers used to do that - and more - 20 years ago! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience when the film ended. Too bad indeed.
