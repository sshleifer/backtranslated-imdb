I think the biggest disappointment in this movie was that by the end I expected the casting instructors to step in and apologize for how poor the acting was. When you consider the powerful subject, the brilliant scenery, and the effort made to create wonderful scenery and spectacular images, it is a shame that little attention has been paid to acting. <br /> <br />
