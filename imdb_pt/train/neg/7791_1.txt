I saw the original German version not dubbed and I was surprised at how bad this movie really is. Thinking I'd seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and such, nothing could have prepared me for that! It really was a pain to sit through this movie, since there is no plot, there is no good acting and even the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, wearing nothing more than white makeup and their old clothes, so its good set would not be ruined by patches of ketchup and marmalade. <br /> <br /> If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then watch, for everyone else, do not do this because you will be sorry!
