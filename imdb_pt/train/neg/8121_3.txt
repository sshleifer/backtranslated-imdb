Time is precious. This movie is not. I need to learn to ignore critics who are enthusiastic about small movies like Fargo and this complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was crowded and everyone came out with the same reaction: is this the movie that the critics are talking about? What crap! <br /> <br /> The hook of this film is the rising black daughter, looking for her white trash family. Get it? <br /> <br /> The acting is superb. <br /> <br /> The production (lighting, scenery, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minute story. The characters are superficial and unintelligent. I was insulted that these people could not find out what was obvious to the public; the audience was whispering to the movie screen what the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I had more fun washing my clothes.
