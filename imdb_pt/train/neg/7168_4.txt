The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the plot's execution took him too far from the film to the point of making it almost unattainable. Basic elements like character development were hidden, at best. Inconsistencies have also created their ugly heads. A huge mansion in the middle of the Irish countryside? Characters just "popping" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, should I add)? All in all it was not "bad". I ranked a 4, based mostly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott.
