Let's make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show! Well, if this idea does not intrigue you, which should not, stay away from the ringmaster. I had the dislike to see this in the theater and really be able to sit with this movie mess. I think Jerry Springer does not interpret himself as does the cheap props for his show (yes, it seems even cheaper than the actual Jerry Springer show) and he is known only as Jerry in the movie. The plot (if you can call it that) is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with her mother's boyfriend live. So the brilliant idea of ​​Mom is to call Jerry Springer's show as well as start with her daughter's boyfriend. (It's some coincidence that they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile, somewhere else in America, a woman finds her betraying the man with her friend in bed together. So, of course, call the American therapist, Jerry Springer! I'd talk about the rest of the movie, but even thinking about the movie right now is giving me a headache. Jamie Pressly, who plays the daughter, seems totally uninteresting in the film. And remember Michael Dudikoff, the master of the ass karate of the American series of ninjas? Well, take a look at it now like drunken white trash. The thing is he really looks very awful and out of shape to call him "get in touch with your charecter". But if your idea of ​​fun is to see Jerry Springer singing a country song about his own show or guys connecting with transvestites ... well ... JUST WATCH THE SHOW ONCE! ... at least Steve was smart enough to stay out of that movie.
