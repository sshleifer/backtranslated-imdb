I just watched American Pie: Beta House and I have to say, this was a pile of crap. The first 3 American Pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. <br /> <br /> As you discovered in the movie title, Beta House, it's about a fraternity, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of all, falling in love. Of course, the guy who has his way with the puppies is Stifler, who, along with his companions, tries to complete another seemingly impossible task. It was unreal and super fake. It is simply predictable and the plot is so weak. Both sides of the college battle to see who gets the whole thing (something like that) To sum up: acting horrible + dull script + misuse of the American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This movie is unbearable. I give her two out of ten, though most of it sucks, there was a lot of nudity and pretty girls, like two funny scenes :)
