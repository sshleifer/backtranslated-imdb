I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Donner performed with mastery. I'm not alone in disdaining Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... which brings us to Richard Donner's cut of the same film, unfortunately it's still an absolute abomination. <br /> <br /> The world of Superman is one in which the suspension of disbelief is necessary in strong doses, but Superman 2 extends things very far. It does not matter who directed Superman 2 because the screenplay insults the intelligence of a first-grader. In a way, there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do, unlike the original superman. With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is treated in the least believable way. There is much to criticize, so I will not bother. I condemn this film ... maybe the slapstick in Lester's version is more appropriate for the idiomatic script on which this film is based. Super-Duper is bad.
