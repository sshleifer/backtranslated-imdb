Please note that I have not seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not carry. However, I really want to say something about it. I'm actually doing a research for the university about the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and I would like to point out that the person on which they based the main character was in reality completely different !!! The Hollywood ideas about people and artistic licenses granted, the true dr. Bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women, and would never have practiced anything as liberal as depicted in the film. I find it ridiculous to see several movie critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say that this movie has some historical basis! The only real fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please do not waste your time on a movie with such contempt for horror that real women have experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry.
