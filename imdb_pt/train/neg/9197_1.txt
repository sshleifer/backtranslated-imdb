There are some movies that you know they will be bad at frame one. Even if you were totally oblivious to Ed Wood's work, take a look at that commentator on "Plan 9 from outer space" and you just KNOW that you will not see the next film masterpiece. So when I saw the first scene of Uwe Boll's masterpiece "House of Dead," with that guy sitting in front of the house beginning his introduction as he tried desperately to sound like he'd just come from Sin City, the movie begins like this - first the main character says that everyone is going to die. You know, to keep him wandering. Then he starts presenting the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma ... thinks she's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia..my ex ... we've just finished ... I had to study and she had to surround" . No, I'm not joking. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this bunch of 20-somethings who could not get out of a wet paper bag are going to the "Rave of the Century," rave. in question, are some tents, a potty-holder and a poor-quality stage located on the small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but fortunately will find a way to get there, the way to be a fishing boat ran by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, who wrote this script is a genius) and his companion who is a bastard son of Cpt McAllister of the Simpsons and that killer of hooks who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> To shorten the story, the gang arrives on the island, finds no one there, except for some T-shirts and T-shirts. then decide to run away from here. No, wait, they do not, they really get all happy and like it, because there's free drinking. <br /> <br /> With this scene, the film reaches the bottom of the pit and then, against all odds, continues to the descent. Some guys in rubber suits start running, there are some screams and shots, our gang goes to some house to meet another gang, they leave the house, they meet Cpt Kirk and a police woman (who among them has about 500 pounds) of arms) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line they turn into a S.W.A.T. Team, get into the Matrix, the guys in the rubber suit start to multiply like bacteria and I start to cry because I actually paid to see it. To add insult to injury, every few minutes, there are video game shots that this crap is based on and there is a beautiful game scene for some characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. It does not even fit the famous category "So bad it's good." It's just bad. The script is bad, the zombies are terrible, there is no tension, the lines are bad, the actors are bad ... the list goes on. <br /> <br /> You will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being horrible. No. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.
