I've been using IMDb for years and never wanted to get involved in the movie review so far. This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I am not a Muslim, nor an expert in Islamic studies, but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious one-sided view this documentary holds. <br /> <br /> The problems with this movie start with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries I've seen anchor themselves on some valid points, and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and disinformation. This is surely the case with Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists all over the world, and some of them are Muslim, but building a documentary on all of Islam around a small percentage of the radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This is really a documentary on the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who would like to explore more objectively some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are several points that may help. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside the region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Koran used in the documentary is questionable. I watched the documentary while watching the other translation and the differences were impressive. I had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that the Surrah says the unbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I have is: "Those who reject the Truth between the People of the Book and among the polytheists will be in the fire of hell." The difference is that those who reject the Truth are those people who know about God and the Truth of God and decide to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The film mentioned that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but this is not true. While it is true that much comes from the Qur'an and the Hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called "Urf or normative behavior." Obviously, what is normative can be interpreted in a number of ways, but "Urf is a" good "behavior, what an ordinary person would consider right or wrong. The documentary features Shar'ia (Islamic Law) as a unified body of knowledge that all Muslims follow. This is simply not true. There are many Islamic law schools and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret the law. <br /> <br /> The Hadith tradition is similar. There are thousands of Hadiths and each law school accepts some and rejects others. Using Hadith without a serious scholarship to determine which are accurate, real, and applicable, is it indiscriminately to choose and choose quotes from the story that fit what you want to say? That's what the documentary did. <br /> <br /> What I expect people to realize is that fundamentalism is the problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot doctors at abortion clinics and so on. I know this is not the same as a suicide bombing, just understand that the justice of fundamentalism is undoubtedly the problem. If you think you have the answer, everyone must be wrong. But if you think you have an answer, you can work together with other people's views on politics, religion, God, or whatever.
