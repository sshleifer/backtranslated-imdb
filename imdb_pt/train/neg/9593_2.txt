Judging from some of the comments on IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps dramatic or stupid or simple or comic, but essentially an action movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever I watched, it certainly did not look like a movie. The story is simple and straightforward (even if the prologue tries to make it seem complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) government 2) the rebels 3) a group of killers. <br /> <br /> Now subtract the first one (they never appear in the movie). So simply let one of the murderers, the princess, become a rogue on a journey of revenge. Add a rebellious love interest with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still have not been able to turn it into a story or a movie. Between some random action sequences and some strange visuals trying to be Sci-Fi on a low budget, what remains is a feeling of emptiness. The film does not look like a movie, but a strange, incoherent and boring dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
