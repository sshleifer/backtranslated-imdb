I grew up spilling over the intertwined stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across his son sitting on a big couch reading A Winkle in Time, and he would think, what an incredible movie that would do. Unfortunately, the screenwriter failed, changing character, playing a bit of humor and destroying the plot. I know it's a difficult task to turn a beloved romance into a movie. But why can not you stay faithful to the book? Why should you change the way the characters think and act? For those of you who have not read the book, grab it, find a soft sofa and let your imagination run wild.
