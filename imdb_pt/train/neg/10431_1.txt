I loved the first season. The quality dropped a bit in the second season, which however had a great medium (Pegasus!). The third season was quite new and original and it was OK. The fourth season began to fall quickly because they never started giving us explanations when we were really starting to need them now. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was Angel-Kara's goal to lead the fleet to devastate Earth-1? What kind of past the last five Cylons did they have, and how did they survive or were they reincarnated? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. <br /> <br /> And then comes the end. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. It's all right. But destroying the fleet? Giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life, and spreading thousands of people all over the planet? This is not just anti-science, it's anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle that goes from the romanticism of nature to a decaying capitalist society inventing destructive AI. which spoils everything. It is without vision, without hope of a greater future for humanity, and is antithetical to the science fiction itself. And do not even tell me about the angels! Religious claptrap of the worst kind! The final disappointment !! <br /> <br /> The whole "all this has happened before and will happen again" must have related to the previous incarnation of the series, not just to Earth as we know it. To make the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive blow of the genius. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10.
