I saw a lot of crap in my day, but my God, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free exhibit in NY the other night. I can only hope they show the funny version to paying customers. The laughter was scarce, the plot was uninteresting, and the characters were one-dimensional at best. One highlight is a hilarious dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was invaluable and it was the only scene I really had a healthy laugh. Other than that, I can only remember randomness and dead air. SNL and Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I was expecting more of this. But it's short, I definitely would not recommend watching a free exhibition or paying to watch this movie.
