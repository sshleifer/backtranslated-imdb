Tedious girls-at-reform-school flick, which plays a bit like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is trapped there after running away from her abusive father. Once in de facto jail, she is raped by her "inmate" companions. <br /> <br /> Overlong (even at 98 minutes), with a totally meaningless ending that makes the whole film seem pointless. Linda Blair, 15, does her best to avoid showing off her body when she's naked, but lets a nipple slip during a bath scene. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *** *
