I still have to read a negative professional review of this movie. I think I must have missed something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories. That's the best part. After the three follow separate paths, the film is divided into three segments. This is where boredom sets in. Of course, the discussion with the Fushiniesque babushkaas who make dolls with chewed bread is at first a curiosity to open their eyes. Unfortunately, the director defeated this one to death, even injecting a wild plot that leads nowhere in particular. In short: an indifference of two hours of plot. If you suffer from insomnia, see her in bed and have a good night's sleep.
