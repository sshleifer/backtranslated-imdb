No word can describe my total hatred for this shocking version of BTK killer. Rate this movie one in ten compliments of this truly disastrous excuse for a movie. From start to finish, there was not a single highlight. The whole thing was horribly put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. Several scenes are literally funny, by the atrocious way in which the whole thing is mounted. This review may seem like an unfair and forceful attack on a low-budget film, but that's not the case. Just thinking of the movie I just saw, my blood starts to boil. As this film has never been granted production rights I will never know. I am almost tempted to really recommend the BTK because it is really a highlight in relation to how pathetic and disturbingly horrible it is. I can honestly say that in all my years of filming, this is the WORST. MOVIE. EVER. I wasted more than an hour of my life on this useless junk, and would be glad to leap from the nearest building beforehand if I knew what I was looking for. ZERO out of ten.
