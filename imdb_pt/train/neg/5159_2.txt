Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue. Initially sounds great but ultimately offers no satisfaction - none at all. <br /> <br /> The plot is a messy mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So how is it possible with this basic plot and Robin Williams that the movie still ends so badly ?! It's because the image is all appearance without any substance - much like the terrible Popeye photo that Williams did early in his film career. The movie must have cost a fortune, but there might not have been enough money to hire writers who graduated from high school. <br /> <br /> The film is a boring joke that goes on and on. I'm really not sure why it was done in the first place - it certainly was not meant to provide any kind of entertainment.
