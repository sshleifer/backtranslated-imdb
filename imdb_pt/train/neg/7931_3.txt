The explosion of TV channels must be eternally grateful to the Randolph Scott Western production line, because at any one time there must be one of Randolph Scott's 100 films playing at least one station with no budget. "Man Behind The Gun" is a typical 50's melodrama with pre-World War II production values ​​that draws on a historically mysterious plot of action-packed murder to disguise the character's complete lack of development and therefore lack of suspense. In the coming years, the role of these films would be taken over by TV shows like 'Gunsmoke', 'Bonanza', etc. - and these really did the job better. Randolph Scott, looking particularly grizzled at this, is the good guy, fighting the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail. There's no more interest in what he's going through emotionally than in what your horse is feeling, unless you're wondering if he's going to sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end. Music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the "characters" than the action. But that's okay if that floats your boat; and I would not blame you for liking 'Diagnosis, Murder', or. <br /> <br /> Workmanlike, pedestrian and aging fast. 3 stars for being competently together; 0 for artistic endeavor.
