I watched the Malayan movie "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an English film of the same name) a long time ago. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is patently told, the classic jokes replaced by routines that are found in normal Hindi movies (probably the director did this to suit the taste of the Hindi audience) ... < I did not see the original in English. But he had really enjoyed Malayalam's film (made by Priyadarshan himself), which was a stalwart comedy at the time. Of course, the acting of Mohanlal, Mukesh, and Sukumari (who played the role of cook) was so natural and spontaneous. <br /> <br /> Probably, I'm very passionate about the Malay movie that I can not tolerate even the small flaws of his Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham were exaggerated. Paresh Rawal did a decent job - but he does not even come close to Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But okay, if you compare it with other recent Hindi comedy movies.
