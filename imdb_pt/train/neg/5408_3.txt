THIS REVIEW IS MORE ALL SPOILERS. If you plan to enjoy this movie, do not read this review. <br /> <br /> That's the problem with toddler TV nowadays. It's all so patronizing and condescending. 'Wow, that was fun, was not it? ' No, it was not. And unfortunately it seems to permeate into children's films too. And that's what 'Flight of the Reindeer' is all about. Admittedly, I have not seen 'Flight of the Reindeer' in a few years, so I may get confused at some points, but I remember being completely indifferent to it at the time. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story follows a teacher who receives a book for Christmas. Now the speaker is an estimated scientist on the flight habits of some animals. I think it was frogs. Anyway, through this book, Mr. Speaker / family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bull frogs. Apparently, this book was written by a scientist for hundreds of years who disappeared at the North Pole. Now, if it were me, I would have thrown the book out the nearest window. Flying toad is a natural phenomenon, but the flying reindeer is a fantastic concept and totally unreal. But, Mr. Professor, I am not myself, so I think this explains why he decides to fly to the North Pole leaving his wife and son at home with no idea where he went. Of course, things go wrong and, before he realizes it, a flying reindeer crashed into his private plane and he is stranded at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? Good. <br /> <br /> His family, of course, is devastated. I would be, I mean, Christmas sucked. Elsewhere, the professor finds himself in a hidden city at the North Pole, inhabited by dwarves and a tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white. Instead of trying to get away immediately, as I would have done, he greets everyone with open arms. This hidden civilization of dwarven monsters, and he receives them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy They feed this story that they are Santa's elves and spend all year making toys for kids that they have no idea they exist. And the teacher accepts all this. He even accepts that Santa is indeed the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or something. There is only one problem - they do not want it to go away. The world can not know of its secret existence. After all, before they knew it, there would be a McDonalds and a Starbucks around every corner. Still with me? <br /> <br /> Now, the cool guy's family finds the book and assume it's gone to the North Pole. Boy, would not they be ashamed if they found out that he had just taken a quick walk? Before the public knows, they are leaving to spend Christmas in the most authentic of the winter wonders of the planet. Meanwhile, the teacher talks about all the arrogant dwarfs and decides to leave. I do not remember exactly, but I remember him holding Santa Claus with a gun. A firefight follows when the dwarves attack and he manages to escape through Santa's sleigh. With Santa at his heels and bloodthirsty in his eyes, Mr Whatever, through a wonderful coincidence, finds himself flying beside the plane of his family who is looking for him. Then he jumps onto the plane, the planes fly back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The fact is that there have been some shocking movies made in the name of Christmas over the years, but because they have that festive charm they escape with it. And it is this charm that is totally devoid of "Rena's Flight" There is not much wrong with that; nothing that offends intelligence (well, of course, there is, but it's a kid's movie and so can get on with those things) or anything particularly offensive, but the problem is there's nothing right about that either. It just does not feel like Christmas. And for a movie that's about Christmas, it's a big flaw. But hey, I do not think the target audience for the "Flight of the Race" cares about this? Why should they? They're so doped with sedatives they probably could not spell 'Christmas' <br /> <br /> I give three out of ten. If it was a TV movie, I would add two more stars to it. We all know how bad they can get.
