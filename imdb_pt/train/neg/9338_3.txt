Pam Grier stars as Coffy. She is a nurse seeking revenge on the drug dealers who made her sister get addicted to bad heroin. As in any 1970s Blaxploitation movie, you can expect to see the racist malicious guys get their just desserts. There were dozens of these films made during the '70s, and they were really humiliating to both the black and white audiences. This is mainly due to the cruel racial hostility in these films and to the stereotyped and degrading characters. Especially the female characters. Other common topics between Coffy and other films of their kind include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous bounty of nudity, and beautiful, sex-crazy women. Not to mention the urban ghettos populated by drug traffickers, pimps, gangsters and other criminals. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier, was the undisputed queen of the Blaxploitation heroines of the 70s. She was magnificent, being tough and beautiful. As in other films, Pam beats the other characters in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen that these types of movies are unattainable without her as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you'd better watch your other films, like Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These movies have much less empty sleaze than Coffy. Pam's character in Coffy degrades too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films do not bow down to take revenge, as did Coffy. <br /> <br /> I'd say, just watch Coffy if you can not see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes Coffy's view bearable.
