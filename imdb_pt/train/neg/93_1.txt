A woman asks for advice on the road to a mysterious city, and she hears two macabre stories from the local bizarre, both zombie-related. But maybe fate has something nasty in store for her too ... <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I must confess, it was so bad that I was quickly routed through most of the junk. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It works for only 69 minutes and there's still tons of stuffing. You get a skinhead doing lots of push-ups, lots of boring little kissing scenes between the silly teenagers (rhyming, tee hee) and some good examples of why some people should never become actors. <br /> <br /> For the title characters, they barely have a footnote in the movie. Why, you get more undead in the introduction than you do in the previous feature! However, considering how pathetic the eye exploding in the orbits and the brain-eating sequences are (among other "delights"), perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And on top of that, it seems like it was filmed on someone's cell phone to be broadcast on Youtube. Cameras, scratches on the print, flickering lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized it was made in 2001, not 1971. Even the clothes and the fashion look were about three decades too late! <BR> <BR> <BR> If you think I'm not qualified to take a Chronicle review without having seen the whole movie, then go ahead. You try to sit with her, I bet you will not make it to the first appearance of the blue freaks before you apologize and leave. It's really ridiculous that someone has decided to cast it, and honestly, you'll be more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your DVD player with that laughing excuse of horror. In fact, do not be surprised if he packs his bags and sheets in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You were warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> Q. What kind of horror of 18 years does the woman keep a huge sports bra during the sex scene? See, the movie can not even understand ...
