As an army veteran, I was deeply offended by this movie. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap is a euphemism. If the film were presented as satire or even cartoon (era), it would have been better received. But I was taken seriously by my many people, especially abroad. As silly as it may seem, wherever I went in Europe in the late 1980s, people seemed to judge me and Americans in general for this film. Unrealistic Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic and muscular cretin is taken from a prison labor gang to go on a secret mission in Southeast Asia to free some American prisoners of war. In a battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammunition and never overheats. And he never loses, running with a 32lb weapon raised with one arm. I could go on, but I have a headache. I gave it a 2/10 just because it's slightly better than Rambo III.
