I hated the way Mrs. Perez played the Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghetto - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can not speak for the uneducated people you encountered. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better economically than any other Caribbean island! Am I glad we are not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Haiti, free from American influence? Free in true poverty, not in the US poverty pattern. We are not victims, we are resilient, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our ascendancy includes strong African roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing in common with the American Negroes who did the research. <br /> <br /> The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King is no longer out of the question. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, a true revolutionary - an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro create the Cuba he is today, which is why boats full of Cubans risk their lives to come to America - why did Che make such a better place for them? You had a great, brilliant idea, but you politicized too much. We have so many things to be proud of as people - do not embarrass our people by victimizing us. I'm not a Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can not share your views. I am a Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I have achieved many of my goals in America. If there is a part 2 in the future - less politics, more history, more stories of triumph - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
