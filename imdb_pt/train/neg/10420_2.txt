OK, I know a lot of people will probably resent this review, as Watership Down is a "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this movie for the first time at the tender age of 18, I must admit: I really hated that. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister had read the book and really liked it, and many people whined with their own words "Watership Down" - their memories of seeing the movie as children and having their emotions torn at the seams, it is recommended. To be honest, I wish I had not bothered. I gave the benefit of the doubt; usually I do not like to stop watching a movie in the middle of the road. This was an exception. It was really, really, terribly boring. This movie was possibly the slowest thing I've ever seen (imagine a snail in space), and it really did not "do" to me. The art was fine; the funds were well made, if not a little bland, and the rabbits themselves were not very nice and the animation was rather hectic and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I will not go into huge details about the plot; Basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits that leave their nursery due to the infiltration of humans in the area. Usually a moralistic story about the dangers of human interactions in the environment, he uses anthropomorphic rabbits to convey the message. To me, I kind of wished they were gassed, not because I was a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, annoying, and generally quite gross (oh, I'm so terribly English). I found that I was constantly looking at the clock while watching the movie, and it took about 20 minutes or so, until something really happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax. <br /> <br /> If I were to compliment it Anyway, I have to admit that the concept of showing children the dangers of building in the field and hopefully unraveling the arrogance of humans etc. is quite well- intentional Maybe she's all hypocrite and preacher in general, but the message she's trying to present is good in her nature. The score was not bad either. <br /> <br /> So to conclude, this movie is very bad. I could not watch it all the time, or I would probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom. Granted, it's not "bad" Torque, but it still does not rank highly in my eyes, so I gave it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
