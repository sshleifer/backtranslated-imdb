Kevin Spacey is very talented but unfortunately driving is not his forte. I had high expectations about the movie before renting it and maybe that's why I did not like it that much. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a movie that occurs mostly in a small scenario, but it's not the attempt that counts. I found the film bland, boring and stretched. The performance was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since he is aware in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (I had fun with how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this movie was the only photo of the top car accident. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera followed along the line and passed through the wreckage. However, this shot was very "Usual Suspects" ish and my guess is Spacey had the idea of ​​his previous movie (which is very good you mind). If you want to see a fabulous movie that happens in a small setting, watch Lifeboat at Hitchcock. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming it.
