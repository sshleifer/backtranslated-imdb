Despite having some exciting (and daring) sequences, NBTN simply never works. There are exploding boats, hat-like murders, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic horror / mystery scenes, but they are interspersed with long periods of sheer exposure. Everyone in the movie seems bored. This is a shame, because many of the sequences would be considered bold at the time this was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add to that the British characters "very correct" and you feel like you've entered a Sherlock. Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography is very common. There are many opportunities for beautiful pictures of the countryside, or complex photos of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire, but the whole thing is unimaginative and bland. <br /> <br /> Definitely only for fans of Lee and Cushing.
