Wow. I do not even remember much about this movie, unless it's awful. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically; A girl's parents neglect her, so this sick PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one disturbed by this? So this weird PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mother to pretend to be the girl. I do not care if he was trying to make the girl happy, this is disgusting. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. The girl was just a weeping brat who wanted things her way. She played with Unowns, was the "daughter" of Entei and apparently could grow up and decline in age on a whim with the help of her "father". <br /> <br /> That's pretty much all I can remember, but I think you can take that as a tip, and not see it. (Or if you come, do not expect too much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon; the First Movie".
