This tour of Naschy in 1974 is directed by Leon Klimovsky, and a superficial look at the photos and advertising packaging may lead you to believe that this medieval joke is somewhere between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> This is a strictly PG case with tame torture sequences, no nudity and little advantage at all. Naschy (of whom I am fan) exhibits his material like Gilles de Lancre, "old Marshal of the nation". Unfortunately he is more of a pantomime villain than anything else. One has the feeling, with this film, that we saw him (and he) did it all before. Strictly, therefore, only to Naschy complete.
