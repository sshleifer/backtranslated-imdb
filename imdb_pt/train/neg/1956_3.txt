This movie has a rescue feature. At one point, after a character is attacked by a fairy wielding an ax, her brother asks, "Why is your dick there, Chuck?" After suffering for almost an hour of bad movie, it almost made my drink come out of my nose. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances are not so bad, but the kids all stink and PJ Soles should be ashamed of herself for making this movie. The story is weak and no one does what you think (or what common sense says) that they should do. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many points of history that do not add up. For example, in one scene, the ghosts of small children need to focus on moving a physical object, so they can prove that they exist, a difficult feat, since they apparently can not interact with physical matter. However, minutes later, everyone grabbed branches off the ground and hit the Tooth Fairy with them. Apparently, they can sometimes move the matter and sometimes they can not. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Much blood and courage, though ... some beautiful breasts. But that does not make up for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy, go rent out "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, though many other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least it sets a mood.
