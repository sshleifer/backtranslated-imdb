Return is one of those films for the group of people who like movies that both bore and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or gets naked throughout the movie. I was willing to put up with this, however, I was not willing to put up with the worst edition ever combined with nonsensical flashbacks. In the end, she crashes the car when she is young. Or maybe I'm wrong and this was just a flashback. With this movie is impossible to say. Do you believe the same guy who made the Army of Darkness produce that crap? A much better idea is to stay home and watch the Army of Darkness channel on Sci Fi. That movie had it all: sluts, zombies and a guy with a chainsaw for an arm. The Forgetful does not even have one of those things.
