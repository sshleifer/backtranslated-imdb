I could not not recommend a Christmas movie more than this useless piece of drivel (trust me, double negatives are required here - its so bad). This film was in trouble since the opening credits, when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the composer. The musical numbers are very long and none of them are good ("Thank You Very Much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would gladly support the chains used by Scrooge in the bizarre sequence of the movie hell than to sit through this insult to the musicals of the movie again. <br /> <br /> The only fun part of this movie (completely unintentional) involves Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a silly white powder costume, Guinness ventures into his scenes in what was an attempt to make it look like he was floating like a ghost, or to show his utter contempt for having to be in this horrible movie. Albert Finney, in turn, combines the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his irremediably disgusting character of Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney's Scrooge is such a horrible person, it is impossible to believe in his transformation. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie abomination at all costs.
