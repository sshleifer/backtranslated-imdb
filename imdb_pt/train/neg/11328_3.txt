From time to time I'll rent an action / adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important. That's why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality movie, but it makes me laugh and allows me to relax for a while. One of these days I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I rented this movie because I wanted to have fun without being challenged. . Most of the time, I got what I wanted. The plot was something like a badly written Xena episode, and Kathy Long's acting was a very community theater (not bad for a professional kick boxer and an amateur actress). There were some high points from the cyborgs. Somehow they've gotten some very good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts movies, the more you get into the movie, the more emphasis there is on action, and the plot (which was not strong to start with) deteriorates almost as quickly as acting. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the longer the director devotes to his ass. At the end of the movie, I was seriously thinking about watching a second time just to count the number of times Kathy Long's tight red shorts were in the center of the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there simply was not enough meat for that. film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the movie for the second time. If you're a hard Xena fan who needs something to spend a few hours - by all means, go to the grocery store and spend the cents of 50 on rent. There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie. <br /> <br /> Just do not expect more than being slightly amused for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you happen to like Kathy Long's derri√®re. THEN you may want to buy a copy.
