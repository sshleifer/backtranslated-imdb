I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally, seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a small part, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I enjoyed the cinema in college and the only thing I can say I did not like was that the movie was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or common bathrooms. <br /> <br /> I have to say that acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chart the bad direction and the cast of support leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the movie visible. Otherwise, I would have written this as another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors who turned away at the end were very good. But the sound effects of the shooting were very bad. There are some flaws in the film (continuity), but they are negligible considering the low caliber of the film. <br /> <br /> On the whole, I liked the movie because Arnold Vosloo was in it. Jackie
