I was disgusted with this movie. No, it was not because of the graphic sex scenes, it was because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This movie does not have much truth about her and her art. He shows a work of art she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that she entered as a witness in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He left Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false accusations of rape to prevent her from suffering while she was tortured. According to transcripts of rape, he went on to claim that he never met Karen Artemisia (aka sex) while she repeatedly states "It's true." <br /> <br /> I encourage you all to leave. and find out about the real Artemisia and see what it really is. Do not base all your knowledge on this fictional movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really has an interesting story behind it and an incredible art work. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, but discover the true story of Artemisia.
