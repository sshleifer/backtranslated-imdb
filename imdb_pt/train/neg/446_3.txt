That was disappointing. Started well enough, but as he passed and missed every opportunity to climb, fell flat. Maria Schrader's acting is terrible, never seeming to mean what she says, or even knowing what she says until she says it. She did not show any genuine emotion, not for her beloved goy, nor for her mother's story. When with Lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother except that her mother seemed to be having fun at the wedding, which is not much. The supposed parallel between Hannah's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clich√© as they come, and failed miserably anyway. The wedding was completely unconvincing and a stupid finish. The climax of the protest was not inspiring, and no matter what Lena did or did not influence the outcome, she certainly would have shown some complexity of feelings at the time, a haunted look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the movie had depth or spark. It was very difficult to care about any of them, even with little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did she discard it when she was on the phone at the hotel? There was no context or explanation for that.) If every reference to him were removed, it would not be noticed. A simple story confused the development of the poor character (who was whose mother, again?) acting weakly, and directing this made everyone seem like they were acting. You could almost hear "quiet on the set! ...." I started to think that this was worth a 7 but as the movie continued dropped quickly to a 4 then gaining a 3 after the foolishness of the wedding scene. This was as cold and sterile a film as I have ever seen. A terrible waste of a good story.
