Surprisingly, the film has some redeeming quality as it approaches the end. On the other hand, this movie is being very bad and lame, with a small budget, insidiously bad script and all that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It's silly that all the money circulating Christian Circles, they can never get enough funds to make a decent movie. I am not religious, so I could not care less, but the film production makes some like a good tool to reach a new audience for the churches and make people more interested and curious in reading the Bible, for example . In this respect, these films always seem like a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> Low budget really hurts the movie and reduces it. This makes the film ridiculous of watching itself with its effects and just gives the film an exaggerated B movie feeling. <br /> <br /> But what's hurting the most about this movie is its writing. The things that happen in this movie are insulting to intelligence and I'm not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie moves forward is so unlikely and the people inside this movie do such improbable things that they are insulting to viewers. <br /> <br /> I also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times. . It seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a complete movie and they added some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up. I just could not care less sometimes. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that the film gets more solid and stable to the end, when its story gets more focused on its essence. It still remains predictable all but prevented this movie from being a complete disaster to watch and as much as these types of movies there is much more difficult to watch out there although I do not think this movie will conquer any new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
