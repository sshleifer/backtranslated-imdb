Not that I do not like children's movies, but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities. M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be incredibly funny, but the chance is not given in this movie. It is sugary sugar and would hardly appeal to someone over 7 years old. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 3/10
