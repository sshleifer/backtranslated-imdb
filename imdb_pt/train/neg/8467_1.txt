My friends and I rented this from Blockbuster because we saw the name of Nana Visitor in the box. This movie is a scam that I hope she denies from her CV. <br /> <br /> The "plot" was lost and flaccid, the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The movie made no sense. The rough plot of a kind of alien parasite that infects humans has often been made by films with much better scripts than that, for example, the invasion of body robbers and college. <br /> <br /> If you've ever had the misfortune of finding this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> As it ranks as a horror movie when there was no use of fear, suspense, blood, terror or any of the usual horror movies techniques that I do not know, however, if you still are wanting watching this movie, I suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand so you can find funny parts.
