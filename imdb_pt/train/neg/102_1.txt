My girlfriend once brought in the Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. We barely realized that the joke was because she had paid a pound for it. While watching this movie, I began to think of things I would rather do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These include: 1) Drinking bleach 2) Sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Reenacting the American Civil War 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote that? The guy could not even dig a hole properly. The best thing he did was kick a door down (the best part of the movie). This was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a movie had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> News just in: Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to kill himself. Fact. DO NOT SEE
