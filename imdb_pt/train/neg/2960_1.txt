This is undoubtedly the only worst movie ever created. There's no way to argue here. It is. History end. The story is juvenile and sub-moronic, looking like it was created by a three-year-old child fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is just stupid. It is inconceivable how one could invent something so stupid and find it amusing. The jokes are also quite weak. If you have not seen this movie, consider yourself lucky. If your morbid curious about how bad this movie is, please do not make me describe it. Words can not express how utterly awful this movie is. This is not bad like being a bad movie. Even those who have cohesion, if not entertainment value. This one. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply your level of evil by 5,000, and you have not yet come close to how horrible this movie is. After giving a point to Pokemon the Movie, giving this movie a point seems to be nothing short of charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film lessons? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. It looks like some paint lovers made this movie. If you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund. And do not even think about renting again.
