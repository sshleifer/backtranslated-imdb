I'm a big fan of Batman comic and I was disappointed when I could not find Batman: The Animated Series on TV anymore. I was excited to hear that there would be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I watched the first episode the day it debuted and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is very bad. It looks like a cheap and low quality Japanese anime. So again, almost all modern cartoons are like this. <br /> <br /> The characters' drawings are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk, Penguin is a Kung-Fu master, Mr. Freeze is an undead with an iceberg on his head, and Riddler is a similar Gothic Marilyn Manson (which is funny because I do not expect people obsessed with puzzles and puzzles to be Gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is that of the Joker. They turned him into a monkey / demented Bob Marley / Kung Fu fighter! The Joker is supposed to be Batman's deadliest foe, but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and meaningless. In one episode, your plan was to put your clown venom into dog food! Oh, that's bad! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the death of his parents, and that is why he fights crime. This version of Batman does not seem haunted by the deaths of his parents and is not at all interesting. He's not a detective either, just a fighter. If there is an enemy he can not defeat, he will not study the enemy to uncover his weaknesses as a detective would, he will only build a gigantic fighting robot to defeat them. Many times this show does not even look like a Batman show, just another brainless anime that is nothing more than nonsensical fights. <br /> <br /> What I hate most about this show is what they did to the villains. They took away everything that makes them friendly and relatable and turned them into stereotypical villains. The bat-man is the greatest example. In comic books, he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. By experimenting on himself, he accidentally turns into a giant bat creature. In this program, he is a mad scientist who wants to turn himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason. Just about all villains are like that; none of them, with the exception of one or two, has a real motive for their crimes. <br /> <br /> The worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comic books, Freeze was a mad scientist until genius writer Paul Dini wrote the episode of BTAS "Heart of Ice," which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic, three-dimensional and nice villain. The episode was so popular that the fans accepted it like its true origin and was even used in the comic like its origin. Even that shitty movie Batman & Robin used as their origin. In this show, he is a jewel thief before becoming Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He's still a jewel thief! Great origin. No wonder they used what Dini created. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Batman, I do not dislike this show just because it's not like the comics, because I also liked BTAS, the Batman drawings that came later, Tim Burton's Batman movies and , obviously the excellent films of Christopher Nolan Batman. None of them were 100% true to comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not that it's not exactly like the comics or BTAS, it's that it does not have any kind of depth that makes the other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I gave this program so many chances, but the more I watch, the more I think it disappoints me. I miss the good old days when Batman's drawings were something everyone could appreciate.
