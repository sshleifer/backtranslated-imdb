the only good thing about the movie is the title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the movie. When I went to the theater, I was not expecting Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a movie that is pure popcorn, but instead I got that horrible Roy Liotta movie called "Turbulence". Yes, that's how bad the SOAP is. The only thing that makes soap better is its title. And it's not even the title of the movie, there was not even a glimpse of "snake" or "airplane" in the 40 minutes of the movie! What misleading advertisement! If it were not for its title, SOAP would just be another unforgettable B-grade summer movie cheap. And the R classification? It has to be the worst rated movie of all time! The creators of the film add only a few words to make it an R, and all violence is maintained at the pg-13 level. Do you know what is really rated? Rated R Superstar! See you in Summerslam instead of wasting your money with a snake!
