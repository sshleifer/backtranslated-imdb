This movie tried to be many things at once: poignant political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, romantic sentimental comedy, promotion of family values ​​... the list goes on and on. He failed miserably in all of them, but there was enough interest to stop me from turning it off to the end. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a thing. clumsy effort, especially when he will be led by his targets to reflect the lack of serious criticism, rather than simply the bad writing, direction and production of this particular film. <br /> <br /> a criticism of the corporatization of war. But mocking in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. Remind me a little of THREE KINGS, which similarly trivialize a genuine cause of concern.
