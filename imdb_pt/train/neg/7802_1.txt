A chemical spill is turning people into zombies. It is up to two doctors to survive the epidemic. It's an Andreas Schnaas movie, so you know what the pair will be for the course. Bad acting, horribly horrible special effects, and no budget to speak of. The dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write a word about that piece of excrement, let alone the ten mandatory lines because of the guidelines put in me by IMDb. My original review of just one word: Crap would not fly, so I have to revise it and go over to how bad it is. But I do not know if I can, so ... wait, I think I may have enough words or lines to make this review go away. Which is cool, I guess. So in a nutshell: This movie sucks balls, I do not watch. <br /> <br /> My notes: F
