This film is simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment not only of the British film industry but also of the untried hackers in action today. Not only did the film achieve mainstream distribution, but also features a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? I do not know and I just do not care enough to get involved with the debate because the film was so terrible that it deserves no thought. Be warned and stay away from this garbage. but apparently I need to write ten lines of text in this review, so I can detail the plot. A man's nob is created by his friend and evil colleague in the company of his father and thus leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dishonest accents and stupid and very stupid twists. I should have asked for my money back, but maybe I was still in shock with the experience. if you want a good crime movie, watch the usual suspects or the godfather, how about the block, the stock ... that's the pinnacle of the contemporary British crime film ...
