A real head scratch from a Bill Rebane movie that seemed to be worsening in its trade throughout the eighties. Three crazy millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a final permanent competition in which the final competitor will receive $ 1 million as long as he gets so far. A series of distasteful jokes are drawn into some of the guests, while others get involved with what most adults would do under the circumstances, meaning they were popped into the hotel bar. Most scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on various parts of the female body, including a number of opening dance that is a cross of American Bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with prostitutes. If there was any hesitation that white people can not dance this scene hammers the last nail in that coffin. Pay close attention to the nipple slip. This continues for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts at multiple twists, and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene, leaving that mess incoherent. It's a game until it's not a game. The three old coots are in full control until they are not. The hotel is owned by a supernatural force until it only becomes props. They're dead until they're gone. Even the narrator at the end responds that he does not know what the hell happened. I challenge anyone to reason where Rebane was going on that. The acting is dinner theater caliber minus dinner. Most of the actors probably returned to their day jobs at the local Stuckey. I give a few stitches to the scene in which the wide yuppie opens the closet and a skeleton is inside the skull rubbing. Let's see Gone With the Wind do it! This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the ruin of me. Bane, buy it! How to Slay! I hate myself.
