Four years after making his directorial debut with the thriller "Welcome To L.A.," Alan Rudolph shows us that what he really wanted from Hollywood was to be one of the guys. "Roadie" is a complete fraternity mess with bar fights, horny harpies, Art Carney in a soggy wheelchair ... and Meat Loaf at the wheel. Meat Loaf (playing Travis W. Redfish!) It's actually a very charming onscreen presence, and maybe in a smaller role (in a better movie) he's really insinuating, but Zalman King's script is full of stupid country idiot humor and helpless Meat Loaf is kept wide-eyed and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie make appearances - and they all seem embarrassed. They certainly should, "Roadie" is a bad trip. NO STARS of ****
