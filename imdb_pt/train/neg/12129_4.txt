Before this film, I had seen only two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the trashy zombie film Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous among horror fans for its unforgettable performance of Peter Bark and the giallo Stripis For his killer. Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of film, but both were especially entertaining (and their nudity and nudity did not hurt them). The massacre, however, is monotonous, boring, monotonous, despite a bit of splashing and a strange spot of naked, free meat. <br /> <br /> The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror movie are residing during their filming, is confusing and oh-so annoying: when blood is not flowing and the skin is not exposed, the film is a real struggle to sit down (it took me four tries to finish), with endless scenes of nasty characters fighting each other and making very little of note. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest about the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of his death scenes to study his mega-gory film Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've seen this movie then there is very little reason to worry about the massacre.
