This is one of those movies that makes you want the time you watched back and then some, such as the time you accidentally chose, the time you spent going to the store, etc. <br /> <br /> First, the appearance: it is grainy, it is low budget. Now this in itself does not make a bad movie. But the way it was filmed makes the action seem unnatural, so it's kind of distracting. <br /> <br /> So, the story. 3 gallons go on a gallon weekend away from the guys. Of course, as everyone does when going in a camp, they stop on the way to get earrings. When they arrive in the area where they will be staying, they are stopped by Mr. Ranger, who rebukes them for throwing a lit cigarette in the car at the fire station, and then takes them to where they are going. (a remote booth). Of course, 2 "cute guys" wander around the neighborhood, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately injured, but apparently Bambi is in love with anything with two legs. Mady is a bit disappointed with this event because she was looking forward to a weekend forgetting her ex, looking stupid and stoned with her friends. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot, there is an old hermit living that way, who is perhaps someone he does not come across, and the area and cabin in which they are staying have a kind of " reputation". <br /> <br /> So, of course, sooner or later (sadly, MUCH later) some of our wooden weekend visitors begin to die, and find several pitfalls (although some of them actually knock a little below that) and of course, the remaining campers are understandably upset. No cell phone reception is clear (who would miss the chance to check the cell phone to receive the receipt in a movie more?). Mr. Ranger Sir continues to appear at odd moments and his behavior seems a bit strange, but he said he will get help. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic touch to this that you simply will not want to miss too if you are still awake. Pray for you to wake up to a blank screen. <br /> <br /> The acting on it is terrible, the production values ​​are terrible, and the whole venture is just lame and I think it's incredible that it's been launched. Avoid at all costs, 1 out of 10.
