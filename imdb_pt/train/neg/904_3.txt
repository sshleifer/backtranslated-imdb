"Stella," starring Bette Midler in the title role, is a brazen tear. Located in upstate New York, Stella Claire works as a waitress, serving and dancing in a worker's lounge. One night, a medical intern, Stephen Dallas, arrives, who attracts Stella, and in the course of his novel he makes her pregnant. She rejects both her marriage offerings and abortion, sends him to a lucrative medical career, and creates her own daughter almost in poverty. Flash-forward 16 years and the daughter has become a beautiful and loving young woman. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, still maintaining a tenuous but loving relationship with his daughter and ... I'm rambling, and even worse, making the movie sound a little interesting. The acting and script are so exaggerated that you let out a moan in almost every scene. The offending boss is Bette Midler, but right behind is John Goodman as his alcoholic friend. Each scene seems more planned than the previous one until the end, which is really a hoot. Regarded as a dramatic play, this film has no more than grade D, but as a camp, it gains an unintentional B +. <br /> <br />
