Any movie that starts with a cowhand fucking a female calf can not promise much. As for the kibbutz stereotype as it was 50 years ago, I was there and it was not like that. Okay, every kibbutz had just a little piece of something shown in the movie (like young people invading the kitchen at night), but you can not show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those - let's say - naughty features. Each kibbutz had its own problems, but almost no kibbutz possessed all of them. The visions of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in that garden of Eden called Emek. Yes, and the acting was also good, so you see it was not all black - just a wrong portrait - probably on purpose too.
