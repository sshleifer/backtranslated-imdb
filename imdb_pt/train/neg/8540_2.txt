As someone mentioned, it starts with a bizarre prologue about a blonde little girl killing a cat. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and make a trip to the mountains. First they spend the night in a guesthouse where the slightly deaf landlord is irritated, with growing irritation to the public, by Gaffari. Once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited by a gentle old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?) What will happen next I will leave for the bold viewer to settle because I certainly could not. Now, I like Eurohorror, and it would be better if Artigot (writer and director) had made some attempt to tell logical stories. The backdrop (Pyrenees?) It is an excellent and intriguing site for mysterious and hidden occurrences. The green peaks could easily obscure the supernatural forces and those who command them. Photography is cool. I just wanted the whole thing to make sense. You can see this movie on archive.org.
