The script was VERY weak without enough arcs to make you care a little about the characters or what happens to them. The script is too coarse and not enough to act like a slow pace. The story gets to the point where you want everyone to just shut up and die as fast as possible, so you do not have to listen to them speak that dumb and rigid dialogue. On a technical note, the music mix is ​​very loud and makes it difficult to understand what is being said most of the time. Then again, this could be called a blessing. Overall, the same story could best be told in a 30-minute short film. The obvious "in your face" homage to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been good, if they had been more subtle, but here they look more like a bald guy ripped off. Come on, that kind of 35mm budget and that's the best that could be done? Still, the cinematography, the lighting design and the shots were very well done.
