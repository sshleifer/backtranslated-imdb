I read the review of Chris_m_grant from the United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "A fantastic documentary from 1924. This geography of the early 20th century of present-day Iraq was powerful." <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in Iran's nomads Bakhtiari, in the mountains and landscapes of Zagros and watched the film Grass, A Nation's battle for life. These traditions you've seen in the movie have lasted for centuries and will continue as long as life lasts. I am from this region of Iran myself. I am a Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran, not Iraq, as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. Taking an Iranian by an Iranian is almost like picking up an American for a Mexican. Thank you, <br /> <br /> Ziba
