This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The fact that they have a fragile plot is bad enough, that they hooked him around the issue of violence in football makes it 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premise of this film before I even started to watch, but I kept it open enough to accept the way the writers found it appropriate to introduce the character of Elijah Wood, Matt , on the hooligan scene. <br /> <br /> But the film shows imprecision after inaccuracy, to the point that in the middle of the film each one makes you shrink more than the previous time. <br /> <br /> Let's clear up a few things: Hooligans do not tend to crush virtually their own pub before a race. mill league game; they do not intend to kill one another; they do not use ONLY Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not). They certainly do not, when taking exception of a new member of the company, go out into the territory of their rival companies for pie and puree. And I would love to meet the hool who would and grass in the top boy of his company for the rival company. (Although you can scratch what I said about getting ready to kill each other if there is one). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm still to see a movie about it that does not. It does not contain some whims of fantasy, but this is on an equal footing with The Company for lack of notion. <br /> I ironically think that Wood's American enemy is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user when that is part of it. and plot of the British vandals scene. The film chooses not to defy Wood's morale and instead prevents any company from using Coca-Cola. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think I made my point. As for plot, it is highly unimaginative, and I am sure that if I had not gone through the whole movie lamenting the points, and more, done above, I would have guessed what was happening earlier than I. And believe me, I was way ahead. <br /> <br /> I have the distinct impression that this film is intended for men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised. <br /> <br /> If I am right, the manufacturers have completely failed. It's too unrealistic to be appreciated by anyone who knows the scene, and I can not believe that the kind of woman looking for emotional movies would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies. <br /> <br /> Are there good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by slow-motion action, certainly not when it's a fight, since the point is that a ruck is getting enough of it anyway. <br /> <br /> There are some funny, if unreal moments. Wood's trip to school made me smile. But some slightly funny moments hardly make up for the observation of two hours of complete manufactured slag. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid like the plague, if it is not to develop more misconceptions of the scene if you are not know. If you are American, you can enjoy it because it is clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is fragile, predictable and, ultimately, exaggerated.
