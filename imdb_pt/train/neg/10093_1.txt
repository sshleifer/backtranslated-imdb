I can not believe blockbuster carries this movie. It was so bad. I was totally fooled by the art of the box. DO NOT BE FOOLED !! Not worth your time I promise you. I do not know if the positive comments for this movie were a joke or what. I'm so disappointed. :( The description on the back of the box does not even match The girl who has the voodoo done on her is a stripper The synopsis on the back says that she is only 17 years old. <br /> <br /> And if you really liked this movie, then I lost all faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> And neither even make me start the story in comparison to the title, or the fact that the whole film was made in 2 locations, or that the cops do not even have real uniforms. of the film, the uniforms were in place. This film is an insult to the zombie genre and all its fans.
