This movie is really worse than most movies I've ever had, and I've suffered a lot. Absolute absurdity. He has a terrible and forced dialogue; meaningless plot developments; actually drew scenes from 'ghostly images' that look more like a high school corrective art project than a horror movie; 5/10 at best, attractive women; long, boring sex scenes involving so-called women (forget what you know about virgins, especially those with false breasts); muttered, hard to understand speech of some of the characters; and they actually wore the Outer Space Killer Klowns masks during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving grace because the movie was pretty funny, but it's not. Veden Fell is the bad guy in movie history. <br /> <br /> Absolutely give this one a miss.
