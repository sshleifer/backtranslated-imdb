I just rented and watched this movie just to see what's out there. So here is what my reactions to it are. It is easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors. The main plot of this film is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists. This concept, if done right, can easily become a really provocative film. However, the film does not shock or upset me. It only bored me. This film can be easily reduced to less than 45 minutes. All the scenes are mostly there to fill the time, like those scene scenes and some scenes that I described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ***** ******* I find the rape scenes quite tame. I do not know if I noticed the cut or uncut version, if there is such a version. I also found many holes in the already poorly written plot. Here is a list at the top of my mind. <br /> <br /> Why do not rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she leaves home to find out what the fuss is? This would be an excellent time. <br /> <br /> Why do not they just rape the gang, instead of delaying the pleasure of some of the rapists and prolonging Jennifer's suffering for so long. It would probably be more shocking and disturbing in this way. <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid that the rapists left her in the woods and went back to her house. Maybe to show that these rapists are really jerks. <br /> <br /> These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job, they should not send an imbecile coward to do the job. /> <br /> Why did not Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? What should be the first thing that pops into the minds of most people, especially to someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why did these rapists not smell danger from miles away when they saw Jennifer alive? <br /> <br /> I think it's really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up. tree and hang it. ************************ The spoiler ends ************ <br /> <br /> But, hey , this movie is not without its merits, Camille Keaton is beautiful and I can hear one of the funniest phrases I heard recently when Matthew protests coming home and kills Jennifer, `Why me? Why me, I did not even c !!!
