This is pretty much a low budget, made for TV, kind of movie that you want to take advantage of the success of the original. I'm a fan of b-movies, and this might have been nice if they had not attached the name "Cube" to it, because, as it is, the director and plot of the original were better, and that movie pretty much ruined my work. I like the whole series. The characters are annoying and clich√©s, there are problems with continuity and several production failures. History hardly has the chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffers from it. They used more or less the same tricks of terror throughout the movie, and because the first one was so good, it simply becomes a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If this were a b-standalone movie, I'd probably give it about four. The "1" rating I gave was pretty much a statement about how it was paled in effects and intelligence when compared to the first.
