William Hurt diving scientist ??? North American agents running overseas research? The sick infected man kicking his butt after dropping 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper missing and not killing Hurt (only wounding him), but the second "kill" shot is dead? Waste of time. To compare this to falling like other reviewers did is ridiculous. Oh, and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the "evil" agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the "virus handshake". What? BTW ... when IMDb required 10 lines of text? I'm just babbling here. Does not this only eliminate content from reviews if you are required to have x number of rows?
