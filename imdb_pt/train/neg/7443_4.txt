There were some scary scenes, which I always liked more than dry blood, but otherwise this movie was pretty weak. There were many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain something in the film, it was still unclear. After watching this movie, I still seemed lost in many ways. It reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. This movie was also unsatisfying, but even better than that, because he tried to work and the story really made sense. This, not so much. <br /> <br /> The acting in large part of the Abandoned was decent, but the film dragged on and never gave any kind of satisfactory conclusion. As I said above, there were some scary scenes, but on the other hand, this movie was a mess. Sorry, I can not recommend.
