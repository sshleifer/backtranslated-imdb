Who did the research for this movie? It is set in Baghdad in 2004, however, all soldiers are using ACUs and have all Universal Camouflage Pattern equipment. Nobody was using these things in 04. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie while I was sent abroad and can I say that the overwhelming feeling of the public was WTF? This movie made no sense, there were characters coming and going with no explanation, and people doing ridiculous things that would NEVER happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but obviously it's trying to portray something realistic. He fails miserably, but is trying. <br /> <br /> It's as if someone had a lot of random ideas, chewing and swallowing, then vomiting a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I sat the whole thing. GI Joe was one of those that really made you think in comparison to that. TO STAY AWAY!
