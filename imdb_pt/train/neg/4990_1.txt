I can enjoy a guilty pleasure watcher movie, but that's just bad. And it's not bad in a way that you enjoy seeing the MST3K having fun. It's simply nauseatingly bad as you can not find anything to enjoy about it, no matter how hard you try. I really regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this crap. You can tell by noting that no one was asked to act and everyone knew that this movie would only bury their careers. Apparently, "Walking Tall" accrued enough income that someone decided they could make a buck of their investment. If it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's so bad it wiped out the worst movies in my memory.
