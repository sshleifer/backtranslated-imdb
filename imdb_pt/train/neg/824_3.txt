Gene Hackman is expelled from prison by an unnamed government agency that wants him for a murder. Of course Hackman has the proficient skills for the job. <br /> <br /> No one tells you anything, it is given as the public is given pieces and information. This is suspense, instead it's annoying and annoying. <br /> <br /> Hackman continues with the mission, but the escape is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders all dead to cover it up. So everyone in the cast dies and in the end you really do not care. <br /> <br /> One of the other critics pointed out that the film was originally double the time, almost three hours and was cut pretty little. Maybe something was really lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was an act of mercy in the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented cast that had people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney and Eli Wallach. and Edward Albert is so completely wasted here that it's a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never found out exactly what the federal agency was doing, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even the IRS.
