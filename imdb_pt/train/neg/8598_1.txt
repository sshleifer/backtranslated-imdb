Just kidding! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was so bad, though, that it was hilarious. My friend and I purposely rented it because it looked so bad. Cheesy old horror movies are always good for some laughs. The stinky plot, some of the voices were dubbed, the quality was horrendous. But I certainly enjoyed watching!
