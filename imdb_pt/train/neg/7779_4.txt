"True" story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins to pollute the waters. Fun movie of monsters, though not very good, there are lots of people trying to catch the monster and find out what is happening, but not in a completely engaging way. Give him points by giving us a giant monster that they've clearly built to scale to some scenes, but they take some because it looks like a non-threatening puppy. A fun exploration movie that is pleasantly silly in the right mood. (My only complaint is that the print used at Elvira's launch is so bad it looks like a videotape copy that has already passed 20 years ago.)
