This movie was terrible. OK, my favorite movie is 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I've always been inclined to be a bit biased. <br /> <br /> The plot continues, throwing away enough of the key elements of the original to make the term 'remake' highly dubious. (He's not a virgin, but he's allergic to bees.) So many things happen that do not make sense and are inexplicable, which I'm afraid Mr. LaBute will not make a horror movie. (Like two people we've clearly seen were blown up in a car at the beginning, well alive at the end of the movie?) Cage looks downcast and baffled everywhere, and his character is likely to call "Rowan !?" the least noise. The 'nods' to the original are annoying as they become cheesy, not as a clever homage. For example, certain incidents mirror the original (The girl falling from a closet pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage is scouring the island) and several lines of dialogue are taken directly from Anthony Schaffers' original script and put on his pants. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis of that, I really will not mind writing more about this movie. It does not have any kind of substance. Throw it in the trash with all the other remakes that tarnished the good names of the movies they were "based on" (in this case very loosely).
