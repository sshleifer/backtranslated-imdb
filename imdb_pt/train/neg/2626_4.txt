I saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of the Fast Forward film festivals, where we started renting a bunch of B movies and voting for those who chose the worst. <br /> <br /> On the night we witnessed this, we were voted the best, due to the similarity of plot and fun outfits. <br /> <br /> This is certainly a silly, kitschy movie to be seen under the full understanding that you are watching a low budget buzz. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... this movie will make your mark on you. <br /> <br /> It left a lot of impression on me that I've been trying hands on a copy for a few years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you are planning to watch bad movies. This is fun, and I remember bouncing music ...
