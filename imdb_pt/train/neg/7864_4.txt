The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar-nominated movie, it's just pure entertainment, in which you can get lost for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees struggling against the notorious mutilated countrymen on their last day of desert training. It's just them fighting through the whole movie, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie), since blood and guts are constantly flying through the whole thing, as well as another graphic rape scene that is uselessly thrown to shock the public. <br /> <br /> I would give Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure fun, and that's all. Although, nonetheless, I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film continued as it began to creep due to the fact of continuing to try to shock the audience with graphics and occasional jumping scenes just to ensure that the audience stay awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something to pass the time if you are bored, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
