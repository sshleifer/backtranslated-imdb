Alan Rudolph is a director without that special touch. As an example, there was a shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office that could have expressed the entire relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph wasted this. The camera is in the hallway peering through the doors of the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave alone in their respective rooms. You have the idea of ​​your desolation and isolation, but not much else. The lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could have been greatly improved. If I were driving, I would have spent all day, if necessary, to get the shot right. This is the beauty and power of the film: it can express many whole lives in a matter of seconds. The shot with the child stepping in the vomit pool could have been improved. The child should have shown more fascination with the puddle, should have stepped and dragged his feet, should have bowed his head to look at the puddle with all his attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. It's true, but instead of conveying his inner turmoil to voice, gesture, body movement, the film draws on narration and dialogue with his imaginary alter ego, played by Denis Leary.
