This movie is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, acting is ... Well, Dani, keep singing or screaming or whatever the hell you usually do. Random girls wearing almost nothing are just to catch sexually frustrated gothic boys. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. The story and the characters CAN be very good, if they say that the direction, the actors and other small things were made better. But the movie is bad, the only reason people like this crap is because it has Danni in it. This movie is possibly the worst B-rate movie ever. And, believe me, it's hard to come by, especially when you're competing with Def by Temptation and with bad excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a fan of CoF, and so I see it as another trash film ... A really bad one. If Dani did this as a comedy, then it's good to go with him. Well done. More than that, I rate it as low because it's crap. Watch when you are happy, happy, joyful, joyful, so you can laugh at everything or if you have many different types of drugs.
