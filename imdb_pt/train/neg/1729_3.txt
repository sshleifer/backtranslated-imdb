... and how they got you out of your mind! Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic 1970s BAD movies made without actors of any note, an embarrassing script, unfortunate direction and a relentless desire to merge "horror" with light comedy. This film features a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur under Crater Lake ... a meteor falls from the sky, and a claymation aquatic dinosaur begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants that surround Lake Crater. The whole issue is settled by Steve, our local sheriff. Much of the movie - when it does not show the blood puddles left behind by what we imagined must be the beast dinner - is spent following the disorderly mischief of two guys named Arnie and Mitch, who run a boat rental spot. They try so hard to be funny, that we have lines like, looking at a business sign, Mitch telling Arnie "You spelled wrong bait, it's written B-A-T-E." The laughter was very scarce here. We then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy beware! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way. And at least the lake is beautiful.
