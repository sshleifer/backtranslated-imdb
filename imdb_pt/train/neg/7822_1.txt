This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classic theme. I used to love Superman movies, but this one made me want to kill myself. Very bad acting, outrageous special effects and a plot equal to zero. To summarize: Superman leaves Earth because scientists have discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh), do not say anything to his girlfriend before leaving (duh again), take off in a spaceship (?!?), Come back I think 5 years later, and we look forward to connecting with his girlfriend again (who is now ravaging his son, what son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). What about Lex Luthor? Trying to grow a new continent to sell land? Please !! <br /> <br /> I vote 1 in 10 for this movie, just because I am not allowed to vote 0. If you have anything else to do with your time, do not go see this movie, and even you have nothing else to do, stay home and watch TV!
