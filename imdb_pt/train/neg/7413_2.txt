I just watched, I can not say I was impressed. <br /> <br /> It starts off really well, the look and feel of the atmosphere gives a scary feeling like this kind of movie should. But it all ends when lordi's first monster appears. Not only do you recognize them from the Lordi band, but they are seriously misplaced in the movie. Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80s. As for the plot, it starts out as like horror movies, people trapped inside a hole in hell. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. The viewer is thrown a few lines at possible reasons, but the lines never meet and end up in nothing but a mess. With all the money spent on this movie, with an intriguing start and some good effects, I thought someone would take better care of the product. I wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that his costumes can be scary (except they are not). <br /> <br /> So the film gains credibility for the visual, I think the money had to go somewhere. But the rest is an embarrassing attempt by a rock band to make their monster nicknames on the stage more scary.
