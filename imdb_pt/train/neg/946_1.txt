Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me because people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /> <br /> For being so popular, I tried more than once to watch it and I can not go through an entire episode. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the acting is horrible. Everyone is exaggerating to the point of being annoying to watch. They speak in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones, and have unnatural body language. I've seen better acting in a playground part of kindergarten. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, IT'S NOT FUNNY. The plots are dull. They are not creative, intelligent or fun. Should not it be a funny comedy? Why am I not laughing? <br /> <br /> Finally, what are the seventy about it? It's as authentic for the seventies as "Happy Days" was for the 50's. <br /> <br /> Oh and what about Ashton Kutcher? Who launched this un-talented stunt? And now he's making movies? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think this is a quality television, it worries me.
