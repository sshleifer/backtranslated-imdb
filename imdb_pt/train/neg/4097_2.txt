The bad news is that it's still really terrible. I gave it a 2 because occasionally some of these parodies of antics seem really funny. <br /> <br /> It's better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker," and progress must be rewarded. Or maybe I was drinking a lot when I watched and I felt generous. Anyway, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it turned out really fast. He picks up elements of most of Kill Bill I and II's key themes and fights with scenes, tricks them, dulls them all, sucks up the dialogue, and smashes the whole mess in an hour of really awful amateur video. <br /> <br /> You'd better smoke a lot if you want to enjoy this. And take this DVD back to the video store on time! You really will hate yourself if you have to pay a late penalty.
