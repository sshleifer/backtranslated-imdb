Have you noticed how in your later films Burt Reynolds's laughter sounds like abrupt brakes? <br /> <br /> It must have been too much trouble with Hal Needham. <br /> <br /> And the look of "Stroker" Ace, too much. <br /> <br /> Do you believe this was based on a book? <br /> <br /> Neither could I, but it was. a bestseller, I bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another good old boy on the NASCAR circuit who joins Beatty as a fried chicken mogul with drawings on his team. <br /> <br /> Anderson provides the love interest that exists and Nabors makes his umpteenth impression of Gomer Pyle as a loyal mechanic / best friend Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends with Burt's or Hal's others must have needed the work. in action, and seem to have more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As far as laughter is concerned, Bubba Smith (pre-"Police Academy") receives them as Beatty's driver. , in Elvira's complete mode, gets a lot of praise as a lady who wants to get to know Lugs very well. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Burt has j I took so much time and effort into a movie like "Stroker Ace," where it did not matter if he bothered to act or not. They did not bother writing a character for him, so why bother to act? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Especially for Petersen and the out-takes at the end. Now they're funny.
