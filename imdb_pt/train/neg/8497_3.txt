My title should be enough. I am confused that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would produce tosh as the cinematic movement "nouvelle vague". Until the twentieth century, France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and intelligent philosophy. But the minute you give them a camera, they start acting like WOOOHOOO LOOK WIRD I CAN BED! PLOT? THEME? PSHAW! LET'S FILM A RIDE OF FUN PARKS BACK AND ON! At least, this is not as bad as Godard (who has a sickly fascination in the back of people. Oh-la-la, quel artiste.). No, Truffaut maintains a certain degree of visual clarity. But so does the security camera in a quickie-mart. The two are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, just as an aside for all who prefer the film school nerds: I bet the vein is coming off the side of your neck now. But do not leave without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you hate it. People who like this movie have probably never read any book other than the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or perhaps "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxies." Or maybe they've read the lyrics of The Doors songs, and they think that this is changing profoundly. Whatever floats your boat. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the most refined and significant writers that ever existed. Nice try, truffles. But you're not even close to the stadium. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film as an AIDS-infected syringe. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person you like to think about, then stay with Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, enjoy Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And for God's sake, push the vein back into your neck. You look like cabbage.
