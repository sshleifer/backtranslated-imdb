I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. Granted, it is Shakespeare and it takes a certain mentality to be interested or not. But this film surpasses any barrier of long soliloquies and what can not stop many from simply not caring about a Shakespeare-based story. The biggest obstacle to this production is the total flatness of the characters. Often, during the interaction of the character, it is almost difficult to distinguish who it is who it is. I believe this movie is dubbed in English. Certainly they could have gotten voice actors who could have added a bit more drama to these classic and literary lines. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to evaluate this movie with more than one, although it may be based on prejudices. of perhaps age and what would seem like a very low budget. Still, it is absolutely painful and annoying. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
