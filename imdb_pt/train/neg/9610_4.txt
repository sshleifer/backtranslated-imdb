In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think all studios can do a western, except the Warner brothers. The few times they try it is always ridiculous (except, perhaps, for having died with their boots - which is a Western cavalry). I read that Humphrey Bogart, seeing James Cagney in this big cowboy hat on his head, said he looks like a mushroom. Truth! Cagney and Bogart are very urban, also from the twentieth century to be credible in a Western movie. The story here was not surprising, and it did not help. Every ten minutes, I think I see Bogart and Cagney dropping their weapons and putting their hands on a machine gun to flee the scene in a black car of the 1930s.
