One of the wedding lick movies you will see. Enough of your time period so it was outdated before you hit the theaters. Ethnic stereotypes are like a joke to Henny Youngman, except they're not at all funny here. Molly Ringwald, well, what else needs to be said. To give her a clue to foolishness, she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress, because "I will not just be me" goes into this cloth with loops and puts on a top hat, and everyone smiles at her in instead of touching his neck. It's a hell too, see how Ally Sheedy is heavy. Wheeeew!
