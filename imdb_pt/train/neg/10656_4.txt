What can I say. A Kamal Hassan movie being horrible. He acts very well, but it is a horrible story, along with a horrible direction. In my opinion, director Gautham Menon should give up directing. There is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie. Moreover, one can not believe the veracity of horrendous crimes. There was no practicality in the film. Gautham is running out of stories. But Kamal Hassan and Jyothika act very well. The villains seem very ugly, although their performance is not bad. I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa that you can see with family. You will not be able to sleep watching this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj again did a great job, and that's why I gave this film 4 out of 10. His song 'Partha Modail Nallae' is soulful and soothing. Also, great cinematography. Overall, this is just a bad and bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think, should have rejected this film.
