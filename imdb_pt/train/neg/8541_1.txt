Welcome to the 17 movie in the refrigeration classics 50 pack. Where we'll see, that's right. Another movie that makes absolutely no sense. Seriously, this movie made me so confused in the end that I thought I was watching again "At Dawn they Sleep." The plot seems simple enough .... well, that's up to 3 seconds in the movie, where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then ... um ... explode? I have no idea what happened. and that was BEFORE THE TITLE SCREEN. This is really sad when I can not even say what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's starring a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping her other girlfriend on the way to take pictures. of something somewhere. so we got there but not before someone steals your jeep to take you 200 feet out of the way towards a city. suspect? Nah so they decide to stay in this deserted village with an old lady. and then blah blah things happen and blah blah talking. The guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason, even if the old lady tells him not to do it. He gets lost and then finds his way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention that this is after 20 incredibly insane minutes of them staying at the house of a guy who looks like that buggy-eyed guy from Casablanca. Then they leave. There is really no point for this scene. It's really just filling. if you cut, no one would have noticed or cared. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, that was really the best part of the movie. wait. let me rephrase that. REALLY, unfortunately, that was the best part of the movie. because the rest is so confusing that I had to search the IMDb to find out what happened. But of course no one else knows, so I'm SOL. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most memorable moments I've ever seen in the movies. They dressed her in a dress, he was kidnapped, then released, runs back home, then in the end the witches are in the house and finish? seriously. I almost never got so confused in a movie. I mean, as bad as movies like "War of Robots" are, at least, they make sense. this movie does not even make ATTEMPT consistent. the ending was as confusing as the end of "At dawn they sleep" and the plot was much more boring. This movie gets a 1 just for its sheer "I have no idea what happened in this movie". "Witches Mountain" gets a confused movie observer of 10.
