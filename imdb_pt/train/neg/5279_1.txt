My friends can usually endure many hopeless movies, but this one was too bad for us to watch until the end. It was so boring and unoriginal. Not even the "hot" girls who starred in this movie could keep me watching. Everything was just predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The acting was sometimes good ... but more bad times. The most annoying character in the entire movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the best friend of the main characters. The more I saw it, the more I wanted to break my screen. (You know what an ugly, fat kid I'm talking about) <br /> <br /> The plot has been made so many times before I think they should be sued by other movie companies. OK, that's a good idea, but that's all the movie did. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie can only be seen by yourself, to save any abuse from your friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
