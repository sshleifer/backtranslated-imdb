I have to be completely honest in saying first that I slept somewhere in the middle so I can not give a full opinion on the movie until I see it in full. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), plan to make a fortune by stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from Finisham's maternity hospital. This is where the title character Matron (Hattie Jacques) works along with staff members Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball ). Patients and their visitors are also nearby, including pregnant Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nervous husband, Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Maynard as Freddy and Wendy Richard of EastEnders as Miss Willing. This plan, by the way, is not working, because all employees are messing around. This can all say about the movie until I see it again in full. OK!
