Everything about this movie is pig washing. Acting pitiful, terrible dialogue, ugly native girls. this movie sinks into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a weekend bender. Robert C. is totally lost and has no idea what's going on. The college kids are the worst. No acting talent, very stupid reasoning and just right dumbbells. Special effects are for birds. The so-called security force around this park belongs to the land of toys: with stupid weapons, useless walkie talkies; and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother inviting potential customers until everything is complete. writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and staff. The entire film belongs to a septic tank fired onto another planet for viewing. What a gem. Convicts must have to watch this so they can commit suicide.
