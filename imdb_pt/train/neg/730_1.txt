I did not see the first movie and if something like that does not have great desire. <br /> <br /> Having just watched a few hours ago, I'm struggling to remember one thing about it. <br /> <br /> From what I can remember, the main plot seems to be a very annoying group of people staying in a house with that dishonest old woman on Friday the 13th and are being chased by man wooden planks. <br /> <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I am initiating a lawsuit against the person who sold me this film as I want compensation for the time I was missing in my life. <br /> <br /> I'm going to pay Â£ 1 to get this movie out of my hands ...... oh wait I already gave it to a "friend".
