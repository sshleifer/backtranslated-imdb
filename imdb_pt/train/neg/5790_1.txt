This movie is ridiculous. Anyone saying that the acting is great and that the cast is superb has never seen a mediocre movie. The acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you encounter. Lame. I feel that all other "growing" comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers. I was not too impressed with the plot, but just wanted to see a beautiful field in Oregon, and there was some decent cinematography - but the cast was anything but inspired. I think that this movie also ridicules the generally noble suggestion that something deep in Amerindian culture was ignored and perhaps lost and that reviving is worthwhile and possible. He puts jokes in the wrong and obvious places, and makes me think it was written by the State Department or something. Back to the drawing board. Even suggesting that this movie deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics as Harold and Maude is absolutely retarded, and following the same line of begging and pretense and "joking" as is rampant in this film.
