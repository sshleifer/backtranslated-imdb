If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let her be a kid. But prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio. <br /> <br /> After watching a movie as good as Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see what they do in Indonesia. It seems the only idea is to make money, but no one seems to seriously work on Indonesia's image in the entertainment world. That it is a "global" world does not seem to emerge in the minds of filmmakers in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them like "Made in Indonesia" with a taste of the west, they get away with it. <br /> <br /> OK, the story is good to begin with. And it could have become a good movie. But has the director never thought of the fact that a musical needs, first of all, live music OR at least a good reproduction, and secondly a good choreography? In this movie, the playback is so bad that it makes you want to cry right there in the movies. Every word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or whoever sings, and is extremely annoying as you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but in the end I thought it would be cool to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. Hardly dancing, they jump here and there, lift their legs up, and that's about it. Well, at least there's a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a good candlelight dinner is so much more romantic, do it!
