I read the reviews before watching this movie, and I did not believe them. I love bad movies and I expected it to be medium. It was not. This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look great. The film contains bad acting, bad sound, messy plot, bad makeup - and it made me so bored that I hung up. even nudity was rubbish! Did they have a budget for this movie? I do not think they did. You can tell if you will like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. If you want a good goy gory movie you will see toxic avengers 4 or even blood camp. Avoid this crap - I watched on TV and felt cheated, so do not spend anything with it. The best part is probably the end.
