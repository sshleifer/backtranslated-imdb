As a fan of horror movies, I try to watch all the significant news of this genre, especially those that are products of my home cinema. And I can say that the "Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as his Russian title) is one of the weaker films between them. First of all, you can not scare a child, you walk so slowly and so predictably that there is no place for true horror. Frankly speaking, it's bad on every point: from the silly plot (I do not know why the Russian producers / directors decided to turn the classic story about Ukrainian witchcraft into a modern and ridiculous thriller in the US Do I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer? does not excite a little) and to the work of the terrible and cheesy actors. All the actors, including the main Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, who are very famous in Russia, look like wooden dolls or something, and it seems that they did not even bother to play, they only spoke their speeches without any expression. And in the end I do not understand why they filmed this movie in English with Russian actors? I think it was your wrong turn. At least they could pitch some American or British actors into the main parts to make them seem more convincing. The same I can say about the so-called "small American funds of the city", which were filmed in Estonia and look like it. The only positive moment I found in "Power of Fear" is the visual effects. They are not great, but good for the Russian movie. And the music is good, at least it does not irritate me. That's why I give two stars. Overall, if you want to see good horror movie? do not waste your time and money on this boring movie. And if you're looking for something that claims to be a Russian terror, I advise you to find a copy of "Viy or The Spirit of Evil." It really is the fantastic film based on the same novel of "Power of Fear", but much, much better.
