My grandmother took me and my sister to see this movie when it came out in theaters in 1998, and then we bought the tickets, the popcorn and the soda, we went to the movies and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not applaud loudly, I remember hearing some people say they did not like it, I did not like it, I thought it was kind of stupid, and it would not be worth it. seeing Eddie Murphy was hysterical about it, but besides him, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at the parts of it, I also remembered that the other people in the theater barely even laughed. And what I really thought was bad was making the animals talk, because the talking animals only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally a mutt! I said that beyond the hysterical turn of Eddie Murphy he brings, this movie is not worth seeing, it's pretty stupid. I saw Eddie Murphy in several movies and I thought he was funny at these, I just said he was the only funny part of that movie, I also did not see Eddie Murphy in the movie really "great ", The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a movie that I really recommend you to see, because besides Eddie Murphy, you probably will not like this, especially because of the many talking animals in it! <br /> <br /> I will give this film a rating of 3 stars in 10 possible stars.
