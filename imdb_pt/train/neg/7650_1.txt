I know I'm a minority, but ... Uwe Boll is as talented as a frog. Not even a frog; Just a frog. He recalls a hundred other untalented hacks that make one useless useless after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? It's a fucking party. Slater's talent is only minimally used, leading him to believe that he has other things (like his failed relationship) in his mind. Reid introduces himself as if he had forgotten his acting lessons, been severely hit in the head and MADE to forget his acting lessons, or have one of the worst directors in movie history. I am voting on the third choice, myself, although the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done anything I've gotten the least pleasure from. Frankly, I'm glad he did it. I was worried about Bloodrayne competing with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now, I am confident that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean NOTHING, to worry. <br /> <br /> This ranks a rating of 1.0 / 10 for this confusing and confusing crap-fest, from ....
