I saw this movie when it debuted. <br /> <br /> It was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed messages with another person simply by helping them and guiding their hands. <br /> So suddenly these children, many of whom were not even watching the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed (they could be staring at the ceiling in some cases), but their moderators their eyes were glued to the screen. keyboard, began typing abuse messages from his parents and other people, sending parents and child welfare agencies into a concern, left and right. <br /> <br /> All this proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder, opened it for the child and said "enter the image you see", then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator, one fold would fall, revealing another different image. <br /> <br /> So while the child may have seen a dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Increasingly, the name of the digitized image was what the moderator had observed, never what the child was shown. <br /> <br /> So who was typing? Never the child. <br /> <br /> This movie still had a disastrous turnaround with, as the Australian poster said, the person who molested the child in the film was in the situation trying to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert had never put her son in that place, he would not have been molested, that's what the movie says. He was better under his supervision. <br /> <br /> If I deliver my child to your organization for help and he is molested, do you think I will listen to all that you have to do? say after that? It is unlikely! I think it's a safe bet that all those accusatory messages that these kids were typing that this movie was based on, have never accused anyone inside their operation like it happened here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I remember that the film did a very good performance of Gilbert as the mother of an autistic, but other than that, the film really did not do much. <br /> <br /> The worst by far was the child typing in the end for Patty Duke, and we heard the mechanical voice read back to what he typed. . . . . "we won!" This child was molested. If you cut my leg and I take you to court and you're found guilty of harming me, assault, whatever, then that's legal justice, but it does not bring my leg back. <br /> <br /> Better, in my condition, I will see this as a hollow victory. <br /> <br /> Whatever the chance that this child has in what is perceived as normal, only autism is further damaged by sexual abuse. <br /> <A 'normal' child has enough to deal with such an experience. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely superficial to think that you should look at any situation and go 'we win' if that person is found guilty. on court. <br /> <br /> Just a bad manipulation of a situation and circumstances around here.
