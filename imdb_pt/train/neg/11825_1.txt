This film is a blatant copy of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the movie appearing on IMDb give recognition to the original author, but I did. I do not see this at the beginning of the film, just a credit at the end saying "suggested by the book Silas Marner." Suggested? It was a complete imitation of all the essential elements of the story: A battered and sad old man, a poor, lonely craftsman, has all his money stolen. One night, a child wanders to his door while his mother lay dead in the snow outside. The man takes her and takes her until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. It was he who begot the child during an illicit affair years before. The battle then follows on who should have legal custody of the child. <br /> <br /> In this and all other aspects of the film, the story is exactly the same. In just one I can find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but that may have pushed Mr. Martin's acting skills too far. Also, he has his hair dyed in a mixture of carrot juice (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more like the clown he is)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes, which this eccentric comedian can not resist to bring to the story that have no part in it and only harms the depth of the story. Like when the child cries in court declaring that he can only be happy with the man who raised her all these years. This is broadcast in the movie by the girl who applies nasal decongestant to the bridge of the nose to make her cry! <br /> <br /> It strikes me that legality and integrity within the film industry allow this film to be made. If I were an administrator of George Eliot, I would insist on redress. If I were Steve Martin, I would send the profits to that property or to the poor. At the very least, it should be titled Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin. Or, better yet, removed from the files! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope it is - reject it completely and notice Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation in the 1980s.
