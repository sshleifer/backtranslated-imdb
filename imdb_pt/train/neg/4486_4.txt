What the hell was all this? I saw The Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular film ever made. What has already possessed the Wachowski brothers to make this film is beyond me. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can not argue with that. Basically, this whole movie was a lot of talk, and do not get me wrong, I have no problem with talky movies, but all the talk in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless load of driving. Then there would be a fight sequence that lasted a long time, then a more meaningless maneuver, then another fight scene that lasts a long time and everything accumulates for the greatest anticlimax of all time. A bearded guy talking a bunch of incomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> In addition, Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet. I knew he was not a good actor, but this was beyond a joke. If you watch your movies in the order they were, it would appear that it gradually worsened as you went. God knows what your performance in Something's Gotta Give is! Keanu Reeves: The only wooden board to become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first film, this was a great disappointment. If you have not watched the first movie yet, I suggest watching it, but do not waste your time on this crap. <br /> <br />
