Return to Cabin by the Lake only ... was missing. It must have a very low budget because a good amount of the film must have been filmed with an ordinary video camera. So within the same scene - you will get some quality camera pictures and simple video camera shots. It makes a very strange mix! I think they should have found some way to not do the "home video" type effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing it IF you've seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you have not seen the original CBTL ... you will never want to see it if you see this first! It will probably seem extravagant too and turn it off even from worrying about the original.
