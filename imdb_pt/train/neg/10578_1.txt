Terror fans (I'm talking to over 12, although if you're under 12 I apologize for what you might consider an insult): In short, if you enjoy having your imagination disturbed by telling well-written stories punctuated by unpredictable Well settled scares, and delivered through convincing performances, then I can vividly recommend - AVOIDING THESE VAPORS - made by directors who seemingly long after their sale by date. It's no coincidence that almost every episode seems to have been made in the 80's. Do not put the blame squarely on the shoulders of some of these older boys (or actually the 80's) because where we would be without certain Argento films, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (Actually, Clive, WTF you're doing in "I'm glad to see Romero had the good sense to give a foul like I'm sure he was invited to attend ...). finger to creator Mick Garris, whose credentials include the challenging logic and TV disapproval of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, "The Enlightened One." Perhaps it is an indication of the state of television today. that we are so hungry for the good horror of TV that we applaud any cheating that networks excrete on our sets? Unfortunately, maybe so. <br /> <br /> Usually I do not see the point of adding a comment that does not discuss the flaws and the merits of a production , I would only rate accordingly. However, as this series is woefully devoid of any merit (perhaps with the sole exception of theme song), I write this as more of a warning than a criticism: DO NOT MISS YOUR TIME AND MONEY. If you do not agree with me, it is more than likely that you have not seen enough decent horror. Perhaps the earlier films of some of these directors were a much better place to start, but if these "Masters of Horror" were being evaluated only in those works, they would never be allowed to graduate, even with a bachelor's degree. Unless, of course, they were studying for a degree from the University Of S ** t.
