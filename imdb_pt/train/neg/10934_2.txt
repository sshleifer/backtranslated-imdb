First of all, let me say that I am LDS or rather, I am a Mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically gave the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something redeeming in every movie I watch. And this was no exception. It has its moments of redemption. But they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that bothered me so much was that it seemed like Halestorm was ashamed of our Church! In the LDS Church, the congregations are called "infirmaries" and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". NEVER ONE TIME is one of these two names mentioned. The Church is never mentioned by name and "standards" are as far as they mention what our Church believes. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the directors are really aspiring to LDS or LDS? This movie had a lot of potential! It could have really shown our Church in a positive way and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe. Instead it was just slightly fun and left a lot to be desired. If I were not LDS, I would think Mormons are stupid, stupid, and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> It is NOT a movie that I will recommend to my non-Gentlemen friends. <br /> Sorry, Halestorm. You can do better than that!
