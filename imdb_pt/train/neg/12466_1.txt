I could not wait to receive the DVD after hearing so much about the movie. What a disappointment! This has become one of the most confusing movies I have ever seen. There were so many characters introduced, some similar to others, that it became impossible to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the film, since he was not involved, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up after an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I could have considered the breakthrough to see if the end was better, but after so much confusion I decided that the chances of improvement were minimal. A co-worker told me a lot of the movie "comes together" at the last minute or less. I was glad I did not waste another hour waiting. I gave the DVD the next day.
