Leave it to Paul's "sex in the brain" Verhoeven to come up with a useless and despicable youthful version of the story of the INVISIBLE MAN. If he directed a Pok√©mon movie, I'm sure he would turn it into a kind of massive orgy. I do not care about sex or even sleaze (check out my other comments) in the movie but frankly, it's obvious that the director has a mind of a track and he could not see interesting aspects about an invisible man story than the perverted implications that comes with it. Too bad, because it might have been nice if the movie did not spend so much time with an invisible Kevin Bacon to touch women. The cast of the actors game does what it can with the script of a note, but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally wasted here. <br /> But then what I could expect from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, incidentally, is a lot more fun than this fluttering and bad movie.
