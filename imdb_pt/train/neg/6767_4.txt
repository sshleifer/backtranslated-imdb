I can go through this movie once, but I doubt I can go through the second time. Gently amused mainly by the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon (think about Something About Mary) and the resurgence of a more serious performance, Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun joke that the Love Bug was, but it's watchable. One of my main drawbacks of the film was that Herbie evolved into the antics of R2D2 most of the time. I was bored with the effects of the headlights the second time around, about 30 times they were used, and the front bumper folded the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, meaning the "single digit bracket" kids and do not expect too much with this movie. <br /> <br /> _X
