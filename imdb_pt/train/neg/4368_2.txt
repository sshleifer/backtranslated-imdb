This was released on the DVD market by Alpha, and is only for tough fans of Boris Karloff (as Moi). It is not a horror movie but a drama in which Boris is a scientist who struggles to kill the husband of a wealthy woman in order to get the fortune needed to continue his work. But once the dying victim changes his will and leaves nothing to his wife, all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> It is satisfying to see Karloff as another selfish, sinister type, and part of the acting is unintentionally hilarious (especially from the lead character Mona Goya, who is absolutely a laugh as the woman with two arms crossed. But proceed with much caution.
