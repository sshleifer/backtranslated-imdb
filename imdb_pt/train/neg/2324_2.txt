I agree with the comments of other users in which the two main roles were well represented, this being the guy who played the role of Gary Gillmore and Giovanni. Too bad the story was so boring. Not hearing about the story I did not know of Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber, but how wrong I was. The whole movie was just talking, talking and talking about his mother and father. The only cool scenes were the flashbacks in which the father lost his temper. That was the only interest I received from this borefest.
