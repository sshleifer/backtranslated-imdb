I rented it thinking it might be interesting, and it could have been an interesting story, except it was told in such an uninteresting way. Difficult to follow, strange edition, disjointed plot, the characters grumble, after all, a terrible waste of time. I just could not get into it and I did not care what happened to the characters - not even Ian Holm could save this movie. Unless you need a cure for insomnia, I would ignore it. 3/10, and that's generous.
