(1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell The bad girl of fifteen Melissa is new in a deserted city and it is not long before the people around her begin to die. The detective has to join the clues with the help of his good daughter Nancy Drew, played by Dana Kimmell, a former student of Friday. Local Native Americans are the main suspects, as they seem to disrupt biased residents. All of these events lead to the killer's revelation at Melissa's 16th birthday party. <br /> <br /> This below average slasher is not very memorable. It was made for TV sensation, without much punctuation, in addition to the very tacky theme song of the title character, which touches a few times. Lines like "the killer will turn us into cabbage salad." Fits standard slasher scripts from the eighties. Marci calls Melissa bad reputation and somehow they immediately develop a friendship. Apparently, Marci sees how difficult it is to fit because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This film would be difficult to do today, with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting several free close-ups of it. The social commentary on the Indians was not developed enough to be taken seriously. I'm very surprised at the very high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on the honorable birthday party tradition to create an intense carnage sequence, but I feel I could not deliver. But on the bright side, casting such obscure movies on DVD gives hope that others will follow.
