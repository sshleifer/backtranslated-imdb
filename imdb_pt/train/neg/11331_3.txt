With all due disregard for this "epic" of confusions and readings from George Stevens Sr., I can only imagine that the "legend" of James Dean could survive this tour, I assert that the studio bows to box office "giant" their own 'gigantismoses'. Neither Rock nor Liz was much better. Let's just say that the televised "Dallas" was the authentic "heir" even though the "Tans" of the last days - like Lay and DELay, not to mention our "president" of the United States of Amurrika, play an important role. a subversion of iniquitous global dimensions. I've never read Edna Ferber's original, but I'm going to question it's head and shoulders higher than what's on the screen here. And all those who paid well, I imagine, "supporting" notable and celebrated actors, "Giant" is, for me, at least a dwarf of scarce merit, no matter the promotional campaigns.
