There is not much to say about it. Gammera is a kind of tortoise that breathes fire. He is released by a nuclear explosion. He heads for the earth and begins to destroy buildings, tanks, and other types of garbage (ah, yes, lines of force. I almost forgot). At the same time, at the beginning of the film, he befriends a boy and instead of simply throwing him away or smashing him, he puts him on the ground. Safe. From then on we have to watch this plump-faced idiot appear and flee, appear and flee, appear and flee. For some reason, Gammera is able to hear this boy 20,000 feet away. Well, the plot is to try to get Gammera to get to a place where he can be put aboard a rocket and thrown into space. As usual, the monster is clumsy and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammera costume). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans) uses enough ammunition and firepower to solve the national debt and, of course, it's no use. They should know that anyway. We saw many monsters stepping in Tokyo. Do not put this on the floor because they can be fun, but they are not very good.
