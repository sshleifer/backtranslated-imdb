This was a complete disappointment. The performance is not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I felt I needed to stop it, but unfortunately I managed to finish a little embarrassed with the whole poor movie. It's all right. if you're o.k. with cheesy moral frames and do not mind watching a movie that misinterprets Whitman. If you want a fictional fictional story, go ahead.
