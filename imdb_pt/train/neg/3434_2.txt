I'm a big fan of horror / splatter, I even like horror movies that some people consider stupid. I also like blood. The more the better, as long as you have a point. <br /> <br /> After reading the comments of others on the site, I was sure that this movie would be a little gem. But to my great disappointment, it proved to be one of the most insignificant films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the dialogues were stupid, the plot was useless, the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who had been dead for the past 2 years. Generally I think all these features make a great horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I won 11 euros to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you really like nonsensical things (eg, "violent" movies) avoid at any cost!
