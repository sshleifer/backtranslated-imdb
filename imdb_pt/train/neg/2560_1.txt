Well, I watched it last night and the only thing that did not make it completely horrible is that it was straightforward. There was no beating in the bush that this boy was the Antichrist. However, the film was just poorly written. For example, they never explained how they made the dentist's accident an "Accident" or, in the end, how the cop miraculously ended up in the house in time to save the child without the police being called yet. The death scenes were really bad and not fun. The kid they chose to play Antichrist was annoying and they really could have picked a better kid. Just do not waste your time watching this.
