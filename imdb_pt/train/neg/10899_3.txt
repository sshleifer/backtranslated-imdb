Cockroach and mind-incredibly dull story and acting. Not a single good line, not even a line bad enough to be good, and no delivery memorable. Even the recording roll included on the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun they were having. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic, and the antagonists could not be frightening or believable. The "homoerotic" tones were uselessly insipid and unsatisfactory, confining themselves to the boys who caressed their breasts while they were flaccid in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to enjoy it, but a little action could have at least kept my girlfriend awake.
