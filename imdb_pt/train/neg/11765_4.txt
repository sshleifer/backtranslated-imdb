You know what you're getting when you buy a Hallmark card. A banal and banal verse that will cost $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we have Ernie Borgnine, ninety years old, coming out of retirement to let us know that, in fact, he is not dead as we think. Poor Ernie, he's the poor soul who married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this film, Ernie jumps on his feet first and portrays the grandpa who joins his long-lost grandson. We've seen this before. You may like this movie, but please do not say you were not warned.
