The perfect murder is thwarted when a wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who commanded this episode), who kills her husband with a poker game, has the misfortune to be visited when she is about to Move. the body outside .. a crazy crazy escaped dressed in a Santa suit (played by a Larry Drake). She takes care of her life as she tries to find a way to hide her husband's corpse. She decides to use an ax as she kills Santa's killer who loses several chances of cutting off the woman's head to frame the killer for her husband's murder. Santa's killer hangs her in a closet and chases the woman's daughter as she tries desperately to free herself to save the child. <br /> <br /> This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT only recycles tired material involving the old "Santa Claus Kills" theme, while adding the routine of woman-murderers-your-husband-for-a- man-with-her-was-cheating-with-a-man-with-used (add nauseum). It is essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a corpse that she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There is nothing new or refreshing in this storyline that practically crosses the motions. Not one of the highlights of the show.
