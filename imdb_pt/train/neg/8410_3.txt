This movie is all flash and soulless. The actors had a lot of passion in the numbers, but these numbers often did not connect with the movie and sounded like independent music videos. And no effort was made to make the numbers sound like they were happening right in front of you, each sounding like it came from a studio, essentially sucking the whole life of the songs. Off the stage, the performances were all boring and unfulfilled, especially Hudson, who essentially plays the same angry, "strong" black woman (she's stubborn and selfish) we've seen before. There was absolutely no depth to her character, nor to any of the other women. While I think the film wants us to believe that Hudson's character faces difficulties because of his weight, it's really his own refusal to do what's best for the team that puts him in trouble, making the film's end completely meaningless . The Hudson's Oscar is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she emitted emotion (although this was often mistaken, but that was the writer / director's fault), but when she was just acting, she did nothing to perfect an already subscribed character. The character of Eddie Murphy is the only one with a bow, and he did a great job, but still not worthy of Oscar. The only actor who actually brought something to the role was Danny Glover, who picked up a small, relatively unimportant character and did something real with it. There is nothing here to sink your teeth, no drama or heart, or even laughter. The placement of the musical numbers was so bad that sometimes the movie almost seemed to be mocking musicals instead of being one; the number Hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long if it were not for a Family Guy piece. The movie has no idea what it's about and I felt insulted by the last few minutes. It's a big, tedious waste of time, and it really is the worst movie I saw in 2006, and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with.
