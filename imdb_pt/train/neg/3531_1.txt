This movie is now my meter against which all other movies will be compared ... like in "Was it as stupid as Revolver?" I was also in the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival last night where a room full of more than 2,000 people came out in a mysterious silence after being absolutely stunned by 2 hours of sheer nonsense. Jason Stratham would have been amazing if he had a purpose. In the first 10 minutes, he gave a proposal of Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (of Soprano's fame), which makes NO SENSE ALL! Then there's some footage and Ray Liotta wearing embarrassing bikini panties, then there's animation, Ray Liotta's naked butt, many filming, teeth grinding, art house wants to be pretensions and more of Liotta's embarrassing body that elicited laughter at all exhibits . . I'm not sure if that was the reaction he was looking for ... not 5 times anyway. Everyone in this movie thinks they are smarter than the average bear and Guy Ritchie thinks he is the Yogi Bear incarnate. The story lines may have gone nowhere, but the stance was out of sight! The only way this movie could have been worse is if Madonna herself was in it.
