Idiot and stupid fool on a jet set up hours later by mechanics who never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chasing a decades-old Porsche racing car driven by Lee Majors with Chris Makepeace as the techno fugitive Who can put McGyver spare parts on a radio receiver that can pick up all frequencies simultaneously and that has somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high quality explosives in a perfectly peaceful society. As stupid as it sounds. Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can at least be forgiven, claiming that this was only his second film.
