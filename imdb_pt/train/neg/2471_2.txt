I remember when I was little when I was in camp and we camped under the stars. There was always someone there who would have a good story to tell that enveloped the woods that surrounded us and they always frightened me. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, I checked in hopes of being one of those movies that had a supernatural being haunting people in the woods, much like the stories that were told in the camp. Well, to my astonishment, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is very bad. The story begins when a family of three people is driving to their winter hut, which looks like their normal suburban home and nothing like a hut in the woods, and they come across a deer. Well, it seems like the local backwoods were actually hunting this particular deer and are very upset about the town folks. The film spends a lot of time following the daily activities of families rather than reaching the point of the film. It was not until the last 15 minutes that we actually had some action involving the "wendigo". My suggestion is that you stay very far from this movie. This will leave you wanting your hour and a half back.
