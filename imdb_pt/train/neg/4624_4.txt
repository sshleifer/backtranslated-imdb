This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was disillusioned for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone in an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) He was not an android, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have its origins traced back to this episode if they did it correctly. Actually, the modernization of the sex bots is in the news as I speak. <br /> <br /> Robots were not new to the movies or television when this episode was made, so they could have at least made her act like one. His flesh would then have added a scary element. Instead, it becomes a beautiful love story about two humans on a distant star. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone has always stretched the imagination and credulity. Usually no one cared. But this episode seemed paralyzed by a Calvinist morality that avoided what would have been masturbation with a machine, or simply carelessness.
