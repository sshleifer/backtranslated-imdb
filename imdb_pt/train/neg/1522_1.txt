You must know that I am the type of person who watches the worst of the movies until the end, often out of pure morbid curiosity. I even watched Leprechaun all the way before giving in to the temptation to tear out my eyes and hit them. You should also know that this movie was on my VCR for less than half an hour before I took a frantic jump to the stop button and ran back to the rental store just to put as much distance between me and it as possible.
