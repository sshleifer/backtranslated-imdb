After we count the word f, oh, about 22 times in the first 10 minutes of the movie, we heard some really bad actors talking about a woman and a horse, and practically acting like 12-year-old boys. be disobedient together, well, we hang up. Leaning on gratuitous swearing and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser Hollywood movie, the product of unimaginative and untalented writers. <br /> <br /> We took a second chance, thinking it would certainly improve. No data. Later, my boyfriend jumped the rest of the film in case of improvement, still no data. <br /> <br /> The main character had a cool bike. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to anyone, except perhaps really immature teens, or frat boys.
