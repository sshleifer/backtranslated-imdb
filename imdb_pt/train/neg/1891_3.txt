Documentary about the nomadic Persians making a treacherous crossing of huge mountains to put their herds in the grass. Watching this silent black and white feature, spoiled in part by an oriental twink-twink-twink soundtrack that could not have been used in the original display, is even more dull than it looks. The spectacular landscape is lost in a small black and white screen, and there is an absolute failure to establish any kind of plot. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but I despised this film despite the similarity of the theme. The physical difficulties alone are not so interesting.
