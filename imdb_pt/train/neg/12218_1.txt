Very bad. Very very bad. As a colleague who aspires to be, or at least - sniff the catering table on a film set, I find it difficult to criticize the independents who actually made a movie of any kind. However, this movie ... oh dear. <br /> <br /> Frightworld does not want anything more than gross exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and to try to make it conform to the most common standards is a mistake. And to be fair, it's more fun than - let's say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not much. So I will not try to criticize, just let me ask to play some remarks. <br /> <br /> 1) If gore is the point of the movie, should not you be able to see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you hire three men of sound, make sure that at least one knows how to operate the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, your main maniac must be more frightening than a smurf doll. . Difficult I know, but really ... <br /> <br /> 4) There are a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of you can hire very cheap. Take someone who knows how to frame a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs, this does not mean that he should do this every couple of seconds. <br /> <br /> 6) Congratulations on getting the girls to take off their tops, but next time, girls that tops that we want to be taken. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell the story or set a mood. At least in this kind of movie editing, it should sell the gore jokes. A chainsaw suddenly appearing on a character's stomach is not scary, it's sloppy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all the acting was bad. Jack was very good and I liked acid when she started to fight back. There were some cool pictures, unfortunately was played on the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better movie. I also like moxie from Frightworld. Next time, now that they have a kind of movie on their resumes, I hope everyone will aspire to something better than Colman Francis. Please upgrade at least Ed Wood.
