Okay, so the introduction, with its offer of a free coffin for anyone who dies of fright during the movie, is so dumb that it's funny. And so the first "scene of the skull" is so extensive and without suspense that it is funny. The actual plot of the film is a little decent, there is at least a little genuine food to think about the behavior of the characters, and the twist in the story is decent as scary movies. The acting is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie does not fall completely as a 1/10 movie would do. Not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even the 2nd lowest. If I'd just finished reading the screenplay, I'd say there was potential for this movie to be decent. It's just the horrible direction and production that spoils the movie. So it's a bad movie, but there are a lot worse things out there.
