This was a dreadful short disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was horribly awkward; I did not feel any feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered hurriedly and seemed out of place. They could very well have been quoted by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was non-existent and watching an American Rochester seemed odd. He could have at least tried to make a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but it just did not work out. I felt like I was watching the highlights of Jane Eyre, where the main pieces of the story were randomly placed without regard to the flow of the story. The setting and the music were all very good, but I could not feel any of the passion and love that should have been between Jane and Rochester and the film made me totally indifferent. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the 1983 version of the BBC with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now those two are brilliant adaptations.
