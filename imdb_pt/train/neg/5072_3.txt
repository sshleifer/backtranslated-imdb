And a self-admitted to boot. At one point, the doctor's assistant refers to himself as Igor. Working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers could be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this film does not spend enough time exploring the premise. Most of the time on the screen is torn between the domestic dispute of the comatose girlfriend and the pursuit of the brain killer. He tries to be a sci-fi / drama / thriller, but fails to deliver on any of the three. <br /> <br /> As a remake of Frankenstein this is missing everything that did the original good. No one calls the doctor crazy or threatens to expel him from the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening an eye and the incredible computer that makes it happen is not even shown. When the experiment works, there is no compliment, and when it starts to go wrong, there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any suspense about who the killer may be is broken by showing him progressively in the same room with everyone else. possible suspects. Finding the killer is as easy as opening a file and interviewing a person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco as a scenario is both exaggerated and underutilized. The opening sequence confirms that this is happening in SF, a cable car plays a major role, leads live on a Victorian hill, Pier 39 makes an appearance and the final showdown takes place at Golden Gate Park. More specifically over ten feet of cliff side in the park - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times. Once the basics of the obvious scenario are rounded off, no further attempt is made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> Acting is the only saving grace here. Keir Dullea shows a good variety and takes some genuinely emotional scenes. Suzanna Love portrays the recovery of a coma as well. Tony Curtis gets only a handful of lines and twice the evil guy faces most of Frankenscience, explained by his assistant. The blond boy also beats very well in his tracks. <br /> <br /> I also gave an extra star to the scene where the husband heads south of the bridge, makes a return in an unrelated parking lot. , and then it is instantly back on the bridge to the north. It takes a lot of something - bravery, ignorance, timing - to try to slide the one by the viewer during the chase of a single car.
