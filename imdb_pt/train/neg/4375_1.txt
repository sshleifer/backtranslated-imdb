Less self-conscious and much less pretentious than COUPONS OF A BEAUTY, this Kazuo Komizu gore movie is worth taking a look at (at least once). <br /> <br /> Despicable sneakers escort the actresses / models to a remote home. in the woods, in order to molest them sexually. Unfortunately (for horny boys), a long-time demon who lives in the woods has already targeted the girls for fun. <br /> <br /> The thing even ends up having fun with the boys - this is IF you consider beheadings, dismemberments and masturbation with severed "fun" members. <br /> <br /> Once again, everything sounds better on paper than it does and it sounds in the movie. <br /> <br /> Just like Komizu DEAD DEAD IN TOKYO BAY with his ineptitude, he also deals with this effort and is only saved by some audacious violence and some great pictures of white panties. <br /> <br /> Do not buy hype, though, or you. I will be very disappointed.
