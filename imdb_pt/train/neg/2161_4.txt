Ira Levin's success on Broadway hits the screen with almost no flesh on his bones, a plot of mystery with just a few tricks and twists, but no one is worth worrying about. The frustrated writer Michael Caine plans to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it on as his; his devious plan may include the murder of the talented kid, who has Caine's wife in arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is terribly dead, with Caine doing everything an actor can to keep up. Dyan Cannon is mischievous as his wife (she's too clever and clever to be passed on as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle part of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the best writer. These three characters, and Irene Worth's troublesome neighbor, are so undefined that what happens after the set is barely recorded until well after the second act has begun. Sidney Lumet's direction is shocking and confusing, the setting is not convincing and poorly lit, and the ending is a total disaster. The actors struggle to give substance to the script, but with such fine material, all we see is their laborious efforts. * 1/2 of ****
