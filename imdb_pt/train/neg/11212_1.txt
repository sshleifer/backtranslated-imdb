The premise of this film was decent enough, but with sub par act, it was just bland and bland. The film does not work because of the nature of death, it was accidental, although it was a murder, it was not how the guy set out to do it. Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that kind of makes events like justice to some degree. There is no excitement in this movie. The first 20 minutes or so are just this woman calling her sister and listening to her message. It was boring and annoying. <br /> <br /> With a little polish and better performance, it could have been really good.
