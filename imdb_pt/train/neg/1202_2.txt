A dog found in a local kennel is mated with Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit & run. The puppy does not want time to do like Donald Trump and dismiss the Mexican housekeeper, who festive. Only the father suspects that this canine is more than he appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic dog. So it's up to the father to tell the day. <br /> <br /> This late 1970's made for the TV horror movie has little to do except a feeling of nostalgia out of place. When I saw this as a kid I found it to be a tense nail biter, but revisiting it as an adult now I realize that it is just lame, boring, and not very well represented at all. <br /> My note: D
