No one goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and waits for the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same is true for most cheap-rent horror movies, especially those that Roger Ebert dubbed "dead teen movies." The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a dead teen movie, except here the teens received the superficial appearance of military trainees. Some will argue that the phrase "is just a movie" when questionable facts are raised in a film review, but I have always believed that every good fantasy must be rooted in reality to be effective. In Hills Have Eyes 2, we believe the main characters are military in a training exercise, but they look and speak like high school kids camped out in the wilderness. The dialogue is horrible and often vulgar in excess. Although the films are not nearly comparable, I kept imagining that these "soldiers" were in Platoon, and shuddering with dread. <br /> <br /> Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and uniforms: radio broadcasts are performed as adolescent phone conversations; a Colonel is addressed as "hey, idiot" by a soldier. And no one seems to have a clue what to do, or any sense of command structure, when things start to go wrong. I think of aliens from James Cameron, a film of pure fantasy, and even these futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers, despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I try to start watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10, and I judge its strengths and weaknesses from there. You have to allow allowances for the material; there's no way Star Wars is as good as a movie like The Godfather on equal terms. But both are excellent examples of their kind. <br /> <br /> In that aspect, while Hills Have Eyes 2 is a very terrible exercise in amateur and immature writing, it is only modestly worse in this regard than the typical dead teenager. Movie. On a technical side, the film seems to have decent production values ​​and is very well done from that perspective. Scenes that are meant to shock, or that are intended to evoke urgency or suspense usually work. So while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death, there are certainly far worse horror movies in circulation. <br /> <br /> It pays to take a look at those who like this kind of thing without the usual fanboy luggage, or those who do not tend to think of all the movies they see, is either Best Ever or the Worst of All Times. If you do not "catch" horror, especially the Dead Teen variety, you probably will not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
