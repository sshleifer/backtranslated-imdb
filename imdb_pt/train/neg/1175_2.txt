Much has been made of Rohmer's use of digital technology to "fill in" the background. Sometimes works well, the scene in which Grace and her maid testify from afar the execution of the king is particularly impressive. At other times, it gives the film a strangely amateurish look, resembling a home video. However, the main flaw is that the sheer artificiality of the scene creates an alienating effect on the viewer. We know what we're watching is not real, so how can we feel about the characters? To be honest, I do not care what happened to the Lady or the Duke. <br /> <br /> The other major failure, I regret to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead role. She is in almost every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance. OK, she is speaking a foreign language, but she is unable to express real emotion. Her emoting in the scene where she tells her friend Mme de Meyler (an excellent performance by the debutant Helena Dubiel) to see the head on a pole caused an embarrassing laughter in the audience. Also, watch your hands when she is expressing emotion! <br /> <br /> All in all a very disappointing movie, especially given the positive reviews on this site.
