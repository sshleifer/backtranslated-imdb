This is really the most terrible movie I have ever seen. I just have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put it into practice. <br /> <br /> Production patterns are atrocious. There is no pretense here in cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting and sound are unbelievably gross. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes, saving us the time to watch it. The hysterical neurotic girls in the center of this play have no credibility whatsoever. <br /> <br /> I would urge everyone to avoid spending time or money on this Title. It is truly atrocious. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
