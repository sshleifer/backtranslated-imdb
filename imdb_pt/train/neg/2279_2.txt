Boy, what a mess this mess was. But it only lasts an hour and I only paid a buck for it, so I'm going to live ... unlike the whole cast of this 1933 clunker that is now all covered in dust. <br /> <br /> Either way, a small village begins to have bodies appearing that have been drained of all its blood. Local peasants start talking about vampires, of course, and a little louder after every body is found. or whatever it is, played by the incredible actor Melvyn Douglas, tries to tell them otherwise. When he mentions the fact that the dead have a large hole in each side of the neck, instead of two nearby holes, the villagers say a giant vampire bat. The policeman insists that vampires do not exist and must be a human culprit who is committing the murders. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn does not seem too bothered. He spends most of his time trying to get into the pants of his love, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix is ​​the city's simpleton, played by Dwight Frye, who seems to have played the same role in all the films he made. He further torments the inhabitants of the city by taking bats and drinking their own blood. Lionel Atwill plays the city doctor who seems to be trying to help the policeman solve the crimes. he always stinks like an actor. The will is as cardboard-like as possible. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing ... many names to be a pile of guano. In addition to the terrible misleading title of this film, the alternate name, "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this film is also monotonous and heavy and simply silly. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie's point film is watching Frye, it's weird weird nails of the city, but beyond it, this movie does not offer much. And then when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect thing that required all this blood you will be really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made many horrible pictures, but at least it was fun and interesting to watch. of this movie as a lousy Lugosi without Lugosi and you will get an idea of ​​how miserably this mess was. <br /> <br /> If you can not make a good horror movie from 1930, at least put Lugosi in it.
