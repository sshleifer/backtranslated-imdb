Hard to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best, it made me skip a little surprise in a few moments. <br /> <br /> If someone forgets the scary dimension (failed) and looks at the other sides of the film, he is disappointed again. The performance is good, but not great. The story can be a little interesting at first, while one is trying to understand what is happening. But in the end, it is understood that there is not much to understand. "Scary" elements sometimes seem to have been added to the script for no reason ... So ... (yawn) Watch this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, like chopping carrots or looking at the clouds.
