Bah. Another tired and disorderly portrayal of a copyright work was never filmed. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Toni Collette is superb as always (being a real actress, you see), and there are some well managed handling cuts between scenes. There are even a few genuinely funny lines, and cinematographic work, soundtrack and editing are competent, plus a bizarre lapse in narration and conversation with the camera toward completion. <br /> <br /> But, ah, but. Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly very old (and in a very young case) for their stated ages. Worst of all, they're all talking about "Austinese," that quirky, self-satisfied falsetto song that could not be further from the way people actually talked about Austen's day (think Yosemite Sam, I'm not joking). This is particularly sad considering that it seems that we are finally seeing the disappearance of the equally farcial "Fakespearan" that Olivier and his comrades were so fond of shouting at the top of their lungs. <br /> <br /> And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She has always played only one character in her films, and she remains true to form here, scouring her whole range (grumpy) in the first ten minutes, then repeating herself for the rest of the film. There is absolutely no chemistry between her and her admirers, nor any apparent reason to be interested in her. <br /> <br /> In short, there is very little reason to observe Emma. It's a pretty nice adaptation, but if you're going to pack a movie full of anachronisms (that is, a seemingly thin lead that can not shoot an arc or deal with an era accent) then you can do it properly, far superior " Clueless ".
