I was not totally impressed with this movie. It was originally called Sin Eater and should have stayed like that, considering that's all that was said for the last half of the movie. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the movie had to do with the rest of the movie. It was very slow and we chose Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. That was a sad point. <br /> <br /> In short, I'd say if you're into things that deal with the Catholic religion, but do not expect an exorcist or stigma from the movie. It will surely fail after a few days and the news will be released.
