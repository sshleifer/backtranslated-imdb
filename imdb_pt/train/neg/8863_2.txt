Howling II (1985) was a complete 180 of the first film. While the first film was overdone and scary. The second was despicable and tacky. The production values ​​are very bad and the performance is atrocious. The werewolf brother's anchor of the first part wants to find out what happened to his sister '. The "scene" of the first film was poorly recreated. A skinny, lean-looking woman accompanies bro '(Reb Brown) to the ancient country (Romania) to unravel the mystery of her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears from time to time as a sort of sage / guide for both. Sybil Danning and his two biggest assets appear as Stirba, the Romanian werewolf boss. She also suffers from a bad morning face affair, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There's nothing good about this stinking man. I'm surprised, Philippe Mora directed this photo because he is usually a good filmmaker. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch (no, not the content, but the movie itself). To get around the movie, you'll get a very bad "punk" performance from an aspiring "Damon" Babel. Maybe if they forked a few extra bucks, they could have gotten the real deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> Better to avoid unless you are desperate or you have lost the remote control and you are too lazy to change the channel.
