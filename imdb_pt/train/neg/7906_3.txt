There is a knock on Korman as he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing supporting characters in Mel Brooks' films ("High Anxiety" comes to mind). He is not, however, a person who can take a movie in mourning papers or anything less. This is basically an imitation of "Gremlins", following a tradition of films like "Critters" and "Ghoulies". Nor is it a good imitation, along with "Ghoulies", but with a much clearer tone, since it's not nearly as dark as the movie. In fact, this is very light and sparkling, and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling. Although I have given a 3 for a scoreboard, this is just because there is a movie that is even a worse immitation of "Gremlin". If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know what I'm talking about ... the infamous "Hobgoblins". This one has a guy finding a little bug somewhere underground (I've only seen this movie once a long time ago, so I do not remember everything clearly) and it gets pretty friendly. However, this creature quickly becomes hostile and of course more are generated and that is the movie. Much more miss than successes in the play department, and it is also very bad to see Korman playing the evil brother. Best to skip this, but you might want to take a look just for fun.
