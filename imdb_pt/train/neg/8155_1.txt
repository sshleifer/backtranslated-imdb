I really prefer Robin Williams in his most serious roles (eg, Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World According to Garp). These are my favorite Robin Williams films. But enjoying the day, though well represented, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> <Any good story will have its ups and downs. This movie, however, is a giant down. I do not need a Hollywood cheese festival, but I have to have something beyond 90 minutes of complete and utter despair. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far a person can fall. The answer? Who cares.
