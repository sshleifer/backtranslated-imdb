This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie has nothing positive about it. Some of you really like this movie! I saw many Dracula movies and I liked everyone I saw, but when I saw this movie I said to myself, "What the hell is this?" What an idiotic movie. Now they have Dracula becoming who he is because he is Judas. For those of you who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty that he hanged himself. You have got to be kidding me. That's the dumbest reason I've ever heard about why Dracula has become evil. Who asked for a reason anyway? What a piece of ** this movie is. Whoever invented this excuse for a movie must be defeated. Even Dracula is awful. If you've ever seen this movie, you would not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Should this title impress me? Do not waste your time or your money on this garbage.
