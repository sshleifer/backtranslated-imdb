This movie should have been called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed ​​is mostly about hot cars and pretty women and almost no plot. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was level A was the cars. The acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was fragile at best, and the plot was almost non-existent. I just watched this movie to see how bad it was and although it was really bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was fun. I just wanted them to have shown Eddie Griffin breaking Enzo somewhere in the movie. After all, do not pay for it, do not go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
