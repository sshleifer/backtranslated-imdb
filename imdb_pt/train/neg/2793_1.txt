That's at the top of my list of the worst movies I've seen so far in Starz on Demand. They seem to get each straight to the DVD that they can find and put here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently, anyone with a digital camera and a tight budget can create a horror movie and put it on TV. To be honest, that sounded terrible from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to have an open mind about low budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were movies that worked around their low budget or in other cases just demanded that the low budget be great. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. <BR> You already know the plot now, I'm sure, if you're reading this. Either you heard about it on Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this boring page. It's about a pathetic and whiny girl we met for 3 minutes in an incredibly bad heavy metal video. Whoever joined him must have thought it looked very interesting, but he really did not. Anyway, she kills herself. Then she has someone. Then some murder begins. It is truly memorable and as completely average and boring as possible. When the first shot is shot in your apartment, it sounds quite like a popping popcorn. Was it the best sound effect they got? I could find a better sound effect to use for free, (without copyright) on the internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Do not let the other reviews claim that this is a 10-star movie fool you. They are obviously either distributors of the movie or maybe even the director trying to convince you to think that this piece of junk is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Risible.
