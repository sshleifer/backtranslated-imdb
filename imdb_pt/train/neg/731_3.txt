Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) is witness to the brutal murder of his mother and the suicide of his father Morty (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of friends in his family's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party. While playing a game where the guests confess and face their worst fears ... Mike tries to invoke the spirit of his late father. It is soon discovered that Morty's spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the hut. The statue comes to life and the bloodbath begins. <br /> <br /> Most F / X is not very convincing and the film takes on a teenage theme of cheap slasher. Stale story lamented acting. Cast members include Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.
