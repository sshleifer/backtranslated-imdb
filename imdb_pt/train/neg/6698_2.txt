To say Funky Forest: The first contact is a bad movie is a euphemism of incredible proportions. I can actually get into a good art film, even a surreal and distorted one like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because these movies really have something worth discussing when the credits roll. <br /> <br /> <br /> FFFC tries in every way to be so deep and intellectual, essentially there is substance in this movie. This movie is badly made, the visuals in this movie are not inspiring, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie .. I laughed for GUITAR BROTHERS, but this was immediately eliminated by something completely unnecessary, and irrelevant. He tried to be profound and meaningful, I think, but it's just disoriented absurdity. Freshmen film students without a camera could create something more interesting. <br /> <br /> The guitarist and the stand-up routines among the satire earn 1 point each, everything else is just a bad rhythm, pseudo-creative and heavy attempts being as good as films of other REAL directors like Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Give me some time. I am convinced that people who are enthusiastic about the FFFC are doing this because they have no idea what they saw, because they were nothing but minor pertinent statements here and there blended with stupidity and combined until you vomit in your own shoes. <br /> <br /> This film was an extreme disappointment, coming from the top that was Survive Style 5+, a movie that really has meaning, combined with excellent use of scenery, cinematography, catchy dialogues, funny moments, good track sound, excellent performances, fantastic rhythm and flow. FFFC presents the exact opposite in every sense, annoying scenery (20 minutes looking at a bland beach at night? A completely white stage? Alien balls floating in the white space? A dinky school hallway and then a ... school hall?), Terrible cinematography, forgettable dialogue, nothing funny or humorous, save the fact that you have wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack, amateur performances, uneven, disconnected, and often flat out dragging rhythm, zero flow. <br /> <br /> There are those who claim that this is what makes FFFC a great movie, which is so unconventional in every turn that it is its pure genius. This is simply a way to caress your own ego, because "unpredictable" can be a good quality for a movie if it is not accompanied by "boring", "insane" and "terrible." Personally I talked to two people who admitted to me that the FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but the elusive rave of the art elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a ... "Hey, it was very good I liked it ". <br /> <br /> I'll put my foot down, this movie is slop, I do not care if Roger Ebert says this movie is the best thing he's ever seen since he lost his own virginity. "The Emperor's new mantle," I say ... this movie is not an indication of other psychedelic films / travelers from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies (even on a low budget), and no one can honestly compare to Survive Style 5+. Watch FFFC only if you are interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a tight budget.
