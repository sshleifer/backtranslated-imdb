The Enemy Mine monster somehow entered a small community in the mountains where he moved in. He is being hunted by a doctor who has become vigilant and is about to exterminate him. This killer, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, rides a motorcycle and tries to save a group of kids who chose to have a Big Chill weekend right in the middle of the monster's territory. Decapitations and lots of blood are basically in place to divert attention from the story that coexists as a bad version of Dr. Moreau's Island (and yes, it's worse than Val Kilmer's).
