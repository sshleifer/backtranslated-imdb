I grew up a Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I do not believe it anymore. I'll give the film praise for being as good as the average-life movie of the week. Moderately interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is mellow and a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind must be the noisiest, loudest of all Christians. No curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor who plays the man who runs the United Nations pronounces himself "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler", just like Bush. Is there any code of Christian honor that ordains that since Bush asserts that he is also called by God, that all Christians should cover up their ignorance by falsely pronouncing the word in the same way as he? I LAUGHED A LOT! I actually had a hard time taking the film seriously after that. After the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the movie began to look like bundled and manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I did not find it here. If you're looking for mindless fun, stop here - it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
