This movie is bad. If you are thinking of watching, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about 5 seconds (the topless scene of Amanda Carraway). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think high school probably has better acting. The plot makes no sense at all. The set was pretty lame, and it was not good to make fun of anything. It was just boring and very very bad! I watched this on Starz, so I thought it had to be at least decent. The mini description sounded as if everything was fine. The girlfriend apparently kills herself for no reason at the beginning of the movie, after which you have to watch a horrible music video. The transitions between scenes are VERY abrupt and it's as if someone puts a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transpose them. It just cuts from one scene to another without softness. Kind of like my random change of talking about how bad the movie is, to explain why the plot is a drug. The audio gets low on some spots where you can barely hear it, then get loud with gay screams of horror played at random spots in the movie. It's the same sound every time. This is now officially the worst movie I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Performance: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Plot: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-meter : 1,000,000 / 10
