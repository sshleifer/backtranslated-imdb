Once again, a classic film has been redone with predictable and disastrous results. The title is fake, just like everything about this movie. The period is not convincing, and the leads seem too young and too insipid to even be criminals. The film by Arthur Penn had style, humor, a point of view and was made by talented people. Even if the 1967 version did not exist, it would still be an unnecessary film. The 1967 version deviated from the facts, featured a glamourized version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was exciting and groundbreaking for 1967, and had some remarkable performances that allowed her to care. This remake of 1992 seems to be drawn from the original film, not the truth, and the actors of this version are inexperienced, unattractive and not at all interesting. By all means skip this and hope that the 2010 version is better. Could it possibly be worse?
