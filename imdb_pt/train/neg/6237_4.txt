The statistics for this movie have been well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this film has received the praise it received. Al Gore is certainly a great actor. He looks so worried. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this film, there are political nibbles and references to his political career scattered throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a righteous man who not only talks but walks too. When Carter thought we needed to save energy, he turned off the White House thermostat and got warm wearing a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we have to save energy and claims that we are creating global warming as it travels in its own private jet. How much energy does your jet use and how much more pollution does your jet create? How much energy is needed to heat Gore's pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could save electricity by using smaller appliances and making sure to turn off everything that is not being used. But if we did, the energy company would react to a 50% reduction in energy, calling it a "50% loss in revenue" and recovering its losses by raising rates by 50%. So "just turning it off" would not be a good idea. <br /> <br /> This film is a veiled call to allow the Big Goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving the planet Earth.
