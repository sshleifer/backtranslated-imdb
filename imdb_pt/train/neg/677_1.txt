I shudder to think of what people might have thought of environmentalists after seeing this arrogant, overbearing piece of cinematic trash. Consumed with plenty of Indian bounty hunters and space clowns to buy a store for the new age, Starlight makes anyone who cares about the planet look like a glass caricat idiot. The plot ? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a flute that uses the underwear model on a mystical quest to avoid the imminent environmental collapse of Earth. But first they must defeat an evil alien who does not look so much like a refugee from a bar on Castro Street. Fortunately, they have the mystical grandfather Willie Nelson together to help (who seems a bit embarrassed with the process, as it should be) along with cheap F / X buckets and reams of nonsense music. <br /> <br /> Of course, the clumsy script helps obscure the film's banal plot and impressive pace, but that's just the tip of the iceberg of this melting film. Everyone involved in this film must have their union portfolios revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science.
