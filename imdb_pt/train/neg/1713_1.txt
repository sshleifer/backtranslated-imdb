If you have not yet seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you have not seen it. A contest like "make your own horror movie in a day" could not result in an entrance than in the indignation of an insult to the intelligence of any viewer. Sheets forgot a story, a plot, an appropriate dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up. It seems to be recorded on the handycams' crate and copied into even worse equipment. Makeup effect consists of black mascara for the zombies and yogurt being poured over people's heads in order to simulate their skin melting. This is nothing more than a home movie and also a bad movie. Just fun to watch for friends, family and neighbors who were willing to appear for filming. I can not, for my life, understand why this mockery of a product is listed on ANY serious magazine or movie site - I have homemade wedding party movies that are much better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. The ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II sequel is just more of the same crap.
