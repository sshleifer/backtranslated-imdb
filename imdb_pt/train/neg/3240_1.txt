This is the first Guinea Pig movie in Japan and this one is the sickest, in my opinion. A bunch of guys tortured a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at the moment, I will say that these films are not real! They are feigned horror movies that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes are disgusting, but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and kick the floor near the girl! And how stupid it seems! Sound effects are also unrealistic and do not make sense. Other scenes include animal intestines thrown at the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, tearing her fingernails, worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, her eye pierced and mutilated in horrible details and things like that. Very sick and moody film and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematic significant. This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig, although not as bloody as the next, Meat and Blood Flowers, which tries to be as shocking as possible. The experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I've ever seen and the closest thing to discovering it exists. This is still (of course) fake (s / n), the only difference to the genuine "snuff movie" is that no one dies or really hurts in this movie. I can not recommend this to anyone as this is so bad and repulsive. Those who consider this a great horror film do not understand anything about the cinema and the real meaning of it. I watched this as a curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant these things are. They work only on the level of shock and this is not a very valuable cinematic achievement. The Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest movie I have ever seen and Mermaid in Manhole (Coba 4) is perhaps the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. So those are very extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
