Just film well about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back home. She then returns home to find that everything is not well and that she will have to find out what happened to her sister and why. <br /> <br /> That's the kind of thing that works, but it does not work. t quite. I can not really explain why this did not work, but it was good enough for me to wish it was better, or at least hit the little things - like having the girls playing the twins in the flashbacks. be closer in size. I think maybe this is wrong, there are many little things that are wrong.
