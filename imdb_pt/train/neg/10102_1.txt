If there ever was a movie that deserved a great fat zero score, it's that pile of crap. I love zombie movies and even the bad ones usually have something for them, but not this atrocity. I really started to feel angry watching this movie because it is so insultingly poor, I can not believe the people responsible for it would think that this was acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no plot and the non-plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not react, act, or otherwise look like humans. The entire film is also filmed in two rooms sparsely decorated to vaguely resemble the places they should be. The whole thing is a nonsense mess, it's not going anywhere and when the zombies finally appear they look like crap and do not do much. <br /> <br /> I could make a movie better than this, so you could and so could someone who had never seen a movie before. It's unfortunate and arguably the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the worst movie of all time. You will notice by the way that the only positive comments give a 10/10 and urge you to buy the DVD. I can not imagine someone neutral genuinely thinking that this is a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and this is generous.
