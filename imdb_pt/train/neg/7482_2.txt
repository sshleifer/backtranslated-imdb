This movie is not so funny - a waste of big stars, who seem to be caught up in their own stardom that they forget. Only bright moments belong to John Cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress - you almost fall off the chair with a helpless laugh as you dance to Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" in high heels, a fur coat, and a delicate hat. The rest: FORGET IT!
