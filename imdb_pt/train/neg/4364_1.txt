I find it difficult to understand why this piece of junk has been repacked. The only saving grace in the whole thing is Ariauna's body in her sexy uniform. Your mood is also to be enjoyed. It is a definite advantage, but unfortunately, it would take a magician to save that garbage. However, she must be positively recognized for her heroic effort and true professionalism. I can not say the same for your co-star Lilith in her tearful voice that irritates your nervous system. She appeared disinterested and gave the impression that only her presence on the set was all that was needed. All that said, besides Ariauna's performance, is in fact total junk.
