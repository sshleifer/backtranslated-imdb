Lots of silly holes in the movie. First we see him watching his master practice kung-fu and die in the middle of his practice. I'm fine. And then, at the end of the movie, we see him wearing kung fu that he learned only by observing his master when he was still a child. Is it even possible? I do not think like that. <br /> <br /> This show is purely for Jay Chou's fans, and the film lacks depth in terms of character development, cinematography styles and plot unfolding. <br /> <br /> Did anyone notice that the captain of the basketball team (forgot his name) and the idolized player Li Xiao look so much alike to each other, insofar as you think they are the same person? Long hair, boy-sun-like, tall and strong. The two appeared to have come out of a mass-production factory designed to produce products that made teens scream madly at orgasm. Not that these two actors had anything of value to contribute to the film as a whole to the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were stupid and not funny. The scene regarding Jay Chou's 4 Masters coming back to help him on the basketball court degenerated into a nonsensical plot as they began attacking their Royal Rumble-style opponents. Worse of all, when the 4 masters won the fight, the fans began to applaud and the game continued. Was it really a WTF? time. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to Jay Chou's excellent kung fu skills. How he acquired these kung-fu skills is a mystery because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by watching his master. <br /> <br /> And then his father long ago left the den to recognize Jay Chou as his long-lost son seemed only a little too quick for the director to close the film. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a Jay Chou-flick (instead of the usual "chick flick"). Watch only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you're one of those whose tastes in the movies closely matches those on IMDb's list of all-time best 250 films, then this movie is not for you.
