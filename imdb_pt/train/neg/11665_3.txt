I liked the film a lot, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not contain violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and does not need them at all, holding my attention all the time with the visual, the story and the words interspersed with wisdom. <br /> <br /> 1 Some of the accents in foreign languages ​​have made dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] There is unnecessary excessive use of profanity (especially the word F, which is the only reason this film was rated R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that holds it throughout the film except the final resolution in the last minutes is unpleasant due to the long-lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to the loss, living in the depths of bitterness and depression for a long time. [4] I will not recommend this movie because of 5 seconds of background narration, which did not add a bit to the side character to which it applies, or to the movie - it only attached me to the movie and got stuck in my movie. brain through the entire film and then: the mother of the main character of German descent, watching old World War II films, "secretly roots to the Germans." There would be no "local color" or art if the Nazis won the war. I do not know any German today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazis won World War II.
