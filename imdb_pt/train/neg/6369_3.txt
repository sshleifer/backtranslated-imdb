The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria magazine. The article made this movie seem interesting. Well, it's not. This was a very annoying, kindly written and directed film. All the actors in this movie are terrible except Faye Dunaway, which is always a joy to watch. But a lot of time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with the crows and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has an Argentine accent so thick that you can only understand every word he says. Also on hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultra-bland love interest for Gina Phillips. The Bottom Line: This movie is not scary. There's only one good scene and the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given that star, but I gave only three because I really like Faye Dunaway. But even she was not that good at it.
