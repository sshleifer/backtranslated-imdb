This is only the second time I feel compelled to comment on the film. The first time was probably the best movie I have ever seen and it was for Memento. Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I've ever seen. had the misfortune to see. In addition to the two scenes that contain naked women, there is nothing in this movie to get you out of the trash heap. <br /> <br /> Let's see, apalling effects, clich√© script, bad acting and about 90 minutes too long. My wife and I laughed most of the time, not believing how bad it was. Surprisingly I watched until the end, as I did this I do not know! AVOID!!!
