I gave this movie a rating of 1 (Awful). The only reason he should have a 1 rather than a big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines, no matter what terrible stuff gets thrown in his way. <br /> Mira Sorvino is so out of his element. here, as a spectator, one simply can not overcome the fact that he is really in such a play. <br /> <br /> Stupid stupid story and horrible production. DO NOT waste your $ video lease.
