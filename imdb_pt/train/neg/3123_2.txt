I felt mine was watching this ... but it seems that is the reason for the insanity running in the family in this movie. It does not make much sense, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's latest films and it's just his on-screen presence that lends credence to everyone. It's sad that all the great legends of horror movies in the sound era ended up being reduced to starring in such low quality trash. Marginally, Boris came out a little better than poor old Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and gives credit for trying to keep this mess together. The strident background music does not help and distracts from any lucid moment. In addition to Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast is nicknamed a strange, clipped English monotonous one that resembles the kind used in pornographic films of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's House of Usher that this is taken away, but you'd have a hard time finding a large amount of Poe in the final article. <br /> <br /> Still, there are much better movies with Boris Karloff at his best, look for them and give him ample space, unless you also want the curse of 'brain shrinkage'!
