To begin with, I have to point out the fact that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you do not know why or what. When you finally figure out things, you just realize that it's nothing more than a perverted opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate children ... The characters are rather poor and the actors (especially the young ones) do not help. much to make them look credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is an excellent actress, no matter if the film is pure garbage. <br /> <br /> The only positive things to say about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that debutante Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions, and he filmed some scenes that are very intense ... Well, maybe next time ... <br /> <br /> * My price: 4/10
