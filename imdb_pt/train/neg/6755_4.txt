Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she expects when she goes to a pool party with a fine co-worker. When her boyfriend and her playmates say they belong to a "Murder Club," Maddy takes it seriously and heads straight for "level 3" by attacking the brains of a woman in a garage (to crush her car!). But is Maddy also wearing a plastic mask and killing other members of the group or has someone lost her? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film (originally entitled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly conceived. , full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ridiculous twisting end, off the left field. Some of the dialogues are frankly laughable. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the support cast was atrocious. However, I was able to keep up with this release of the Full Moon completely entertained. There is enough skin and blood and it is the perfect type of movie to sit with a group of your friends and separate. Terror fans can also enjoy the cameos of Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (one of the first victims). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
