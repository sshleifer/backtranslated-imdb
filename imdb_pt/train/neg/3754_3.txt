As a longtime fan of the entire Star Trek series, I found this episode disappointing, and I wonder if the liberal use of flashbacks with Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (a lot of pain, and the death of a crew member) was a device that saved money, as well as many of his "bottle shows" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final appearance than that for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Faithful viewers (in the world of Star Trek, is there any other kind?) Also been deceived. This was the last episode of the second season; So the season ended "not with a bang", but with "a groan."
