This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. He almost always rips out the kind of suspense and manages to mess them all up. <br /> <br /> There is not a single line or good character in all the confusion. If there was a plot, it was a belated reflection, and as far as acting is concerned, there is nothing good to say, so I will not say anything. I honestly can not understand how this kind of nonsense is produced and actually released, someone somewhere does not at some point think, 'Oh my God, this really is a load of shit' and call it a day. Your crap like this that has people illegally downloading, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you have downloaded, you have not wasted your time or money Do not waste your time, this is painful.
