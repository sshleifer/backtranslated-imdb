Maybe television is so brutal one day. Perhaps "Big Brother" was only the first step in the direction Stephen "Richard Bachmann" King described the end point of. But enough about that. If I spend many words talking about the serious subject of this film, I do exactly what the producers expected in choosing this material. It's the same with "The 6th Day". No matter how primitive the film is, it provokes a discussion on the subject, which serves producers as advertising. Let's not be fooled by it. The social criticism suggested by the plot summary is merely an alibi to enable the production of a violent and speculative film, more for the sale of videos than for movies. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book. I do not dare criticize Stephen King without having read it, but when I saw the film I thought that they could not make such a horrible movie with a good book: in a typical 80's set with 80's music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger is seen as a cop fleeing the killers inside a cruel TV show. The public is celebrating. <br /> <br /> Together with `Predator`, this is definitely Schwarzenegger's stupidest movie. 2 stars out of 10
