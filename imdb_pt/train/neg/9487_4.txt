The cast though nothing special, everyone does an OK job, the story seems to be a good idea, the script is bearable and the ending has a good turnaround; So, what's wrong with that? <br /> <br /> For starters, special effects are really bad (if it was done in the 60's) it may look cool, but in 2003 there's no excuse for such bad pictures. It makes me laugh that the cover of the DVD says very proudly "of the creator of special effects of the Jeepers Creepers". <br /> <br /> Secondly the direction is weak, this film simply does not capture the essence of the story, a doctor. feeding the souls of the hospital inmates with the Devil (or demon-like creature) must be tense or scary; It just is not. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a very poor movie, and although bearable and sometimes mildly entertaining, it is still better to leave it alone. <br /> <br /> a little sad 4/10
