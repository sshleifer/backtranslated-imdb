Kubrick knows the king. It looked so promising in the spring of 1980, I remember. So the movie came out, and Kubrick's cultists have been fighting with the King's cultists ever since. <br /> <br /> King's cultists say that Stanley Kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it. Kubrick's cultists do not give a shit about King's story. They talk about Steadicams, tracking images, camera angles. This is a movie, they insist: it should be considered by itself. It turns out that both fields are correct. Unfortunately. If one sees it purely as an adaptation of King's novel, "The Shining" is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of failed narrative gambits. <br /> <br /> I used to blame this on Kubrick's screenwriter. Writer Diane Johnson (author of Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) has a reputation as a social-customs novelist. Perhaps she was chosen for her subtle understanding of marital relationships or family dynamics. But the small working-class town of Sidewinder, Colorado, does not exist on any map of its francophile universe. <br/> <br/> Kubrick, the Anglophile, probably found it congenial, however. He, of course, is the real author. And considered by his own merits, his script of "The Enlightened One" - with its blend of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implicit reincarnation - simply does not support logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I am willing to consider Kubrick's "Shining" on its own terms. I'm even willing to accept this as something other than a conventional horror genre film. But it does not succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation, and madness. Analyzed in any way, the film virtually collapses. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of Overlook Hotel real? Or are there only in the mind-first like prescient nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance, then how his father's hallucinations? It is noted that whenever Jack Torrance is seen talking to a "ghost", in fact he is looking at a mirror. One notices how the hotel's frozen hedge-topiary labyrinth seems to symbolize Jack's atrophied and complicated psyche. But if in fact the "ghosts" of the Overlook are purely manifestations of Jack Torrance's growing insanity, then who exactly leaves Jack trapped outside the hotel kitchen cupboard, so that he can go to his climax to wield the ax? <br /> <br /> And anyone can explain, with a serious face, that Nicholson black-and-white photograph (useful as "1921") as a tuxedo-goer party that leaves the left field and wall of a hotel ballroom during the final seconds of the movie? Should we seriously conclude that Jack Torrance's Bad Craziness stems from some kind of "past life" experience? (And what if you swallow it, since when reincarnated people should be exact physical replicas of the past?) Maybe Kubrick did not care about his story. Maybe he just wanted to evoke a climate of horror. Whatever the case, the film tries to protect its narrative bets - to have both, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This movie has not improved with age, and certainly does not improve with repeated views. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that some moments of fear, claustrophobia and general strangeness have been scattered all this time. long movie But those spouting Blood Lifts, seen repeatedly in Danny's little visions, are absurd and laughable. And Jack Torrance's infamous phrases ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Just pierce the dramatic tension of the film and dissipate its narrative energy. (I know: I sat in the theater and I heard the audience laughing in comic relief: "Wow! Glad we do not have to take this seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea - or completely cynical - during those scenes in that Wendy wanders through the empty hotel while her husband tries to purge him. A foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting dead in their party hats? Yikes, now I'm really scared. Given the brilliance of Jack Nicholson over the years, it can be assumed that he gave only the kind of performance of creaking eyes, of wiggling the brows sought. Shelley Duvall's performance, as a kind of Don Knotts female version in "The Phantom and Mr. Chicken," is best ignored in silence. <br /> <br /> This film simply does not succeed - not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. It probably deserves a 3 out of 10, but I'm giving it a 1 because it's been so GROTESQUAMLY over-rated in this forum.
