I was not impressed with this movie, especially since I went to the movies with my family in good faith to see a movie that received the 12A certificate here in the UK. To my amazement, this movie was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but not good for watching with kids). This movie was sometimes very rude at times with fart jokes, being run over in the groin etc ... and most of the movie is not very funny. The premise of the movie is that Calvin Sims, who is a 2-inch dwarf, comes out of jail and steals a giant-sized diamond, but is forced to put it in a female bag. Then the rest of the movie sees him passing by an abandoned baby, entering the women's house so he can get that diamond back. <br /> <br /> So far, I enjoyed most of the production of the film. Wayans Brothers - but this movie is certainly catching the cookie. <br /> <br /> Good advice - wait until it arrives on TV or cable.
