This is the version that even the author hated because it is so weird. They gave a 'happy ending' and they changed a lot of the dialogue, and it's just a big pile of saccharin. The stage manager is very good, I believe he originated the role, but everyone falls into that 1940's acting style that is just posing. The great feature - the music. This has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth looking at a record store. Overall, I think the 1989 version of Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller is far superior.
