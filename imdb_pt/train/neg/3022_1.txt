I was very excited about this movie when I first saw the previews. I usually see a preview so good and I buy the film bluntly. Something told me to ... you know how to watch it first. I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with that role. In the second Pirates' movie, when I left, I went to see. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it. I think this has to do with her hair and having to cut short for Domino. <br /> Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know or care. I do not know who she was in real life or who she was in this movie. I did not care about her character and even Keira getting partially naked was not worth the movie. The direction was definitely missing. The writing was banal and superficial. The editing was horrible. I do not care much about his style or his excessive misuse. There is a place for this. Good examples of hectic style, MTV, color edition (I do not know if there is an official name) would be the Fight Club; Just off the top of my head. Even the state's enemy had a semi-similar editing style in the pieces. It was used with taste and was not used as a crutch. I mean, this is the same guy who ran Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott, please give me my time back. <br /> <br /> I understand that many people liked this movie. I think the idea that you completely love this movie or hate it completely is a fair assessment. Frankly, I hate it.
