Poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no suspense, no original settings, he uses the same cabinet / under-the-bed / person-behind-you-in-mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring , and not in a prenunciating way, and the fact that no one ever "really" is killed (at least not on the screen), which in turn zaps any suspense can conjure it out and makes everyone feel more cheated by spend money on your admission ticket .... it's a horror movie w / o any LMAO horror. What you see is what looks like someone has taken a jar of ketchup and spread it on a plastic sheet. <br /> <br /> You have to be a teenager who was sitting there screaming at the movies and being scared to have liked it, or you were high / drunk at the time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and do not bother writing reviews that unless I really hated it or liked it a lot. <br /> But this movie is AMAZING and I feel I have a duty to warn you not to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of filming again! <br /> <br /> It's one thing to rent a "bad" movie on Weinsteins blockbusters, it's another time you have to watch it in a movie theater. <br /> <br /> Also, in case you want some nostalgia for remake, forget it! This is not a remake, nor is it a re-imagination. It's not scary, it's not engaging, it's not satisfying enough to be "funny," as others on IMDb have stated ... it's just obsolete and booooring. <br /> <br /> Here's what you'll get out of this movie: Remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech must be having some sexual affair with JS Cardone from "The Forsaken" has gotten another role as a killer (because he's as scary as my poodle, and too cute to kill anyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone back to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of person would not care about the ball when they decide to announce the candidates for the king and prom queen and the fiercely competitive girl does not show up in any way? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste your money like I did. The "original" sucks too, but it's more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis's fans, though not as bad as this crap (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but once you see it, you'll understand why I say what I say).
