This film is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the role of Lane's perfect betrayal wife. They have changed the second half of the film to adapt to the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even so, the film has the full Unfaithful features, although it fails to reach the original. It was cheap and cheap porn from Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone she dared to show. Emran made more roles like this and was even dubbed a serial killer. In the future, if Indian directors plan to retake a film in English, they will have to investigate the viability of the plot with the Indian censors. Although the film was bombed at the box office, the actors received undue recognition. In the future, filmmakers should be a bit more careful about remaking an Oscar-nominated film. <br /> <br /> All told, this is not a family movie, so take extra care while watching at home with your family.
