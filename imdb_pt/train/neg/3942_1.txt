Oh my god, what a horrible movie. The film has all the right people involved, unfortunately not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to watch this I would be even more upset. This movie is unwatchable. How could Tarintino engage in such a slow and uninteresting film? No wonder there has not been much distribution, everyone involved must have been ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated camcorder and my big toe. It's very annoying, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some in my eyes. This must be some kind of bad joke. Do not bother with this movie. If someone suggests that you should watch it, kill it.
