I thought this movie was a disappointment that I hoped would be much better than it was. I'm so glad I did not pay to see this movie and that I did not sit in a movie theater for this movie. Where to begin this film, the acting in this film was medium, the humor was terrible and only the general plot of that film was not special. I thought this movie should be great, but it was no more than a waste of time. I think the acting in this movie was terrible, none of the actors in that movie had chemistry, it just was not there. I think maybe if we had a different actor playing Kirk than Jay Baruchel, it could have been better, but all the time I watched this movie he seemed tall and I did not have the feeling he was not acting in this movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this film were not names and had very little effect in this film. The humor in this movie was not funny, there were some liners in this movie that were good, but nothing worth telling your friends they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith struggled with this because he could not decide whether he wanted a novel or a comedy. I honestly think he needs to stay with the Burger King commercials. I think this movie could have been better if the writers had gone to a different director. The plot of this movie is just like any other hot girl just OK love story face? Boring I think it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a disappointment nothing. I honestly would not recommend anyone going to see this movie. I think you would have more entertainment at the dentist than in this movie. So save yourself from the agony and just do not see.
