Comedy-anemic drama, an unhappy, seemingly hasty affair, featuring Cher as a soulless housewife who gradually befriends the murderer who was hired to kill her for her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the hired gunslinger, has adapted the script of his own game, with theatrical arrangements and dialogues back and forth that quickly tires the eye and ear. An air of sadness hangs over the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky can not get Cher out of his perpetual funk (she's apathetic). Despite all the great talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is fraudulent, with no substance for the story and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 of ****
