Wow, the scariest thing about this episode was the price of the houses 40 years ago. I'll start by saying that I'm not a fan of narrated episodes. If the story / actors / etc. it's worth it, they should be able to broadcast most of the narrative without having to read it, reminding me of characters who can not think on the fly, but rely on teleprompters. The psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some like that sort of thing, not my cup of tea. They might have kept the narrative, but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or maybe from a newspaper reporter or something. Small things like the Peugeot being at home, which has a singular entry of half a circle, but it seems that he parked the car in the tree he was in, because it can not be seen on the road or on the estate. Sloppy editing, as she pulls into the garage (by what seems like the hundredth time) exactly who are those two guys you see at 24h30 walking toward the car as she walks into the deserted garage? The Dolly's close-ups were also exaggerated, as some of Jr. High's theater students discovered the zoom function on their camera for the first time. I could keep separating, but this can get almost as annoying as this episode. He kept crawling and the real purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the filming they had filmed from Elaine driving the Newport convertible. I expected to see the Chrysler logo and jingle music while a voice told us all about the 8-track player, auto top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about his is that she's gone all of a sudden. No loose ends tied up, nothing explained or finished. Not that many noticed, I suspect that most had already changed the channel or dozed off until the end.
