Wow, what the hell! ... I said that I wanted to become a specialist in bad films of all the decades, so I decided to start with this one. It was a pretty adequate choice. I got into this adventure to find some lost pearls and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I did not see anything of the kind in this pastel-colored mess. I have not watched many bad movies before, but I get the feeling that this is called "so bad it's good" probably because it's so unintentionally funny! First of all, there are inaccuracies. There are plot-related inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies, and psychological inaccuracies. The latter in particular are as insane as Van Damme's buttocks in that blue spandex. Extremely sticky lines also exist and I will not even start talking about some of the hilarious action moves. There is not exactly the bad acting of everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie, except in a particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank, who is a totally stupid character. And to tell you the truth, I was really surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing the twins. He managed to achieve a different tone and humor in the two roles that convinced me. But the film was mostly pretty bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a big movie studio ... which is now bankrupt.
