I have two good things to say about this movie: the setting is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work on in terms of dialogue and direction). However, that said, I found this film extremely tiring. Seeing dry paint would have been more fun. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening sequence where everyone is talking to each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that was said on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is littered with cliches and slicks, not to mention unending incidents of flatulence audible by Falk. In addition, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to smile or cry. There are some sequences that are playing, but they are all played for laughter. If schmaltzy, sentimental and "fluffy" appeal to you, you'll love it. But if you were expecting something with more substance, watch a different movie.
