I was able to get a preview of this with the help of MST3K, and, oh boy, even with the riffing, this movie was terribly bad. Imagine someone whose competence with a camera can be made by a monkey. <br /> <br /> The highlights (what little there was) came from the special effects, which were "OK". The acting for the most part was also "OK"; though nothing special, was of a superior quality to other B movies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is terribly bad, the camera work often looks like they just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed it along. The story (if you can call it that) is so full of holes that it's almost funny. Never explains why the hell he survived first, or need human flesh to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue is almost stupid. The film's climax (if any) is absolutely laughable. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid this at all costs.
