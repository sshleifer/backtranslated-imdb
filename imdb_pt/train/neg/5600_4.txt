Fulci experiments with sci fi and failure. usually in his horror films, we still have a lot of blood, but not here. Add some very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold a bar for 12 minutes and if they fall they are chosen. the guy falls down and has some kind of adjustment on the floor for about two minutes, until his friends, who were struggling to hold him, raise him off the ground. The city is an obvious model, but not a bad one. and the final explosion is, at best, laughable. And do not make me start the terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
