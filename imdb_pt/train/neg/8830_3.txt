Just so many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and worst of all a bizarre almost Hollywood-like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (this is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You also need to be thick skin for all types of politically correct tones. The conflict between whites and blacks was highly planned and one-sided. I did not understand why the author had the local black community behaving in an unacceptable way, he / she is trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> A truly bizare movie. Just watch if you like to get really bored with the holes in the plot and enjoy debating all the things that may or may not have supposedly occurred. <br /> <br /> But on the positive side, filming and acting are excellent.
