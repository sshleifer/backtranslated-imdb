Ya I rented this, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> A decent premise sets out an otherwise strange story with no real return, but at least it's shot well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases, this should be a slam dunk, but this little stinker swerves quickly. Cinematography is above average and the performance is mediocre at best, but the story and the writing are simply terrible. Slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far between without a real climax to the film. A mysterious mood is defined in the beginning but loses its brightness before any kind of horror appears, and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich ... The cover art is attractive and I suppose it is worth a rental if you are looking for low budget mindless dreck, but if you like a good story and an eventful end, reach for something else.
