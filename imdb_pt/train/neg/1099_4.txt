I was shocked by Tigerland's ridiculously unbelievable plot. It was a liberal's fantasy of how the military should be. The dialogue was hard to swallow along with the silly things that Colin Farrell's character was allowed to escape by his top officers. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking, "Hey, there's a reason why training is difficult. should condition soldiers to battle and turn them into a cohesive unit. There is no room for arrogant attitudes and men who do not follow orders. "I was rooting for Bozz to get his butt kicked because he was a danger to his fellow soldiers. I would not want to fight alongside someone like him in the war because he was more concerned with people's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit. <br /> <br />
