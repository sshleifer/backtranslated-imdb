Based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books and can be brilliant literature, this film adaptation really sucks because it's more like fighting sleep rather than enjoying some cinematic delights. The story is about an elderly couple whose son died and lives a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and where the main character is a rooster we hope someday will bring some money for an upcoming cockfight. I do not feel like saying anything else about this pretentious and useless piece, just maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that? No gracias .....
