there are three types of bad movies - cheap, boring and bland. the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless. boring movies are simply boring - if you do not get out fast enough, you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Tasteless movies really do have their advocates; but the fact is that they are masturbatory aids for very sick people. <br /> <br /> Only cheap bad movies are really funny, because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperately that they went beyond their limits. skills and resources available. <br /> <br /> Bo Derek is naturally boring and tasteless; Fortunately, fate and the lack of funds and skills to redeem it, making it look cheap too. this movie is hilarious and may be the last really funny movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time in a theater, may God forgive me; I was laughing so hard that I was rolling from my seat, and so with most of the audience. <br /> <br /> Of course Derek and her husband-promoter, conceived this film as, in part, a satire; unfortunately, the Dereks clearly lacked the necessary resources for this; consequently, the "satirical" element appears as the impression of some schoolgirl from the impression of a gay young man of the free impression of gorshin on the puzzle in the batman trying to pretend that he is robin - does not fly over our heads, has no idea where any human head can be. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some supposedly serious moments in this movie - it's supposed to be an action movie, remember - that are so incredibly extravagant, that someone wonders if someone squirting spoiled milk in the eye. <br /> <br /> As for Derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts-I can not imagine a photographic exhibit of less erotic nudity, she's so weird with those broad shoulders, I can imagine what anyone else has seen in her. <br /> <br /> As for the plot - as it is - well, it is not; Derek chases Africa and God knows why. then his father - Harris - pretends to perform at some maniacs show, and then of course there's the hunk'o'Tarzan who seems to have wondered about advertising without knowing that the subject changed - probably because he did not see a script - apparently nobody has. <br /> <br /> insignificant camera work, poor quality editing - if it were not for the 3-way with the chimpanzee, the movie would be unbearable - <br /> <br /> as it is, it's a real joke.
