First, the movie begins with a cop and his partner parked in front of a warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" cop takes a girl they had stopped to the warehouse attic while the newcomer stays outside and ponders what might be happening up there. The "bad" cop eventually returns with a heavy backpack, and the novice cop does not think there's any problem, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks, gets a nonsensical answer, and then he thinks everything is OK (for now). <br /> <br /> The "bad" cop repeats this process, and even once with a tit scene (it got a little better). But eventually people begin to realize, which took some time considering how obvious it was. A girl gets a voodoo curse, just in case she dies, like you do. Now the "bad" cop eventually kills that magically protected bitch, and then he gets rid of the bagged body. Since she put oogey-boogey magic on her, she comes back with a lot of eye shadow, which supposedly indicates she may be a zombie ... also, the magic curse does all the other girls become "shadow monsters". Some of the girls meet a guy, who is apparently a currency expert, and he offers them a ride (apparently they look normal to him). But when girls see other people, as the only girl's husband, he is frightened because she is hideous (some people freak out, but others do not even notice) ... a huge hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> So, to finish, the shadow monsters kill the "bad" cop, who ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene. It was as if they were trying to prepare us for a sequel! As anyone would like to see part 2 of this cow falling.
