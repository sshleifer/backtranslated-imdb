Where to start. This movie started out as something that looked like a "Darkness Falls" swipe. An old and disfigured woman who lives in the forest, giving gifts to children's teeth. Sound familiar? So that changes. In "Darkness Falls," the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her. The tooth fairy in this movie killed you, no matter what. Why did they need the rocker, their hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and his sister? I think the movie would be fine without them. It seems the producers sat and decided they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy had people to kill. While it's good to see a beautiful blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble head for a change. It's okay to rent, but I would not suggest buying it.
