Now, I'm the one to watch movies that have received bad reviews and say, "Hmm ... this is not so bad!" I loved The Cable Guy, and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep in mind, I did not really start watching this with high hopes, but I realized that maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad in a way that I could laugh at that. I was wrong. At no point during my suffering through this "movie" (and I use that term in moderation) I was close to being slightly entertained. To begin with, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I knew, an Amish priest would probably make a rapper better than him. The main character is simply annoying, not a character that is easy to like. Frankly, I'd rather eat a bit greasy from the bloody wounds of a Harlequin fetus than see that again.
