It's not a female movie but a movie for the gang. One of the worst movies ever made by a male director about women. Director Andy McKay simply does not know woman. Peaks of bad taste, humor style of American Pie, raw story, pointless, unfounded story, refuted characters. Ordinary costumes have come to life on the screen. Insulting and definitely not funny. I wonder how three good actresses agreed to participate.
