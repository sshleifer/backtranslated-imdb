I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the first feature-length film by Dutch veteran actress Monique van de Ven and, based on my observation, should be the last. I hate movies that are so implausible that you're separating just about every scene. This movie leaves you immediately scratching your head. at the beginning, a young photographer and his girlfriend, who works for an international aid organization, are taking a leisurely stroll through the Taliban-controlled mountains in Afghanistan, talking about their love when a rocket to a truck in front of them. They leave the vehicle to see the Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, revolvers and grenades to execute the five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) begins to take pictures of all this when he is caught by one of the insurgents who throws a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend. since they are throwing distance, can not be more than 50 meters away, but it somehow moves away. His girlfriend is exploded and he takes a photo of the moment of the impact of the grenade that kills her and wins a prize as a photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this movie is as ridiculous as the opening. The following year, Bob is on a mission to National Geographic on a Dutch island, where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and joins his unhappy underworld of international drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I would give it a 4.0 out of 10.
