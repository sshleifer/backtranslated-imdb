Originally screened as an ABC movie of the week. This involves two innocent university girls who are transported to a prison camp in a small southern town. They are not allowed to make calls and no one knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation, leading to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The TV version was (for the time) gloomy. No nudity and beatings were very tame, but the general sense of carelessness was wearing one of them. The unrated version is even worse - there is abundant nudity, extreme violence and, in a particularly disgusting sequence, we see a prisoner crying forced to undress while a lesbian guard "uses" her. DISGUSTING! There is nothing wrong with exploring movies, but this has just been overcome. You get the feeling that filmmakers like to have these poor women being tortured and degraded - all this is pushed into your face as if you would like it. The unnecessarily pessimistic end does not help. <br /> <br /> I'm giving a 3 because the acting is good - but it really makes the movie harder to watch. A sick and despicable movie. Not recommended.
