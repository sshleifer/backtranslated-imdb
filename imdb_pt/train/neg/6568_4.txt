It is curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who entered the new medium of television and became even greater successes and that both went towards the end of the production and enjoyed the status of tycoon in the small screen. Lucille Ball, however, was not a big star, who would come with the television. As for Dick Powell, he desperately wanted to stop making films like Meet The People and his career salvation would come in his next movie. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell made the film was because a young MGM player was cast in a special number and he was seeing it at the time. His private time with June Allyson was much better than what we see on screen. Powell seems completely bored and can not evoke any kind of emotion. <br /> <br /> He was probably tired of making these musicals with silly plots, the kind he fled from Warner Brothers. The original Meet The People show was not a book show, it was a magazine and ran in the 1940-1941 Broadway season for 160 performances. When MGM bought it, they discarded everything but the title and the title song. The rest of the score has been patched by several composers, and none of the songs is memorable. It is strange when you consider that part of the source material is from Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart. These guys must have emptied the trunk for stuff. <br /> <br /> The plot is more foolish than most of the pieces of musical propaganda of the time. Powell is the writer of a magazine called Meet The People and he is a yard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, he is interested, both are interested in the magazine, but the creative differences keep them apart until the end. This is the movie in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> MGM gave Powell and Ball some good musical acts that are the main reason to attend Meet The People. The great bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and the highlight of the movie for me is Bert Lahr, dressed in a commodore suit as Lou Costello had following dreams in In The Navy. The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg, who wrote to Lahr, the Courage number of the Wizard of Oz. And as almost everyone in the world has seen this movie, you have an idea of ​​how Heave Ho is. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell's next film was Murder My Sweet, in which he finally said goodbye to musicals. And Lucy would have to wait for the television before the world could see what she could actually do.
