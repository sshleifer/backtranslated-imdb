Everything in this movie is bad, the story, the acting, the effects, but it's funny, funny, funny! Scott Valentine in the army uniform that is ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt of a frown on his face as the leader of a group of special operations is hilarious! The '' terrorists '' are as scary and realistic as the '' kidnappers '', this is so false and bad at everything you try to laugh at. The part where the giant T-REX that somehow escaped aboard a ship and then somehow underneath is blown and you see the metal pole pointing where your head was, is the perfect end. If you're into bad movies, this is the pot of gold, the mona Lisa from bb-bad !!!
