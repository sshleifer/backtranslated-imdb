with all the European studios involved in this, you would think that you would have at least a beautiful photograph; but the local color is reduced to a minimum. <br /> <br /> The # 1 irritation is Mira Sorvino wearing a Russian accent to play a Spanish police officer - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. There is a supposed romantic story that is intentionally confusing - is she or is she not a lesbian? - for no purpose at all. The cops in the movie are the stupidest to have a serial killer movie for a long time. There seems to be some message about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s, but since virtually everyone involved in it is dead, the point is missed. <br /> <br /> Despite the narrative part of the bullfighting scenario (which part of the world can you tell), you do not even get a good look at a bullfight. Earnest Hemingway would have punched the director's nose - with my blessings.
