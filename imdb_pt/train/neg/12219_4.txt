This was a weird movie. It started very well. A solid soundtrack behind flash images of blood and chaos as our psychopath did his thing. <br /> <br /> Next comes your "fall" Here I could say that I was in a movie "B" for real. Poor acting, I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys could not. After the scene of our psychopath's death, we got the opening credit and the movie starts ... <br /> <br /> From this point on, it's bad to make big boobs, occasional buckets of blood, and badly made death scenes . That said, I gave the movie a four because, despite its flaws, it kept a kind of creepy that I could not get rid of. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this. movie, but I have to admit that I look worse.
