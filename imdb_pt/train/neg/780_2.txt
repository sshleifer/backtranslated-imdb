This show is awful. How is George wanting to kill his funny mother? This show is terrible. Parents are obviously horrible and children should be taken to child services. The daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete bitch. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his loud and unpleasant voice of Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I laughed at him a few times, but mostly at how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a horrible and despicable character. Of course, her husband has left her, but how can anyone laugh at the way she treated George when baby is beyond me. Can anyone explain to me how big George's head is funny? It's not that big! I have changed characters because they are too terrible and it would take hours for me to write and I frankly do not care enough. I care enough to tell someone looking at this and asking me whether or not they want to watch this program, that this program is a lousy excuse for a sitcom, and not worth their time. <br /> <br /> I give 2 starts, because the wife is extremely attractive.
