My guess is that this director / writer had something to say. Let's see, what could have been ... Toad storms would be scary? B. Can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say the word "C" many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? W. Throw my wife and make her say the word "F" every 2 seconds. That aside I really enjoyed the beginning and the frog storm. The rest was a relentless, overly long (underdone) and excessive failure. How good that many of you liked! <br /> <br />
