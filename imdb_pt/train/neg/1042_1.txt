First of all, write the script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? After all, we're not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> So, get amateur actors. It will be good for the hype of the festival. After all, who needs people who have spent years honing their craft? So hire a director of photography who does not know how to light up. You see, if it is well lit, it will not look "real" and the festival people will not like it. Who needs to have professional level photography? Then hire a ten year old who never has a camera to be their operator. It will give your movie a completely amateur touch that festival viewers will confuse with "reality" and ensure that even if you empty the seats of real, critical people and a small crowd that intellectualizes too much will scream "genius" because they will not believe it this was just a full amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Once you have done this, buy your ticket to the Bad Movies Festival, also known as Sundance. <br /> <br /> What a sad waste.
