The only redeeming quality of this film is the actual plot ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the design of the scene was tacky and very tacky. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to watch because of all the horrible acting. I would not recommend watching this ... The only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were a little attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the star of the novel. Some of the issues were well done, but there are continuity bugs all over the place ... I'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we make a good one soon?
