I love B movies ... but come on .... that was not even worth a note ... The end was dumb ... b / c IT WAS NOT REAL !!! ... not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... I mean, no lightning storm or crazy demonic powers? Slow as hell and then they just start killing the characters one by one in a period of 15 minutes ... and I'm not even going to start from the part of killing the guy without the head ... and then you can not even see what Jigsaw does with its so-called "new puzzle" .... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Id watch dry paint before Id recommend this movie abandoned by God to anyone else ... ah, and to make the other totem of the movie even better, you can see the guy playing the only creature in the basement scene through the window ... which was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that film waste
