What a stinkeroo this turned out to be !!! At the same time, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no big fights like Actress, but very beautiful and nice (particularly in films like "The Mark of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand"), but when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of its golden days disappeared quickly. The story is unbelievable and ridiculous, the second-class performance, the cast of unbearable support. I can not think of a more immature performance from anyone when compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most annoying leader they could have chosen. Added to that was the awful picture (and I'm not just referring to the color!) Everyone associated with it, must have shivered whenever it was shown.
