Let's just say I had to suspend less of my disbelief for Spider-Man than for Hooligans. That is, I have less trouble believing that Toby McGuire can stick to the buildings than Elija Wood knocking down the tough guys in Manchester. I'm not going to go into the details, since I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​grown-up, professional British men coming up with near-death scraps every weekend is, well ... funny. And this movie is not. The fight, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken very seriously. The seriousness of pugilism, the reverence with which the subject is treated becomes irritating, since it does not establish or resolve the conflict. It seems that the plot, with holes large enough to guide a Guinness truck, was slapped with an invented theme of "fish out of the water" so that viewers could look into Woods' tousled eyes as he learns how to become a man . . Hit other young football foe with blunt objects and then get away as fast as you can. The characters are caricatured, especially Americans at Harvard. The character's development and plot are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the image. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its peak until near the end, which you have spent almost two hours of your life and will never return. Take "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this tacky and disappointing failure. Do not waste time on the empty melodrama, the tired old "Yankee at the court of King Aururio," or the parables of the Elderly. They are just pure, dark and intelligent fun; the way violence should be.
