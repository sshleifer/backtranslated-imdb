Do not worry about trying to watch this terrible miniseries. It's a six-hour bore, an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no heat in this story, no real passion, no real romance. It's a dry, boring, prolonged and uninspired as they come. And it does not even reach the expected level of technical proficiency. Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more valuable.
