First directed by D.W. Griffith; presents a gloriously happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the Palace Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers the lovers, he decides to stage a terrible revenge of the type Edgar Allen Poe. It is hard to believe that lovers can not hear those who plot against them; although the actors are alternately trying to be loud (lovers) and quiet (cement mixers). The sets make "The Sealed Room" look very staged. The performances are good and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The Sealed Room (09/09/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
