This movie is lame and not funny. The plot does not even make sense. Some scientist who works in the fringes of science opens a door to another dimension (maybe hell ???) and his daughter is sucked through him or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and uses a (I think the demons in the other dimension did it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but she's gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they come across with this witch book of spells (they want to be witches or something ???) and the evil spell ends up being read again, which is how the evil demon comes to earth that only the girl in bikini and the guy rejected in love can stop Apparently. There are topless scenes without a reason and a guy my boyfriend says is a well-known wrestler, but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they've invented something to put it on because maybe wrestling fans actually watch this senseless movie. I'm sure topless girls do not hurt either. The DVD's extra features were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought this might help explain what was going on, but it actually just made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically, this is a movie go to camp to do-and-then-fight-a-monster, but there are a lot of things (like the other dimension and the seller of books) than to make it confusing. I did not like the movie, but it was only five dollars so big. I do not recommend watching it despite being very stupid, I can not think of any part of the movie that is good.
