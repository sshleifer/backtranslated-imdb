"Masters of Horror" proved to be a poor arena for "message episodes," and while a definite case can be made for Joe Dante's "Screwfly Solution" (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most efforts to do I've seen it as heavy and unimpressive (nothing disables horror more than a box of soap). And 'Pro-Life' simply focuses on reactionary views with ultra-violence; The young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), seen running through the forest, is almost hit by two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who happen to be driving to the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a sacred roller of cold stone and extreme right who will do anything to prevent his daughter from having an abortion. If for no other reason, Pro-Life gained some agitation for its controversial issue, but John Carpenter treats this whole undertaking with surprising indifference - he seems even less interested in making a film than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); the slow pace does not create tension, and simply brings the already weird plot to a trail. Even when Dwayne and his kids attack the clinic, with their weapons on fire, it's a stunning non-event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a "male miscarriage", the scene is considered unnecessary and gratuitous - an effort to fill in the signed movie. The bad performances (Perlman is sadly wasted here) become a consequence of the script, and Carpenter's direction seems exhausted, as if "Pro-Life" were the source of their next hot meal. By the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster costume are prowling the aisles, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were thinking ...
