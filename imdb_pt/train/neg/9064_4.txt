In fact, the off-Broadway adaptation of Marc Blitzstein's "Threepenny," was not as "discarded" as is generally believed. <br /> <br /> (I have a special interest in "Threepenny", my father was part of the first full production in the US, U of Illlinois Theater Guild made around the end of World War II.HJitler had been so successful in suppressing the game that they had to reconstruct the script and score of recordings in two different languages ​​{nor English}, a script of German prompter and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not a "translation" - it had the complete approval of Lotte Lenya - was much closer to the original than is generally believed. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the version most people know is the MGM recording (recently available on Polygram on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur as Lucy, the "great big girl", and me I can not see his hands on his hips and shoulders?) thrown back on that line - Bea was a big baby in the 1950s, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was heavily censored by Mike Curb, head of MGM Records - I mean, 17 I think it was) "Goddamn" was cut only for "curse". <br /> <br /> (At the same time, MGM also offered a set of 2 LPs from the entire * piece, arguably as heavily censored.
