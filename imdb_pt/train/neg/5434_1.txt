Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few complaints. - The writer eliminated two main characters from the book. The plot was grotesquely changed. - Narratives sound as if they are directly taken from written passages (which can read well, but are not the same as spoken, especially with Chabon's writing style). - The acting is more of wood than a wooden hut. (Esp Bechstein) - Should this be defined in 1983 ??? It seems more like 2003 ... To be fair I could not finish watching this movie, so it is possible that he has redeemed himself ... (sarcasm). I really hope no one pays to see this, or at least anyone who reads the book expecting something decent (the Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but he should be confused by this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No star.
