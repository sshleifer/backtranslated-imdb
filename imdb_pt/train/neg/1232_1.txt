Says a girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this "movie." No wonder she has no other credits in her name to write or direct. She made a serious vocational error in choosing this as her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The fundamentally wrong thing with this film, besides its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs, is the flagrant and complete lack of LOGIC. . <br /> <br /> After she leaves the mall, she is approached by four thugs as they surround her. Tell me, what woman would aggressively make a potential attacker while surrounded and verbally insult them? I do not mean after an attack has started, because of course it is completely normal for someone to fight. But she pushed that guy and practically climbed to the next level. No woman would do this unless she 1) had a gun, 2) had the confidence to know that the backup is very close and therefore is relatively safe, or 3) the attackers are so young and weak that she is sure she can take them. None of this applied to this situation, so she was just acting like someone who is asking to be raped or robbed. And by the way, when the security guard approached, as soon as he reached a distance of observation from Kim Basinger, why would not she rush toward him for help or shouting? <br /> <br /> When she leaves after the security officer is shot in the head, she heads for a deserted part of town and falls down. She had a good three-minute advantage over the pursuers, instead of simply running in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing, she picks up her red toolbox and begins to tug under the hood. I understand she was trying to fix her car, but she should have run. <br /> <br /> (I did not even mean it to be a chronological summary of the film because I hate people who do this in their comments, but it turns out that every major sequel to that movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have who would comment on it. <br /> <br /> Why would she carry a red toolbox like she is? trying to escape in the dark? <br /> <br /> When she gets caught, one of the clowns demands that she open the toolbox. This scene here is so rich in subtle reflections of the complete failure of the dramatic effect I have to break it down, it's one of the most idiotic scenes in the entire movie.When asked to open the box, she is resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the criminals to open her in anger after she did not open it, just as someone in some action movie might have some device that one enemy requires that the person touch / push / open / manipulate, and once the hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, only for that device to automatically dispense a chemical / shoot the unconscious face / render, which was the plane of the hero all the time. It seems like this is what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, when she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes a KEY and dispatches one of the bad guys, and somehow walks away from him and the other three bad guys. <br /> <Throughout the rest of the movie, basically what you see is this woman from the suburban home, sneaking through the forest as she loads her Red Toolbox, taking away various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKS. <br /> <** When she was fleeing, how did she eventually move back to where the bad guys were? I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in honor of the dead guy. She somehow approached them when I thought she was moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, this whole premise is so weak because the reason why she is being pursued in the first place is because the thugs In perspective, she was a witness to a murder they committed against the officer earlier, and then they felt they had to kill her. That's ridiculous. As one of the bandits went so far as to say, they might have just left the city and returned to the city from which they came, no one besides them saw them anyway, and she probably could not get the license plate. Even if those possibilities do not work in your favor, how is it to raise hell and hunt someone to kill them, increasing your chances of escaping with the original murder?
