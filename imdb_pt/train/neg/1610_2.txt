What I found so curious about this movie - I saw the full version of the roadshow 4 hours, is how strangely dispassionate it is. For a film about two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, engaged in a gigantic political struggle, are almost totally devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who at best is a second level actor with a slightly high voice) have no drama or depth and basically arrive at Castro telling Che: go here, go there, do it and that without any explanation about the effect or use of this action will result in. Stranger still is that there is an actor in the cast who has the power needed to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but he is diverted in a small part of the second half. Without the tension or passion you'd expect to fire these men and their followers, the film becomes an epic and time-consuming film about bearded and hairy men running through various jungles screaming and shooting for no particular purpose or end. Several of the reviews I read praised the work of director Steven Soderbergh, almost completely ignoring the actors. (In fact, I've spent more time talking about Soderbergh's new digital film camera than the storyline or actors or the fact that it's all in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is a strange and strange thing because a) Soderbergh was just a gunslinger. in the film and b) is no more than a competent job, with a nod to Oliver Stone's JFK on the black-and-white camera cut when Che visits New York. If you can imagine the Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you will have an idea of ​​the incompetent competence of this film.
