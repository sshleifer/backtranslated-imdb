I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins to be dull and boring. All the action scenes were stupid. The so-called "GRABOIDS" are reduced to the size of a modern, if not minor, house cat. The acting was horrible, and this one film was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor saga, because even if they tell the story of how the graboids were formed, the story is so idiotic and useless. Also, if you want to tell a story back in time, make sure you use the SAME ACTOR (Michael Gross), to be someone in the past, when he is someone present in the other Tremor movies.Geez ... If you have not seen this movie yet, do not waste your time. for Tremors, 1, 2 and 3, for a long time. This movie, however, make sure that you're remote is sitting by your side with the STOP button running for a quick retreat away from this nonsense.
