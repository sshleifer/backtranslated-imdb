Not that I was really surprised ... the movies are never as good as the books they came from. I was anxious to see this movie because this is one of my favorite books, even though it would probably suck. I was expecting to be pleasantly surprised. However, they strayed too far from the plot of the book, and the film version did not convey how awful this house really was. The ending was also different. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to a very bad plastic surgery. The acting was not worthy of note at best. Maybe if a theatrical version was made so they did not have to stay so much in Lifetime's "made for TV" box, it would be a better movie. If you've seen this movie, I encourage you to crawl the book and read it. I doubt you'll be disappointed and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it.
