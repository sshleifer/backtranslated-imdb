Okay, I watched this movie twice now, I searched heavily on the net, I asked several people there reviews. I got to read the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic "Carmilla", a book on which this movie should be based. I feel the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play while watching it. As the plot of the film does not seem to make any sense, here is the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her father, Mr. De Lafontaine. They continue their lives happily and peacefully. One day they receive a letter from the 'General', a man who made it his mission in life to avenge his daughter's death. He states that supernatural powers are at work and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman causes the Lafontaines to care for their daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura begins to be dominated by strange dreams and begins to suffer a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what does she have to do with Laura and the General? <br /> <br /> I invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play, and let me know what your results are. I even have a cute name, and I would have a jingle too, but I can not be bothered about it. It's called "this movie does not make any sense" game. <br /> <br /> All you have to do is, while watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot that explains what's going on. I mean complete, all the questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> You'll have to answer questions like ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk around in the day? light? <br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why a girl named Bob? And why does she kill herself? <br /> <br /> * When is the movie a dream and when is it real? <br /> <br /> * Why does killing zombies seem like an accepted part of life? Does not anyone blink? Why Travis Fontaine stains and runs over a zombie without slowing down while driving his car, but when confronted with a woman with an obvious hostage on the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too? <br /> <br /> And why does he then leave a girl, who he later openly reveals that he knows to be the vampire's head, driving with him in his car? <br /> <br /> * And then let her leave alone with her daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What the hell is the asylum scene? <br /> <br /> * What the hell is green goo? <br /> <br /> * Why does the vampire head suddenly start dressing like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why are there never vampires struggling? Zombies <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the necklace? what is it made of? Why does this kill vampires? And how does Jenna know that? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so much fun trying to ask so many questions about this movie as well. <br /> <br /> I have my plot, and I have to admit that it's not exactly there, but it's a good effort. <br /> <br /> In Conclusion <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs. Zombies' does not have time when there actually are vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, but they seem very reluctant to let the audience talk about it. And it's somehow based on a classic nineteenth-century horror novel. As? Because? What the hell is happening?
