Since this image is classified as a work of "pure entertainment" and since there are already many comments on the subject, I would like to address something relevant to the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the wild card in this movie. Certainly, since he has been involved in casting, he has always acted like a little man - an actor can change his usual costume, but he can hardly change his physical appearance - and the latter can be an advantage when necessary. However, far from what I expected, I saw a very disguised image, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby's life by mistake of a 40-year-old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. So what's the point? Many elements are mixed, some of the main ones being violence, sex and criminal activities, among which the story is poorly composed and to some extent a lack of common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and the life of the husband being pursued? In addition, the diamond is even bigger than the world number 1 Cullinan! But the most disgusting facet is the continual attempt to invent the little man as superman, showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it can not be cut by any other material, but can only be conquered by the warm blood of a male goat. So it is not a diamond anymore, but pieces of debris.
