CQ is incredibly slow and I am a fan of David Mamet. The film follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very Barbarella-like film. After that the movie started to lose me. Deep and deep? Not really. The movie "Dragonfly" being made in CQ has the problem of having no end. This is very similar to CQ, which also does not have an end (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky to see this movie at the SxSW film festival. I had pretty high expectations having watched Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies. I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it was not an easy movie to get into. If you do not like science fiction movies or slow 60s movies that go nowhere, skip it. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student movie. If you want a recent science fiction indie movie to rent Donnie Darko, it will not put you to sleep.
