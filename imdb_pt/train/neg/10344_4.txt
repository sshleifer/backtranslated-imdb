I saw this movie ran in the early hours in TCM. Several problems with the film became apparent from what I saw. First, adults did not age when children did for 10 years. Several parts of the film have had continuity problems, and for some reason the actor who played the younger son seemed the oldest when the ten years went by. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared. It's a pity, because even if the script left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell did well in the film in their roles. It's a shame the big piece is missing, but what's here is watchable. <br /> <br /> I just wanted everything to be intact. Does the script make little sense in that Bergman's character is dismissed when the children are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the timelines also make no sense. There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929, but children grow up to fight in World War 1. All the support staff's performance in this movie is fine. I just wonder what was in the 20 films gap that I could not see how it was missing.
