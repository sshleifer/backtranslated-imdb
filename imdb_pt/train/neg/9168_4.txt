Randolph Scott is leaving the US for the greener pastures of British Columbia, Canada. He wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They wreck their little flock on a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory. Later, Jory whispers his cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the tumult. <br /> <br /> From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of adult themed westerns, some of them considered true classics. Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among your best Westerners. <br /> <br /> It's more like the stuff Roy Rogers or Gene Autry can use. The story is completely silly at times. Williams, who went along for the ride with Scott, he wanted to go gold prospective because there was a big strike at the time. He does not blame the thieves, he blames Scott for persuading him to make the journey for the loss of his arm. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the movie where Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes are captured by the Indians. They escape because Gabby's mule was taught to kick the command and he kicks the Indians away, allowing our heroes to escape. I'm not sure if I would have played in a Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story really wants you to believe that tyros explorer Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after only a few lessons from gold prospector Gabby Hayes about finding gold. <br /> <br /> This was the farewell part of Gabby Hayes. It would have been better if he had gone out on a good western and, indeed, had done some better with Randolph Scott before that. <br /> <br /> I'll say this, though no caribou has appeared the movie, this is one of the few Canadian locality films of the past that have had no Mounties. <br /> <br /> But if I were you, unless you're a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, make the next detour on the Cariboo trail.
