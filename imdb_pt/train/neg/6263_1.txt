"Nightmare Weekend," by Henry Sala, is a piece of rotten mud from Troma. It's a juvenile, sloppy and stupid low-budget horror movie about some teens who spend the weekend in a mansion. The professor's evil assistant draws the girls into a bizarre scheme. to perform hideous experiments. Using a brain implant, she transforms her victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a completely intricate piece of junk that features a lot of nudity and something boring, not to mention a laughable soundtrack. it's horrible and the script is completely incoherent. Why this piece of crap is widely distributed is beyond me. Avoid this like the plague.
