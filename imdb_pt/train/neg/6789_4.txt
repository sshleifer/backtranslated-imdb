The plot of this film hangs on an important point: that this killer was also a responsible, loving and considerate parent. Not that being a father and murderer is impossible. But this man is shown murdering a teenager without provocation or reason and without emotion. This girl was someone's daughter. I do not think a father who cares so much about his own daughter could be so cold to someone else's daughter. Or, alternatively, it could have been so cold-blooded and still worrying and caring for her own daughter. And the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask the victim's parents to look after their daughter is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> That said, the characters were convinced by the actors. I thought changing the color of Scott Bakula's eyes made him seem colder and menacing than he normally is. You could not see it in your eyes at all.
