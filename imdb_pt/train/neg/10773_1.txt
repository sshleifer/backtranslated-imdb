I watched this horrible thing on TV. Needless to say, it's one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get. Frankly, I do not know how much lower the bar can go. <br /> <br /> The characters are made up of one type of lame stereo after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say MUCH less. <br /> <br /> I've seen some award-winning turkeys in my time, but there's no reason to list any of them since this is "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me put it to you that way, I watched the movie Vanilla Ice because it was so bad it was funny. This ... this ... is not that good.
