Music that fits the nerves like nails on a blackboard, acting so mocking was a shame to squander the cast for not doing a second film; casting them all as real zombies - with the cast of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, as the heroes ... such an absolutely horrible movie that if the "junkies" were still around, it could be considered a cult movie - but oh so amateurish, the scripts could have been loaded by the actors, their lines read as they crawled slowly through the film-banal, illogical, modeling kits from Los Angeles subdivisions, directly from ToysRus! Was it an already made movie that is so completely and totally inept? Logic flies to the wind in this maze, meaningless, meaningless and with a "monster" so stupid and uncoordinated that it could not get a tortoise in a refrigerator - lowcut, leggy - and amazon! This kept my attention all the time; the way a terrible, continuous accident in the haze involving several vehicles keeps one observing to the end ... how, after a ridiculous lightning-armed struggle in a prison on another planet, a sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter with pneumatic disadvantages chases a retarded extraterrestrial fugitive --- FOR THE EARTH! Do not let anyone p ** s in your popcorn, you may really enjoy watching this. It's so bad!
