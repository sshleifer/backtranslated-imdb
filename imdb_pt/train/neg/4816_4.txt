I imagine the young people involved in creating "Necromancy" (aka "The Witching" and a lot of other titles) must have felt a little strange being on the set of a horror movie with the man who: Houseman in the production of a proletarian play ("The Cradle Will Rock"); scared people into thinking that aliens were invading ("The War of the Worlds"); and directed and starred in the all-time greatest film ("Citizen Kane"). And now Orson Welles was starring in a third-rate film about a satanic cult. <br /> <br /> There is nothing creative about this movie. Lots of nudity, but background music is always a distraction. Even though the film was not particularly predictable, it was still not worth seeing. How low Welles had sunk. Fortunately, in the last thirteen years of his life, he has chronicled the documentary "Bugs Bunny Superstar" (about Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s) and presented the documentary "The Man Who Seen Tomorrow" (Nostradamus). I recommend these two, but not this one. Just avoid it. <br /> <br /> Also starring Pamela Franklin and Michael Ontkean.
