Okay, guys, honestly ... this has to be one of the worst show business movies ever made, but I've been laughing at myself (maybe that's why I like it). Basically, it's all about sex, sex and a way to get your own 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was a major issue in this movie? If you like bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and you do not have something better to do). <br /> <br /> Spoilers of attention !!! *** The funniest thing in the movie was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) On the show and show his wallet with his love. The pictures. A triple A for bad taste and fun!
