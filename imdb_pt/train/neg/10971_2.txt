How Irish critics praise this film is beyond me. Exaggerated by the usual band of Irish actors drawn to all Irish films. Terrible script, with peculiarities of forced character (the brown sauce). Romanticising everything that is bad about Dublin. The attitude of "oh, it's rubbish, but it sure is not great anyway." Plenty of tidbits purely for the American public (the grocery boss and his horribly forced slogan). And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney's character. A great actor forced to interpret that part that could have been written by a five year old. Things worth noting. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and it's bad when you have to say it. Well, at least he was not putting it in his terrible American accent. International Audiences Be Forewarned: Stay home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better time. Intermission is an external walk
