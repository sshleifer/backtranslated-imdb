While this is not a "great movie", there is something compelling and memorable about it. As another commentator on the film, I saw this in my childhood. It's been thirty-three years since 1952, but I've never forgotten the story or its ridiculously heavy title. See if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves over the decades. More than any other film, it brings a human face to the historical drama of "progress" of the early twentieth century. It is engaging enough for a young spectator and memorable enough for an older one. Also, it's easy to like the characters and watch their passage in time.
