It's very bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the movie itself. The "story summary" of a long paragraph written on the movie page contains details that I could not understand while watching the movie itself. I found myself constantly backing up to see the details that I had just missed, which could tell me what the (beep) was going on. Unfortunately, this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of history, if you could call it history. It's as if they're trying to fool us into thinking there was some kind of movie here, filming just enough that there was a resemblance to a story and leaving the rest to our imagination. Newsflash for the creators: I paid to watch you make a movie. I can stay at home and imagine stories and stories for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I've never paid enough attention to be able to put the name on the face, and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I've ever seen for a main character in any movie, A or B. I realized that yes, maybe she really did not want the part, I just got a good offer for a movie that she was not into ? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, do not reserve as a leader if you can not act. If you really can, then create a decent character for you to become. Also, someone here has mentioned the white / Latin issue - yes, I hate to say it, but this movie is an act of revenge against college-aged white men wearing baseball caps. This is what happens when there is nothing in the movie to please the observer to the Latino characters. The character Adrian looks like an arrogant jerk who is no better than the antagonist of the story. As for the Mayan character, she did not look like a real person. Anyway, I'm ashamed by Hollywood that this movie has been made.
