Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time I've tried a movie that literally had no meat or potatoes. The whole movie looked like it was just the salad without main course. The plot was fallible and laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, realism was out of the window and the animation was done by four-year-olds. Does that cover it? I've never been more ashamed of a concept in my whole life. I've never read comics or seen other shows with this character, but by the looks of other reviews I'm not far from my observation. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the story moved very quickly. For someone new to this character and situations, I needed more resources to create the reasons instead of finding the solution. I've seen another Anime (if you could call this Anime) that does great things with your characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing left for Lady Death. In some short scenes, we see her train with Cremator and instantly become that aggressive beast from Hell. It was hard for me to swallow, considering moments before she was presented as this weak and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly, she is immersed in hatred and can fight against an existence that already exists millions of years ago. That was absurd. Lady Death's performance was poor, to say the least. I felt like she was nothing more than an animated character rather than a desperate woman with revenge on her mind. For me, it just did not work. She was nothing more than a sneer for teenage boys who wanted to covet the mass of skin that suddenly grew in her chest when training with Cremator. I felt bad just looking at her. The same goes for the character Cremator. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I was babbling more incoherently than real development. It's a very sad day in hell when we give up the characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated film. <br /> <br /> Then there was Lucifer himself. Let me just say that I think I could fight the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was laughable and he just did not represent the image I had in mind. It was as if Disney were in control and wanted to make it semi-PC. He did not have the darkness and corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the ruler of hell, but only a footman who had a greater place to live. Speaking of living or dying, how can you die again in hell? This was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. Most of the characters were worried about dying when they did not even consider the option that they were already dead. This is how they got to hell. I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the movie for me. I could not grasp the notion that his soul was still in a solid body in Hell, but could this be just me? or maybe it was because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story. There was nothing built, just preparing. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were hysterically bad. The animation of this design seemed to have been made in the early 90's. There was nothing impressive about the way this movie was drawn. Why are we, America, so lagging behind in animation? It's huge in Asia, and it's crawling on hardcore here because we keep making movies like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of the imagination. We're cheap, and this movie shows that. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was bad. The animation along with the horrendous voice work was cheap. I had head somewhere that this movie like in production for a long time, which is difficult to understand because I think I could have made this movie on my credit card. The production was horrible as was the story. Nothing was developed, leaving huge holes that almost all fell. The strength of the characters was lacking, and nothing was explained. I wasted my time on this one and would like to alert others that when death comes you will not be in my condition and regretting that you have wasted 80 minutes with this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Grade: * out of *****
