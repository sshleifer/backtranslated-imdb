Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her dedicated son (Ron Silver) to locate the recluse Greta Garbo and present the two before Estelle checks out. It may have been titled "Bancroft Talks" as the actress attacks this comic / dramatic / sentimental material uncertain by its duration. Hot-or-Cold director Sidney Lumet can not maintain a consistent pace, and Bancroft's constant overcoming is not minimized by the filmmaker - he keeps it straight: beautiful, with tears in his eyes and complaints. Estelle becomes an obstacle in this scenario (not that the ill-conceived plot has much going on beyond that). Silver and co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do besides supporting the star, and everyone is trampled by their hamming. * 1/2 of ****
