The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters joining as mothers of doomed killers. With horrible notoriety after the trial, the two women join and leave NY to California to open a music and dance studio for Shirley Temple-style girls. <br /> <br /> From the outset, it becomes apparent that Reynolds made a mistake by taking Winters with her to California. Winters plays a deeply religious woman who, more and more, seems to be relaxing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, women living together are receiving threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who wears a blonde wig, is soon turned into a novelist by the rich dad of one of her students, very well played by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of her last films, is briefly seen as Sister Alma, who Winters is a faithful listener. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. She is heavy here and the weight seemed to make her act even better. Winters always did well on papers that tested his nerves. <br /> <br /> The end is of the macabre and who can forget Winters to the piano beating with that totally insane appearance?
