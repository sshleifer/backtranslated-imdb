The premise of the film is that the son of Thomas Archer was murdered and his wife was brutalized - and he is given a chance for revenge when (after post-traumatic therapy) he is placed in a room with a man tied to a chair and said that this was the culprit. He is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution: drills, bats, nails, mallets, torches, anything you might think anyone might want to use to physically hurt another human being. <br /> <br /> We go through many scenes of torture before we find out that The Man Archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime. The two then create an uncomfortable alliance; who put them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when all is said and done, we do not care ...
