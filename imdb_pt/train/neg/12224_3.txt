Barbara Streisand heads and stars in this very Jewish story. To get a chance to get an education, Babs disguises himself enthusiastically as a boy that is not the hardest thing to do, since she already looks like a boy, anyway. In her new school she meets many classmates who have no problem believing that she is a guy. <br /> <br /> Do not miss out on the best of many moments of unintentional humor when the male friend of Babs thinks she is a man but holds him to the ground, sits on top of him and looks affectionately at the "your" eyes ... * giggle *. <br /> <br /> Mediocre film; witty story about nothing particularly interesting.
