One could probably make a great documentary on the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictionalized version just manages to drain anything authentic and interesting from the TV phenomenon in the trash. There are dozens of notoriously bad films (eg "Hands: The Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this dismal waste of films. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not a documentary about Jerry? Springer Show, which would begin to answer some of the real issues like: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear in this show? How did the mayor of Cincinatti meet here? <br /> <br /> A good sentence: During an "orientation" session for guests: "People, I can not emphasize this enough: NO GUNS!"
