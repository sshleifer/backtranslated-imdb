What makes the "executive producer" in a movie. If I remember correctly, it is the person who raised the financial support to make the film. You may notice in a large number of movies starring Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer, which means that Connery himself raised the money since he is a great player. Unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a large number of films "starring Sean Connery were made exclusively because he managed to raise money since he is a major Hollywood player, it is usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story / script not being able to scratch <br /> <br /> PROTOCOL follows the saga of a Sunny Davis a waitress a kooky bimboqueque cocktail that spares a visiting dignitary and as a reward becomes a top diplomat.Provide? As things progress, Mrs. Davis (who has trouble joining two sentences) finds herself in more bizarre and less likely situations, when I say that PROTOCOL is Goldie.Hawn, who is also the executive producer of the movie, do you understand what I'm saying about the story / script is not easy?
