Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, particularly the nature of addiction, which still resonate strongly today. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... huh. Nothing special. The videographer clearly had an unfortunate habit of circling and circling around everything, leaving the spectator sick. Why the director did not put an end to it is beyond me - but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to get good performances from these usually excellent, but inappropriately scaled actors. All in all, a weak adaptation. His three hours would be better spent reading (or rereading) the book.
