Please humor me if you want, for a minute while I read you the back of the ALLEY CAT VHS box. He says that: <br /> <br /> In this part of town, every street is a dead end - at every corner, something to buy - in any alley, another way to die - To survive, you have to be the better - just like the alley cat. Alley Cat- This lady owns the night. In the streets where even predators become victims, she knows how to survive. Cross it and you're out of luck. Alley Cat- This animal is excited. <br /> <br /> Is not this one of the most pathetic sentences you've ever heard in your life? Whoever wrote this must be crazy if they thought such a horrible description could lead us to see the video. Still, unfortunately, any faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of English, doing his job very well ... the film contained in the little plastic case is as bad as it looks, and then some. <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays the title role, and the script basically tells her throughout the scene to: a) Pouting like a goldfish b) Kicking the male butt or c) Showing her "attributes" feminine There are no complaints about the latter but in terms of the other two .. let's say she's not much of an actress, and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert. But even Meryl Streep with the body of Cynthia Rothrock (what a creepy thought) could not save this movie. The unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief, since we have an inept fight sequence directed after enough, stopping only for hysterical court pranks and the occasional love scene that induces provocation with the curiously named Robert Torti. The work of the camera also follows a similar path of shame, with too many unnecessary close-ups and plentiful continuity errors. <br /> <br /> The part that I think really sums up this trash can from a movie is where our heroine is sexually assaulted, and finds herself witnessing before a corrupt judge while her rich kid rapist looks at her from the box. Not only does he go unpunished, despite the overwhelming evidence against him, but she herself is then arrested for daring to protest against the verdict in front of her honor. Behind bars, she then takes a group bath, a lesbian passion, a couple of cat fights and a good, sweaty volleyball match before being released on bail to continue her battle. This ten minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the screenplay ends with that. I can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more T & A to the mix, and came up with this unnecessary sub-plot as a means to achieving that end. <br /> <br /> What kind of question is the question, is this an exploration film or a serious drama? Not even my answer to that ... is not scruffy or camping enough to lure Troma-style moviegoers, and it certainly does not play the role of exploiting a woman's struggle against the system ... simply because it is so frighteningly done. So who on earth would want to see this? Lunatics, I think ... or IMDb reviewers who stay up until 3:00 p.m. and watch any old junk in the box while they try to sleep. Unfortunately, occasionally, I failed, and the horrors will stay with me for some time. Do not make the same mistake I did. Have a hot milk or something .. 1/10
