First, I have no idea how this movie hit the big screen. It's not even the low-budget SCI-Fi channel movie, it's just awful. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, SdA, etc. we went to see this movie waiting for this movie for me a Transformers with dragons, irrational entertainment. All we got was an irrational hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I'd expected, but the plot is so bad along with acting that it made up for it. It's basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years ... Looks like a good remake of Fire Rain? No, the plot tries to be deeper than it should, leaving not just holes in the plot, but with magic, and a very small real war between dragons (fairly large snakes), this just makes a fool of itself. The director tried to add a bit of humor to the movie that failed. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing (along with all 5 of the audience), and we can not believe we spent money on it. The short trailer on the TV compensates for most of the action, while the crap does the rest. I've seen many B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider and others, but I have to say that if you want a non-stop laugh for an hour, check this out. <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but I would have helped before I saw this movie
