In The Lost Son, a private detective in search of a missing man finds a ring of child prostitution. This movie incorporates all the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst-case scenario that exists only in the minds of Hollywood, the press and AG John Asscrap. If you get the chance to see it, you'd better get lost.
