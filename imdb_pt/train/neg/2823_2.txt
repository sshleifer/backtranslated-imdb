Well, TiVo recorded it because of Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It looked promising. It was very fast. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of overcoming, even from Angelina. She is about 20 years old and is 16 years old. There are three characters that must be Italian. Everyone is Italian-American. The native Italian accents were good, I thought. The young male is cute, my wife says. Everyone in this movie is a fat Italian woman. Even the men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a rude doctor, that was a bad sign. The two couples who chase after their children are like the four Italian puppets. <br /> <br /> My wife did not let go of the remote. I hope she's not taking makeup, clothing or decorating tips. It was a sickly, distorted combination of horrible and gaudy. It was hidegarishous. <br /> <br /> Slashing my left ventricle was not enough to distract the pain from watching this movie. If this movie shows up on your TV, do yourself a favor and swipe your head over the TV screen. You'll be glad you did it. The only movie I've ever seen that was worse than that was "Hamburger: The Movie". Or perhaps "mortal friend."
