Absolutely terrible Mexican film supposedly based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe about a journalist wanting to enter the confines of an asylum hidden in the forest to write a story about how it works, etc ... When our hero, Gaston, is given the grand spectacle of the Dr. Maillard, head of the asylum, we see all kinds of things that are supposed to be horrible, like men walking for a long time in a dungeon and comic, like our hero being played by soldiers as he descends a ladder hanging next to a building . So there's a vision that could have been both: a human man dressed as a chicken, yes, that's right, a chicken that pecks around the chicken coop. The scene was supposed to be a comic highlight of the movie, but at least for me it was the low point of the movie and really more revolting when you thought grown men and women thought this could even be remote entertainment. Ah! This is really the true horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And that brings me to this salient fact about the film, which is most of the films that go through several title changes, usually have some kind of serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution issues and others, of which this is one, have numerous title changes so someone may unknowingly buy the same junk more than once. This is definitely rubbish. There is very little for this. The only artist worth a look is Claudio Brook as head of the asylum. He is a huge piece of ham while he laughs madly, sends out bellows, rolls with the sword in his hand and praises the chicken. I was so tired of hearing him talk about the "soothing system" as the means to heal the mentally ill. What a bunch of ludicidade (Hey, a movie like this with a script like this deserves that kind of word). It will not take long to find out what is happening in the asylum and it will not be more interesting. Scratch off cinematic chicken!
