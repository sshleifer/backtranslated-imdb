A lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in Leon, then other parts have felt like some other movie, I do not know which but there is a familiar feeling throughout the film. It was good to watch, but it would have been fantastic! if the story were more original. The theme of the little girl, Leon's bad killer, is just a little refined. The opening scenes are very good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen at the cinema :-) My biggest problem was to remember which parts were from Leon, Nikita and the French or American version. If you have not seen Leon yet, this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Regards / Rick
