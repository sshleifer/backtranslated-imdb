This is to be a comedy but mostly bad taste, and nothing remotely causing a smile in the movie. The movie is about a couple who are trying to raise a child, and those people in real life who are in this situation will cringe at the depictions depicted. For example, scenes in a fertility clinic are not at all funny and frankly embarrassing. The male leader who plays a construction worker and his helmet looks like an excuse to reject the Village People. The female leadership is trying to look 20 years younger than she is. Both clues are unpleasant, unattractive and completely unconvincing. There are several ridiculous, totally unpretentious free scenes in the movie, for example, with an economy airline that is devoid of any humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a mark for Shirley Maclaine, which is a class above anything else in the picture, and a mark for some decent (albeit old) music.
