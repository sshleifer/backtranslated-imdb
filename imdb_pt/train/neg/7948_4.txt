"The seventh sign" lends a lot of "Rosemary's baby" and "the omen" (it really combines the two stories). Even his title resembles Bergman's "seventh seal." <br /> <br /> However, it starts well enough, with all the omens scattered all over the land and, in parallel, an apparently distinct plot, with Moore's husband trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who were brother and sister) of the death penalty. time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to the rescue (even the wandering Jew is involved), which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny (have you ever been to Sunday school?) but they taught me that God was love !). IMHO scene, is the short dialogue between Father John Heard - who does not seem to take things seriously, pity that he has not been given a more important role because his relaxed acting is invaluable - and the young Jew. <br /> <Demi Moore probably registered the same desire as ex-husband Bruce Willis: save the world. She does not save the movie for all that.
