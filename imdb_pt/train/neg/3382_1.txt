This is one of the worst cinematic adaptations of a musical ever made. The stage version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This movie misses the mark in almost every way. Even the cast is disconcerting. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Val's song. Val's story is that she's a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department. Yes, she finds a solution, but after all she is a great dancer. What do brilliant filmmakers do? They hire an actress who does not know how to dance and is famous for looking great. Way to miss the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there is the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning up in the grave. Why did not they use their choreography? It really can not be improved.
