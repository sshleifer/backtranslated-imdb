I'm going to be short ... This movie is an embarrassment to everyone except your director of photography. The very fact of being a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are "treated" with a prolonged dance scene. The plot is ridiculous no one except the most ardent fan of BAD terror will get anything out of it. And for the love of God, please stop saying that this movie is a tale of lost innocence or even feminine empowerment, because it's clearly not (muddled and infantile lesbians, what the heck?). This was by far the worst film of the Edinburgh festival (which I saw anyway), someone even collapsed in the middle of the film, probably because they could not stand it any longer. this may seem like an overly critical speech, but I really can not find a redeeming feature of this movie except perhaps if you take it as pure comedy. In short, this movie is best watched in a Class A drug cocktail.
