If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's the unusual ability to tell a story and tell it over and over again and again. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disney will ruin one of its most incredible classics of all time. I even had that scene of spaghetti dumpling. It's been done before! And that's what I say for this sorry straight to the video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a replay of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad movies. The pair of penguins and walruses (I even forgot their names) is just a very poor copy of Timon and Pumba. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats virtually all of her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard such bad songs from them before so far. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they had time to make the animation a bit decent. All the usual characters are not as annoying as they used to be (or maybe that's a minus sign for Little Mermaid fans). Back to the negative, Melody is so disgustingly cute that you can vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and your little mermaid do yourself a favor. Do not waste your money on this. It is true that it is not as horrible as the return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that is little consolation.
