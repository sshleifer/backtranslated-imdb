In this forgettable pitfall, Norma Shearer, 40, plays a vibrant, youthful socialite in Monte Carlo, stuck in a dispute between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the failure of this film with the tedious and talented script, or with director George Cukor, who never seems interested in animating the film's widespread coma. Mostly, however, it is Shearer's own fault that she desperately wanted to keep playing "young" plays as long as she could get away with it. Inadvertently, this makes "Her Cardboard Lover" a bizarre monument to the vanity of a woman who is aging.
