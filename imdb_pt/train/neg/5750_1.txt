in fact, it was pretty funny ... in a "god, how the hell was this movie made?" if you make fun of movies ... what I kind of do ... go ahead and watch ... but if you're really thinking "is this a good movie?" And this movie was sucked out of the initial scene with the worst acting I've ever seen in any movie ... usually they get five minutes before you realize "this movie might suck." "... but no, you know right away .. this movie talks about edgar allen poe ... never tried to explain it, to people who have not memorized poe's life story ... so I do not know if any of it was said it is fact. <br /> <br /> This film is about an "ethan poe" writer relating to his cousin "ann" ... they are both descendants of edgar allan poe ... or are they?!? apparently Ethan poe is actually ethan "usher", who is supposed to be a descendant of the story "the house of usher" that was written by edgar allen poe. to try to rape her ... Ann is also being chased, at one point in the movie, by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... they're like behind her looking at her and she does not even notice). who are being murdered, appear at the end to try to save the day ... but they can not. in the end, ann shoots ethan while e She's trying to kill her best friend. Of course, before she shoots, she has to shout "Never again!" this movie should never be seen again!
