This film was so predictable, that all along you expect the obvious suspect to be innocent, and there is still some other great turnaround. However ... this does not happen. He just keeps acting so scary, and she continues to ignore him. Mary found very incriminating evidence in her home, and she still trusted him? And what was that "throwing the trap"? There was no trap. She confronted him, he said, "Excuse me. I have to kill someone." He left, and that was the end of it. They make attempts to use other suspects (like that older carnival girl in the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. In fact, all the characters are underdeveloped. They have no depth, and the scenery is just weird ... who leaves in a recycling factory? Its busy and nothing is well developed. For example: When she leaves the house after taking the beer, he finds the pictures and she runs and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car ... what was that? Their reactions were not portrayed. In the car, she acted with fear, as if it had been practically rape-but all we see is her bath the next morning. booooooooo could have been much better .. sooo much better.
