The acting was horrible and they got both sports wrongggg ....... not only did they get the wrong figure skating rules, but also they GIRLS Ice Hockey rules. In GIRLS ice hockey you can not check. You also do not block someone. Not all girls are disgusting and big. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and I was invited to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players hate skaters. Many of the current hockey players have been skaters. We also skate much faster than the movie. I was embarrassed by the film that gave people the idea that we suck ....... although I must mention that it is difficult to make the transition between sports because of the choice of feet in skates .... also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice that you could not do in a regular hockey game. She basically tripped over the person, which is illegal. It is also unrealistic that she has a HOCKEY scholarship when skating. This really made me angry because the scholarship would normally be used for someone who could benefit the team.
