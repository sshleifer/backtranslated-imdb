My brother is an avid collector of DVD. He took a look at the cover (two models in bathrooms) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him to watch what turned out to be probably the most horrible movie (I use that term loosely) that I felt compelled to sit through. I dared not make eye contact with my brother, certain that he must be cursing the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name in the entire film is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in a scene, which the "filmmaker" decided to show in each scene (about four in total) throughout the film. In fact, the whole movie follows this process. The fact that the DVD contained deleted images was a shock. (I went to bed without seeing this, though). Not surprisingly, I found this record without your case behind the TV about a week later.
