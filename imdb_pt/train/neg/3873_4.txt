Alicia Silverstone portrays a modern, crime-obsessed teen trying to solve the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B movie, which is not especially well done, but is nevertheless surprisingly serious in relation to its main character. Silverstone is attractive and successful in carving a young and interesting woman here, although the image is destroying the kitsch. The supporting cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence in the last act goes overboard. It's not a cheese camping party, but nothing exceptionally memorable either. * 1/2 of ****
