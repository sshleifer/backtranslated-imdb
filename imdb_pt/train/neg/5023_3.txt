Nobody, but no one, could chew the scene like the Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and "Elizabeth and Essex" is a great example because. Although she overdoes the part at times, watch as she gawks at Raliegh writing the lyrics of a song that the ladies are about to play: at that moment, she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to rule and rule at all! At other times, she is satisfied with the fragility of the script. When Elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she comes out weak and grumpy. This has the additional effect of undermining its authority: when it explodes and threatens to dispense justice, it is difficult to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes charm, making us see how Essex got his way into Elizabeth's heart, but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and pure evil of man. Nor does it help that Essex is badly subscribed. Why is he this hot guy who wants to overthrow his Queen - even when he swears allegiance to her - except for the fact that he is more bloodthirsty, therefore, more "worthy" of government? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and Essex's letters? He does not risk falling out of favor and we know where Essex (and his head) are headed. So why does he risk his own head hastening the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do with all the money he got? He does not even bother trying to hide the fact that his battle scenes are filmed on a sound stage. He should have ended up with Elizabeth for the first time alone in the Tower; everything that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are fantastic. And is it me, or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
