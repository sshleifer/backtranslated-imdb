With movies like this, you know you're going to get the usual jokes about ghosts. Eva as a ghost is very funny. And the other actors also do a good job. It is the direction and history that is missing. This could have been neglected if the jokes worked better. The problem is that there are not many jokes. Of course I laughed a few times. In addition to the talking parrot, there was not a trace of creativity to be noticed in the film. I blame the director not using the premise to their full potential. Eva certainly has the comic ability to show more but has not had the opportunity to do so. Overall, this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. Other than that, it can be completely ignored.
