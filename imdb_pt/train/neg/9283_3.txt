I do not know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big fan of vonnegut and I'm very familiar with the story that this original Showtime movie bastardized beyond belief, but even if I was not, the poor actor, VERY poor cast (Sean Astin as the bright, athletic and all-around guy , Harrison? The guy is completely generic!) And the writing below the standard made this cloak almost invisible. Someone pointed out how cute the Maculay Culkin line was. If you read this and thought it was pure comic brilliance (unfortunately, it was probably the most INTENTIONALLY funny part of the movie), you might like this movie. But if you are a fan of Vonnegut or not completely insane, do not see it. Please.
