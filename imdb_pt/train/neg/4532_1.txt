My husband and I bought the Sesame Street Old School DVD for our daughter and I have to say, I do not let her watch the new episodes on TV because I find all the characters annoying. Baby Bear and Telly? OMgosh, how boring and useless can anyone think of their 'sketches'? Elmo? Rest, not every child likes him, again, annoying and teaches nothing to my son. Mr. Noodle? that bounce I think the only time I changed the 'new' show to her, she and I became more idiots than before. The show definitely took a wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Mage, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the big school sketches of the Old School SS Sesame Street suffered a direct hit from boredom and stupidity since the death of Jim Henson in 1990. The program no longer has the educational, funny and interactive sketches that used to do. I find the new versions simply unbearably annoying and full of useless non-educational gossip. Way to go The producers / writers of S.S. you have one more cartoony show for the parents to sit there non-creative, not exercised children in front so that they will get out of their hair. By producers / recorders: I suggest you take the old ones and start recording content similar to the first Sesame Street. God knows I do not want my son to speak like Baby Bear or Elmo.
