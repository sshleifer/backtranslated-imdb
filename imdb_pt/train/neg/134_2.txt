This movie by far was super smart. It's rhyming theme with all the horror movies ever made. Valentine makes ZERO try to be original. What is Valentine, anyway? It's a lot of people giving each other the same messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original about Valentine. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once, and the one you're seeing here are some of the movies that were stolen. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which someone is killing someone. <br /> <br /> I know there's more, but my mind was slowly turning into a silk puddle so I could not catch them as fast as they came. <br /> <br /> Valentine had no chance to be a good movie. How does every horror movie have to have a killer of "surprise", people you do not care about, because your emotions alternate in all other scenes. One minute, a cool girl turns into an evil B - ch, so she 's an insecure woman, and so on and son. <br /> <br /> Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, again Valentine does not have it. It was as if they tried to make it PG-13, but they failed, so they left the edition. <br /> <br /> Do not see this overly inspired, theft unless you hate yourself, and you want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
