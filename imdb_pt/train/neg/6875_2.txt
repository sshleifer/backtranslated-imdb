Half attracted by the erotic scenes, only to realize that this was one of the most amateur and unbelievable movies I've ever seen. Kind of like a college film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking? And what about all those stock characters in that bizarre Midwestern town? It's very difficult to get involved with. There are no lessons to be learned, there are no bright insights, just bright and pretty ridiculous (but a lot of skin, if that intrigues you), an absurdity videotaped ... What happened to the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all heterosexual encounters. And what happened to this absurd dance, with everyone playing their stereotyped roles? Give this one a pass, it's like a million miles of bad movie, wasted money that could have been spent on hungry children or AIDS in Africa .....
