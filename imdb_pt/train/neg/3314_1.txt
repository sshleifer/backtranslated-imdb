Reading all these positive reviews, I am perplexed. How many have liked what I consider to be a bad adaptation of my second favorite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the film, already mentioned in some reviews; In other words, Ewan McGregor and Toni Collette put on a performance that is simply a chic, exaggerated and exaggerated mess of opening credits for the quarter-finale. <br /> <br /> Worthy of them, the worst by far is Paltrow. I really enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious, nasal, relaxed and completely disconnected from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort - although even a perfect Emma could not have saved that movie.
