Making a film about the prequels and the "true" Star Wars trilogy would charge even a great filmmaker ... Mr. Lucas is not that filmmaker. Picture the fall of a movie. The good man in the dark needs a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are extremely annoying with only a few pockets of even more lightsaber fights but there is a lack of advantage because you already know which main characters survive the original Star Wars . Count Dookan (Christopher Lee) has a very fleeting role here and the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks in silence! <br /> <br /> No, the film just catches up with the Chancellor on the Jedi and has a great sequence (overlong) in the lava falls
