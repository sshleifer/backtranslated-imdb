I had the misfortune to waste 10 pounds buying new SS movie on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually suspend my belief by watching movies like that. A pinch of salt and a few beers on a dark night on the couch watching a noisy night shoot up is perfect for a single alpha male like me. I bought this movie thinking of seeing cool martial arts and shoot 'em up. <br /> <br /> I did the hell. Segal is old and bloated, the plot was ridiculous even by SS standards and to crown everything out of Segal's acting (as it was to start with) is exceptionally ghastly. So terrible, in fact, that half his voice was dubbed by a man who did not seem ANYTHING to him. Or the SS no longer act (a moot point) of the crew were so terrible in their jobs that they could not record the sound properly. The voice wavered between Mr. Whisper Segal and the man announcing the Honda announcements! <br /> <br /> It's not the plot issue because most action movies work on the same premise as this, nothing new there. The usual mix of characters who will die horribly like cannon fodder and stereotyped bandits waiting to be taken away. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as you would avoid riding in front of a train at high speed or a dose of H5N1 avian influenza. <br /> <br /> Total trash <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This was a public health alert.
