The original movie, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've ever seen, almost perfect. A story of Lady and the Tramp in two ways - rich girl / poor boy and skill vs. lineage. The sequel, however, is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original, but also a ridiculous and exaggerated Disney mess, better summed up as "Rambo meets the black stallion." Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero returns from an absence of 3 years and suddenly he is the Superman on horseback; in the original film, well, he was real and believable, but sadly reduced to a cartoon following. I was hardly so disappointed in a movie, and sometimes it made me very angry - they barely noticed a clich√©. Audacious Manipulation of the Audience - Do studio bosses think that all you have to do with a horse-loving public is to put beautiful horses in front of them to make them happy? A mess of a movie.
