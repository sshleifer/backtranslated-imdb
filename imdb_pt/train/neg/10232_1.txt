It's one of those dramas that is so bad it almost gets to be really funny, the script is absolutely terrible, terrible direction, purely armed lighting, the only thing that leaves out from a real one so bad is good to feel is that the sound the design is just too bad; does not add suspense to history, though it strives but does not destroy at least any discourse. There are problems with continuity of shooting seasons all through the door. And last but not least, the acting is terrifying. For a professional production, it has the feel of a college media project that you have to feel sorry for the apologies for anyone who has to put their names on it.
