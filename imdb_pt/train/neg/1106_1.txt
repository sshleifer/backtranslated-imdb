Do not waste your time on this trifle. As portrayed, the characters have no redeeming values ​​and watching them interact is pure torture. "Gothic" was entertainment, at least, this sucks. If you enjoy seeing pretentious and pampered poets struggling to outdo each other, this may be on your way. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete idiot, and why others prefer to spend more than five minutes with him is truly disconcerting. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character with any spine, but even so she leaves the whole ordeal without a trace of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember seeing another top movie based on the same subject, but I did not get the title. I was hoping it was, but I was not so lucky. Not recommended.
