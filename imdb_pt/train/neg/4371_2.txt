After leaving the popular television show "The Andy Griffith Show," Don Knotts gave the film a worthy attempt at a series of futile but full of matinee comedy vehicles. Unfortunately, The Reluctant Astronaut, filmed at low cost (as well as most of Knotts films), is much worse than the others. Don plays a schnook from a small town who is accepted into the astronaut training camp ... but not as a space travel candidate - they want him as their new caretaker! Some may say that weak satire capitalizes on the new American fever for the new age of technology, but the film is just an excuse to keep the restless children occupied. It starts well, with an OK setup and nostalgic locations, but it becomes more and more spiritless and idiot. * in ****
