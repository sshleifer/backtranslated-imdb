I love MBBS munna bhai but "Lagge raho ..." SUX really SUX. I've never seen such a boring movie in my entire life. And these high rates really surprised me that wat happened to the taste of moviegoers in Indian cinema? <br /> <br /> ** CAN BE SPOILER ** An educated girl needs advice from a Bhai, people discussing their personal probabilities. on phones come in man from which part of the world you r ??? I agree that movies should be fictional, but these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars are for 15 minutes of good start)
