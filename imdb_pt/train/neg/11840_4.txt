Anything that may have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a warning that the events we are about to see can not be known and "This is the most whispered whisper" about one of Hollywood's most sensational "mysteries" . <br /> <br /> Ok. So we're not getting anything new (and "Mysteries & Scandals" from E! It gives you a better basis for the particular incident ... and that's not much of an endorsement) . What do we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is a nest of vipers and decadents. No big news there. More interesting is knowing what a frustrated director is willing to do to regain his power position in the entertainment industry and / or political establishment. This raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking of his own experience through these characters. But what is said is so cynical and ugly and confusing, we are feeling guilty for witnessing a lot of nonsense that is passed through history. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film has a crazy and curious quality that I find more annoying than fun. We are not empathic with anyone. And the great "Citizen Kane" ends the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In "The Cat's Meow," we are not sure of Davies's motives for being with Hearst. As soon as they tell us one thing, she's doing the other. And should we believe that Davies was the love of the chaplain's life? Or is he just trying to convince one of America's most powerful - and apparently idiots? The film never makes it clear. <br /> <br /> What is convincing is the values ​​of production. There is a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes. I have more to look at to build some of the lapels on the men's jackets than following a story that frees many of the best-known personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the script is pure fiction. The resignations that frame the film only make it even more hesitant and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Artists can not be criticized, even though Meg Tilly goes from parody here. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of ​​chewing scene. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but to the point of seeming to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it. One of his first lines is, "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she wishes she was not. <br /> <br /> This is not on the same level as Bogdanovich's garbage, which is so bad "At Long Last Love". He is excited to try something serious, but he hesitates and stumbles mainly because he is so full of bitterness about the "beast" called Hollywood. This is the cinema "National Enquirer". And that not only messes up the names of those the movie puts on board Oneida that weekend, but the audience gets pretty dirty, too.
