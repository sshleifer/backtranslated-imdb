Useless about a bunch of half-naked men pounding and pounding each other. That's it. For about 5 minutes, we see this. It is shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around pounding each other with the terrible music melody. It sounds interesting, but there is no plot and really - the violence inherent in it was disturbing. Also homo eroticism is thrown up, but blending it violently was not a good idea. Some people who like avant-garde material may like this, but I find it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (occasionally) disturbing. Really - what's the point in all this? I saw him as part of a gay shorts festival and the audience sat quietly. I really wish I could go below 1.
