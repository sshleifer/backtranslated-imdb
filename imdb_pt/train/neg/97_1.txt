I have not seen many low budget movies, I must admit, but this is probably the worst movie ever, the main character as the old man spoke, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds , a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most terrible plot, and well, the army guy had put what he thought was the army and then just exaggerated, I just watched laughing at how bad it was, and hoped he was leading to the real movie. I hypocrisy believe it was under the 2 night rental thing to blockbusters, instead of one please take it for free and take it out of our sight. I think there was a semi-decent actor other than the woman, I think the only good thing about the budget was makeup, but they show all the important scenes of the movie at the beginning of the song. Horrible just awful.
