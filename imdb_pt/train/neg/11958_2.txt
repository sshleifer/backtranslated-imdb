Ok, I got it. We should be horrified. The idea was planted. A girl is making her father and taking pictures of her. Call me about the shock-rock genre, but I ask for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall in love with it. But do not expect me to watch a soft porn and be horrified that she's "making her father" ... I mean, this convention did not become a bit abused in the adult movie industry that has already infiltrated with "rape and harassment ". 'Pornography ... Horror is not what your mind can fool you into believing. That's what really exists in the movie. This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choice of its own adventure.
