I will not spend much time or energy on this comment. I just want to add this because all the comments were so positive that I felt I had to let people know that not everyone is so excited, much less intellectually provoked by this attempt to create a captivating philosophical cinematic conundrum. Some scenes looked promising, playing with visual dimensions, but they could not handle the rest. I felt as if I had been stoned for the first time, having semi-philosophical conversations with teenage colleagues. What a futile attempt to elevate Dutch cinema to new heights. I would rather see that Jesus is a Palestinian, without all pretensions and direct humor, also raising questions about life and the realities we have created for ourselves. Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and apparently will never be.
