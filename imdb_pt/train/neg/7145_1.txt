Apparently Hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and speaking ability. This movie was painfully bad mind. The cast was terrible, the action unspeakable and the history filled with holes. Script? Who needs script? I was surprised that the movie was not as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be, however I have enough T & A photos to last a lifetime. The movie was like listening to a 19-year-old street runner with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell a story. Being so poorly scripted, I thought the two brothers in the movie were lovers in the beginning. The scenes on the race track, along with the leading female actress in the movie, made me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of movie that Grindhouse modeled after ... only the writers thought they were serious.
