Okay, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I even read a batman comic from time to time. So, as you can imagine - I got a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was ALWAYS disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like a long TOY commercial. No depth. And what the hell was it with the Joker? Who, in my humblest opinion, is the best Batman villain of all time and they KILLED IT. I wish I could say his design was the worst part. In fact, I wish I could say there was something about this series that was remotely creative or interesting. In short (because believe me I could say much more) do not waste your time on this show, or your money.
