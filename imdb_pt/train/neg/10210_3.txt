Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder has already done the majestic and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now it just seems to make "by the numbers" Hollywood thrillers. <br /> <br /> This is very light material John Grisham, crossed the plot of a TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a quarrelsome and independent crime investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is his reserved police partner, Sam Kennedy, and together they form an uncomfortable pair. It is not good when two unbalanced university disorders (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them into a wild chase - planting very clever and deceptive forensic evidence at the scene. Fair enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create any sparks, we also have to endure several overly melodramatic flashbacks that illustrate an important event in Cass's story. Then, of course, there are the frequent photos of a hut on the cliff side, where there is absolutely no doubt that the end of OTT will be set. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Watch any episode of CSI. It is to the point and much more exciting.
