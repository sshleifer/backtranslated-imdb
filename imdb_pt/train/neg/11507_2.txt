Guy Ritchie's noble endeavor is beaten, felled, raped, kicked, shot, stabbed, spit, punched, sodomized and abused and left to die for Madonna's terrible performance. His performance was very reminiscent of Al Gore's School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie made a rather noble attempt to redo this, and if you delete ALL the scenes that your wife was in, it's a fair movie at best. I think the best acting job of all time had to be Guy comforting his wife that his performance was good enough not to re-shoot. If you have the opportunity to watch Swept Away or cut your toenails for 89 minutes ... go to the extended pedicure.
