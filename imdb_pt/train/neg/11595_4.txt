STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning *** Alice, having defeated Freddy at the end of the last film, is now trying to readjust his life. But your unborn child is carrying a demonic presence - Freddy, trying to get back into their world. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note the directors who have had their great opportunities directing Freddy's films - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cliffhanger Island, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins But while Russell and Harlin did a good job, Hopkins IMO did something a podge with this entry, which should be quickly forgotten. The story is clearly being extended as far as you can go here, with Freddy ridiculously father and the ridiculous baby demon. Even with about an hour and a half, everything gets pretty tiring, and of course, it's not scary at all. slogan "good appetite, bitch" is the only memorable point of this other sentence. wise entry very forgettable. *
