Usually any movie with Sylvester Stallone is usually a drug. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception to this. The only films Sylvester Stallone was good at were Rocky and First Blood. This movie is extremely unrealistic and boring. It has action, but not very good action. I did not like to watch it, and I would never watch it again. No wonder he won the Razzie Award for Worst Picture. I would give it a 3/10, the only reason he got the 3 was because he had a somewhat good action, but not enough.
