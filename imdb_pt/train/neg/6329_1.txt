I saw this film misery in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (when tickets actually sold for $ 1). This is the only movie I ever went out with (my friend, while the idiocy that is the "Laser Bra 2000" sketch was on screen). Of course, the reaction of my and my friend to the film was common. It's not that I found the film offensive (as an 18-year-old or now), but rather that it is stupidly boring and patently bland, devoid of even the unintended humor that makes a movie of Ed Wood be watched. That's the real reason NBC refused to release it, instead of not understanding Mike's "vision" (unless, of course, his vision was to get the film's supporters into bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I was surprised to this day to know that this movie does not seem to have published any list "10 worst movies of all time". It certainly does mine. You have been warned.
