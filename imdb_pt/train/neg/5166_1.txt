Terrible acting, lame plot, stupid story and just every terrible movie sums up this piece of crap. It was unbearable to sit down. Simply horrible. Do not waste a penny on that. Cinemas should feel bad for actually putting this movie on for people to watch. This horror movie was not at all scary, scary or disturbing. It was not visually appealing. The acting was so terrible by all the actors that any attempt to lure him into the film through dialogue is completely destroyed at times when the actor / actress opens his mouth. Besides the whole story, I do not know why anyone would make a movie with this story AGAIN. Do not waste your time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, do not waste a moment watching this movie. You'll feel dumber to watch.
