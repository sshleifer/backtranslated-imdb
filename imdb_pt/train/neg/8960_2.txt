the only thing that frequently pops into my head while I'm writing this comment is, I'll never get that hour and a half back !!! to indicate that I'm not just blowing air, I'll compare the movie with the other films in the trilogy of cube (cube and hypercube)! The cube was not great, but it was original and made up for some technical flaws! As a sequel lost the advantage of originality, but it came out very beautiful and I even liked the cube (the story was better)! but the zero cube in comparison to its predecessors really is not worth it, a complete lack of good fx, a very f * ck * d script and simply a bad acting do not match well! example: all the time during the movie I was thinking would be incredibly stupid if ... it should happen and then it would happen, so it's not very original either! my advice: do not miss this hour and a half I missed !!!!!!!! oh and I hope this movie crashes and burns !!!!!!!
