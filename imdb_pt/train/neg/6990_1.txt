What the hell is this? It's one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand why people on this site love it so much. Its meaningless and nudity for no reason. It's worse than Resident Evil. I strongly do not recommend unless you want to watch chess, bad acting crap. Watch real movies like Stephen King's, The Shining, Jurassic Park (noon), JAWS, etc. Leave that crap of rent when there's nothing else to rent. It's as bad as Crudy vs. Gayson. Attack of the Killers Tomatoes is better than this crap. <br /> <br /> Oh wow meat eating zombies. How many zobie movies do we need? Ignore this one <br /> <br /> * outta ****
