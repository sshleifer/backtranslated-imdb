I had to change my mind about the worst movie in the world having just seen this one. THAT'S THAT! <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> Plot without hope (though it is based on a real story). Terrible acting (which was the thought of Judge Reinhold) Incredibly bad stunts. Child dialogue Continuity non existent. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> get the picture? <br /> <br />
