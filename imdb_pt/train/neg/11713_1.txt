Just a warning ... This is the worst movie I've seen in years ... I could not watch it until the end ... It's a sheer waste of time ... I'm really sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie. There really is not much to say about it. Horrible acting, incredibly bad lines, history, everything. The only reason I advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie should not be. Just to tell you a scene: the police are looking for Snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are firing inside the building, but they are still whispering so that Snipes does not suspect anything.
