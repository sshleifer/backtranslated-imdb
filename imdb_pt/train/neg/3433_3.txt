It's such a weird movie, you can say it's horrible or if you sit down with friends can give you a killer laugh. Strange comes to mind again and again. She shot amateur, acted even worse and directions, maybe none. The special effects are funny, but the music that accompanies a baby flying demon will surely be the greatest success. See if you have time to kill. But do not even try to take it seriously. It should be a tribute to the "porn holocaust." As I have not seen, the homage I can assume is so bad. Should have given it a 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it gets an excessive 3. Gore, the only thing anyone worked on. Stay away, if you're picky, more gore than laughter. I wonder if the manufacturers had a laugh doing it?
