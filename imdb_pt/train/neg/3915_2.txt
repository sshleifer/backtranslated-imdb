This film is not only poorly scripted and directed, but it is simply unpleasant. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes were made to the plot, presumably to expedite the timeline. But the result is simply confusing. The acting can not overcome the script, which removes the motives of the characters by their behavior. In addition, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch ESTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please, please, please read the beautiful novel, in Spanish, if possible. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
