Me and my sister now watch this movie. We have laughter for the deaf. Can you imagine in covers there is indication for the Oscars? - First, the musician has a mix of 4-5 different styles of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes and the character moves ... <br /> <br /> --- The main character Silvester does not fit there. it looks like the Mexican Tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- Russian soldiers are everything but Russian faces :-) ----- ok, the main points: 1. plane called charter painted black. . <br /> <br /> 2. what's an idea when Rambo will jump off the plane but he got stuck? 3. a girl? the best scene is when she dies. She means a lot to him. Has he known her for a long time? he cries for her ... my god samurai 4. how many arrows does he have? Is his arrow bag always full of arrows? I did not notice a scene where he collects them - but I saw the scene where the arrow is on the welding head of Vietnam - this is very important 5. How many rockets can the helicopter handle? (real) I saw 4. but the Rambos hit about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. the main part. What do Russian Special Army helicopters do in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7. First scene when he enters the Vietnam camp ... his first idea was to free the refuge that is standing in the tree in the open space 'wow, what idea of ​​what again: 1. with the knife you can cut the iron thread? maybe just made in Vietnam? 2. mortar - using to hit a running man? my god, u Americans really need to learn about guns! you know how much you need to calibrate the mortar (I think the writer has watched many WWII movies)
