Barry, a medical transcriptionist has his mind eroding from his work along with memories of an abusive education at the hands of his stepfather, Barry (the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen). He spirals into madness and eventually a serial killer. Good (in the form of a gay man) and evil (in the form of a mute bald man) battle for control of his soul. This movie is undone by some bad and unintentional mood scenes. Not to say it's horrible or anything, except you say it's just as known as it is because of Bruce Campbell's fanatical base (of which I'm one) that you'll probably see anything he's involved in some way.
