I've never done a movie online, but I felt motivated to do it after seeing this movie. One does not appear at someone's funeral and says to the mourners, "My relatives died, so why should I care about theirs?" <br /> <br /> Without advertising, there was little, if anything, that could be called "art." As the daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly irritated by the use of deafness as a trick. Any deaf person who felt a vibration of this immensity probably would have investigated, not ignored. <br /> <br /> The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer, there are few subjects I would stay away from: the Holocaust is one of them; this is another. I wish these filmmakers had not been so arrogant (and inept).
