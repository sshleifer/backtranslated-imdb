This movie was bad from the beginning. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to get a high score. The acting was horrible. The murders were staged very poorly. Like when Ally was stuck in that toilet, I think she was in the abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie arrives and Molly and the other guy are in the hut, you see Ally, so Angela must have gone to get her. The part that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar string and put it on. One of them was a horrible performance and two why would not you turn around and punch the bitch?!?!? So when Molly is being chased by Angela, if you have the neighborhood, why not just turn around and stab her? So stupid. This movie sucked ...
