This movie was almost intolerable to sit on. I can go beyond the fact that it looks like it was filmed with a home video camera and that this movie should last for weeks, but the characters do not change their clothes, but the acting broke the 4th wall in pieces for me. I've seen better acting in a fourth grade piece. Also, the plot is unrealistic. If the man suspected the subject, he would have given it to him. I was also very disappointed that all the murders were made with a gun, what kind of thing that is. This is not an imitator that the Zodiac did not kill using only a gun, the authorities would know it was not him. Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders and not the name of the disorder. Overall, I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done on a low budget, at least not as low as they, or they could be sure they had better or more bloody actors. A lot of people have gone the low budget route without having to use horrible actors to look for Easy Rider that had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
