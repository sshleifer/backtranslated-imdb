Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director, but imagine what he could have done with it! The plot has a lot of potential for suspense. John Garfield is almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is eerily pitted against the guy. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive protagonist, but the support cast is big and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, it starts to give way too soon. There are too many coincidences. And an important subject is trivialized by being transformed into little more, in the end, than a love story. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch Garfield, Massey and the performers. But it's not very good.
