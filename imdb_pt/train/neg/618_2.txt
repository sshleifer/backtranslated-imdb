Maybe one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. I'll start with the negatives of the movie, which pretty much covers the entire film. First of all, something that nobody can avoid: TERRIBLE THANKS. I swear they caught some random kids out on the street based on how they looked. Secondly, BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You hardly know half the children who are dead here. All you imagined is that they deserved it one way or another. The character of the scarecrow was exaggerated, and a cheap theft of the other great fantasy killers, such as Freddy or Pinhead. In the next: BAD DIALOG: The Scarecrow was full of horrible phrases that made you laugh, just because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's find some small animals to torture!" really only leaves you with a raised eyebrow. Last but not least: Next off: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? Do you like 30? The back of his head was bald for the love of God. There's a lot more I could say about this movie, as if it was a cheap special effect, it's a "high school movie class" effort, but the point is understood. It's just a bad movie being worse. As for what I found to be "good" in the movie: -Lovering for those with low, low, low standards -It could help put insomniacs to sleep. A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.
