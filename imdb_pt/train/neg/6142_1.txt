Gymkata is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made. But not the bad kind of bad movies. This one is so horrible that it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting. He should go back to the gym. But who can forget memorable scenes like the high bar with chalk, the horse with stone handles or the pursuit of five minutes through the village of the crazy in slow motion. I do not think this was meant to be so bad but who can say. It is not art, but if you want something light and fluffy that makes a good conversation, rent gymakta. It makes a night of fun.
