This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was kind of a remake, but again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had lots of makeup and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original movie that was made for less than $ 6 million? No. Then in that respect, the movie fails. <br /> <br /> At least in the original film, the Statue of Liberty scene was shocking, but there was nothing shocking about that movie or the final scene, because you can see it coming. And by the way, if you think a little, and I did, you can find out how the ending can happen. I just wish I had back the time I lost thinking about it. <br /> <br /> This movie would have been brilliant and entertaining if it stayed the way the first film was and adopted part of "Beneath the Planet of the Apes". Here's how I would have written: An astronaut (really should have been more than Marky Mark because he is not good enough to care for a movie alone, so I would have put three faces) that would land on humans (not mute), a city ruled by monkeys, were hunted, made friends with some good monkeys, discovered that they are on the earth, finding some ruined ruins, run into crazy mutant humans living under the ground, a war erupts between mutant humans and monkeys, and then ... well, let your imagination run wild in how you want to end it. <br /> <br /> But my point is that there could have been a lot more for this movie. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to ruin a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director, despite what people think. He is fashionable, so he should be good goes the thought. I'm sorry but no. If someone had made this movie, it would have been much better and would have been much more satisfying.
