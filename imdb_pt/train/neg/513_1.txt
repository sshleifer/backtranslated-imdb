Burt Reynolds reached a point in his career where he seemed to be just going through the motions. He would show up, party with his friends at the movies, and bring home a big salary. It did not seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was sheer crap. <br /> <br /> No movie symbolized this more than "Stroker Ace", which makes "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball". I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I do not know what to do. "<br /> <br /> If Burt's thought of pretending with Jim Nabors and dressing like a chicken looks funny, then this is his movie. Otherwise, choose almost any other movie comedy and it will not be any worse.
