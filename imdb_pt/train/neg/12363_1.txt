This is one of those movies that were apparently trying to take advantage of the madness of the martial arts waves. Kind of like Billy Jack, I guess. However, while Billy Jack has had a remarkable martial arts scene, there is none in this, unless you consider a fight and gentleman brawl as such. We are introduced to the star who is described as having learned judo in the Marines. I was in the Marines and while they're well established in boxing, I do not really remember any emphasis on Judo. As a result, the antagonist, James Macarthur, refers to Judo when he offers an excuse for why he, a state champion fighter was so easily defeated. Lame.
