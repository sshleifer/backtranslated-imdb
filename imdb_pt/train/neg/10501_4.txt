Some people say that the wiles and gregarious personality of Steve Irwin are just one act. Watch this movie: it's obvious he can not act. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, a dangerous little screen star in his Crocodile Hunter Diaries, Croc Files and Crocodile Hunter series, do you see a naming trend here, or is it just me? rockets his persona larger than contend for the big screen with * Crocodile Hunter: Course of collision * (yup? there is a definite trend of words beginning with 'C') - basically an episode of * Crocodile Hunter * mixed with a B-Movie . <br /> <br /> On a mission to relocate a large croc to save him from being shot by an eccentric farmer (Magda Szubanski), Steve and Terri's wife does not know that the crocodile is being tracked by American spies (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom) to retrieve a satellite spy signal he swallowed. It hurts my credibility to say "Are they on a collision course with madness"? (What credibility? - Ed's note.) The plot is irrelevant, as is Steve's animal magnetism that drives the movie. If you think his persona is trying, the movie is a failure, but if you're a fan of it (as a businessman, conservationist, or simply drunk) or your television shows, expect more of it in a movie. screen budget. <br /> <br /> John Stainton, faithful faithful, best friend and helper of the Crocodile Hunter, works (can it be said with a serious face?), writes and directs with the same provincial arrogance that made Steve one domestic wildlife fool. <br /> <br /> The most shocking aspect of this movie is that Steve (one of the few people to whom you can actually hear the exclamation points while speaking) and Terri (Steve, a 10-year-old wife, next) treat it as one of its documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and speaking directly to the camera, while all other characters behave as if they were in a bad movie (well ??). Would not it be so incongruous if Steve and Terri were kept apart from the rest of the characters? but when bad guys constantly threaten Steve's life, we, Confused Viewers, should ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew does not call the cops if they do not try to nudge the bad guys with the microphones, or run screaming bush ?? nothing but continue filming casually with great lighting, clear audio and seven angles of action. <br /> <br /> While Terri is unfairly painted as Steve's slightly incompetent partner (his performance consists of boldly ineffective readings in tight pear-shaped jeans - by the latter, I'm not complaining) Steve does his job of showing and rely on creatures determined to kill him, doing all their action scenes because, well, to him they are not really stunts, just a day at the office. <br /> <br /> Of course observing this madman's koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in September 2006 causes a strange distancing from the process. But for those of us who have never met him, this type of malarkey (as well as several incarnations of the Crocodile Hunter series in constant reruns) keeps him alive as ever in our crocodile holes. The painful reality of his absence will only be apparent to those closest to him. And do I really wish them the best in following in their disproportionate size footprints ?? <br /> <br /> So take this detour for what it is ?? a half-cooked movie with a full caption. Did he die doing what he loved? interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film by portraying him doing just that. <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
