***** probably minor spoilers ****** I can not say I liked it, but I can not say no ... it's very strange. There are bad things, like a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine, if I were the director I would cut that part for sure, it made me want to stop watching the rest of the movie. .. For some people, it will be annoying because they have no action, sit at home sometimes ... Take for example a scene where one of the friends died and the next thing they are doing is what? Nop, do not cry ... your horror stories telling each other .. * sighs * (only after crying for he lost) * Another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat that they had like "hundreds" of candles on the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by some sort of rag curtains (old rags covering the windows) and sofas / sofas ... I thought it was dumb, using candles but not thinking about the surroundings, besides being on the high seas alone ... <br /> <br /> The good, some scary scenes are well made I liked some. Sometimes the horror works best when it's hidden when it's behind something instead of showing, so this movie is good, maybe because it's a low budget I do not know, but it works well for me! You will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much of it! but if you like any kind of movie watch this, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry for my raw English) =) <br /> <br /> Congratulations
