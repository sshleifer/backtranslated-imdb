The American Humane Association, which is the source of the family warning "No animal was injured ..." (AHA trademark), began monitoring the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to jump to death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the movie Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the heinous act kills the entire entertainment aspect of this movie to me. I suppose one could say that at least the horse did not die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the insensitive and horrible pain that caused animals to the glory of the cinema, but I can not help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this certainly would not be the path he would have taken!
