This movie seemed to be fun and interesting from its description. But for me it was a little disappointing. Very slow and difficult to follow and see what was happening. It was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them into the air and attached them anyway they landed (definitely not in sequential order). Also, nothing of any consequence was being filmed. I've seen a lot of different Korean films and I noticed that a lot of it is well done and requires some thinking from the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this one confused me without end. I watched the movie a second and third time and still have not done anything for me. I still do not understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. If it were only to show a mundane portion of a person's life, I think he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
