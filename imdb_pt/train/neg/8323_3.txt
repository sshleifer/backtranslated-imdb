From the beginning, this movie had some flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a wealthy young tycoon who inherited his father's considerable wealth and power, and he is struggling to fill his father's shoes and cut the apron that his mother (and co-executive) keeps it too tight. He also has the problem of having a heart problem and waiting in limbo which is the organ donor registry. There are also minor backstories that his first instinct is to ignore the majority that becomes important later, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Non-creative story lines, but not bad enough to spoil the movie. The only true "oy vey!" moment was the name of the character of Lena Olin. Arrogant woman named Lilith ... subtle! <br /> <br /> The surgical scenes are not at all censored. I appreciated that people who find scary surgery scenes might not like it. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was well done at first. You watch in emotional agony as Christensen screams internally through the incision in the chest and the rib spreader. The irony of the trailers then comes where, while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also lucky as it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to assassinate him. The big turnaround, however, is very predictable and sends the movie investigating the conspiracy and its memories of the little signs that were there, but it, like us, initially lost. Two more twists in the end involve her relationship with her mother. One of them is an impressive gesture from Olin, which does not impress due to poor writing. The other is a secret about the family's past, which seemed very crossed out and meaningless. <br /> <br /> The initially well-made anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama. There is a final attempt to bring him back, he falls, taking the whole movie with him.
