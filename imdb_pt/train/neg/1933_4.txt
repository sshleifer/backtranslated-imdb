Final Score (an average of several classic cinematic qualities - acting, visual effects, creativity, reward, humor, fun, ect): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (in 10) <br /> <br /> Atlantis: The Emperor's New Groove "and marks a step back in freeing up Disney's" The Lost Empire, "which was released a few years ago, would have seemed a serious and bold new direction in Disney animation. "Atlantis" is an animated setback to "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and similar live science fiction adventures. (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame), and the characters are little more than a single, walking cliche of the usual suspects who typically and populate this type of film (the eccentric mechanics, the general general, the tough and brash women). In addition to Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the support cast is totally unpleasant. The film also suffers from a succinct rhythm. Instead of summarizing in an epic story, Disney makes many stops in the short span of time, usually brushing up opportunities to develop ... suspensions, characters, anything really. They draw us into this new and wonderful world and barely let us see. The awkward rhythm sometimes confuses what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dark and cheap. This thing looks like a Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they have not forgotten that traditional 2D animation can still be wonderful. "The Iron Giant," among others, proved this. <br /> <br /> Negatives: The visual, the rhythm and the pure lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positives: Quite possibly the coolest death scene for a Disney villain in a long time. It's the creative highlight of the movie.
