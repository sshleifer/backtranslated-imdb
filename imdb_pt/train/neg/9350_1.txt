This movie was terrible. The first half hour is a lot like ... well, sorry for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of The Mechanical Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! It was supposedly a tribute, depending on the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall, however "ripoff" is the most appropriate word. The film seemed to have been ripped off since Kubrick's classic, just filmed through the eyes of a new director. A blind director. Unfortunately, when it halts the massacre of Kubrick's work, the film gets even worse. As another commentator said, the depth of this film is just pushed through your throat. Drivel arrogant, self-absorbed and ultimately meaningless. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the ramblings of the protagonists affected a nerve if there were any real character development in that film. I did not feel anything at all for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I guess if anyone could feel anything for him, it would be me. Terrible character development, dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the title. For a movie called "16 years of alcohol," alcoholism is hardly a factor in the movie. See the first paragraph - it was a massacre of Mechanical Orange that I can not overcome. A more appropriate title would have been "16 Years of Violence," or, better still, "A Mechanical Banana." <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you disregard my advice and withdraw it anyway, drink. Trust me.
