Guy Richie's third film (not counting the horrific "Swept Away" is a complex action thriller related to gambling, gangsters and chess.) Fans of Richie's earlier efforts will likely hate Revolver as much as I do with their twists. Jason Statham plays Jake, a newly released ex-convict, to take revenge on the ridiculously-named Dorothy Macha (a superb OTT Ray Liotta), but instead gets involved with a couple of other cons (one of them is Andre 3000 from the group of rap Outkast) who played for him and for us the audience, a series of clues throughout the film, which makes it extremely tedious. The high point of this film a mess is the part in the restaurant where the dialogue is turned down in favor of a superbly shot in slow motion with Sonata in the moonlight of Beethoven. In all, Revolver is a defective work, not really horrible, but far from the best of Richie. This would still be Lock, Stock. If this movie were to be u m school homework would be assessed 'should try harder!'
