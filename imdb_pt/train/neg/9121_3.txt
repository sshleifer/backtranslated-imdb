This is not a terrible comedy, but it's very DULL. He barely laughs and squanders his prodigious production values. There is a poignant moment near the end when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "enemy" and tells him that "You have been my only worthy opponent, and now we can start all over again." This scene, however, along with Burt Kwouk's entertaining appearance in the beginning, are the only memorable parts of the film. (* 1/2)
