The views of Earth alleged in this film as having been falsified by NASA were recently compared to the historical meteorological data of the Apollo 11 era and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual precipitation records. This seems to undermine the whole argument in the film that the "Whole Earth" image is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window. <br /> <br /> I hope that Bart Sibrel will now claim that historical weather data has been falsified by NASA, although this undoubtedly involves them as well as replacing every newspaper copy filed by one weather map, and those who are in private hands still be a problem. <br /> <br /> Oh, one answer: "Trying to discredit this movie, referring to NASA's meteorological data, I would say it's a charming but weak and gullible argument.

Unfortunately for him, his original film is in the public domain, and the excerpts that Sibrel edited contradict his claims.
