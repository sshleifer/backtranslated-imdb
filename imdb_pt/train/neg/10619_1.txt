... but a bad movie. As Maltin says this was Christopher Lee's attempt to make a serious horror film. Well, it's serious ... very serious! The plot is silly and slow (something about the elderly people who inhabit the bodies of small children to achieve immortality) ... the film is all talk, speak, speak, speak, speak, speak, speak about the same things one and again. I actually dozed off a couple of times! The movie is soooo boring! The cast dreams of this with the only exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but this was probably a labor of love for both of them (they often complained of horror movies being too violent ... well, that DOES NOT have violence!) . Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... this will put you to sleep!
