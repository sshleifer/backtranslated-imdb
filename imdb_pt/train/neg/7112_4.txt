Well, I have to admit that this was one of my favorites as a kid when I used to watch it on a home projector like a super-8 reel. Now there is not much to recommend, other than the inherent value of the actors' camp who are "terrified" by replicas of human skulls. The special effects are pretty silly, consisting mostly of skulls on wires and superimposed "ghost" images. <br /> <br /> But there is something to be said about the scenarios. The big mansion in which it happens is quite scary, especially since it is largely unfurnished (probably for budget reasons?). <br /> <br /> This definitely inspires more laughter than screams. Just try not to giggle when the wife (who does more than her shouting part) enters the greenhouse and is confronted with the ghost of her husband's ex.
