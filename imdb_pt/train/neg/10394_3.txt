With Knightly and O'Tool as protagonists, this movie had good odds, and with McCallum as the villain after Knightly, maybe a little bit of tension. But they threw it all away in the afternoon frill and, later, with the remains of war. It was clear that it was totally superficial, beautiful English country and coastline or not. The number one mistake was to dump Knightly so early in the movie when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older rather than picking someone ten years older to play the role. They lost all chances of having a big conflict between the cast and, instead, stupidly pulled the easy and low-cost elements of the heart.
