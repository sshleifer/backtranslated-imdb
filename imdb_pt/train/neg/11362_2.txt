"Fly Me To The Moon" has to be the worst animated film I've seen in a long time. That's saying something since I took my son to see all the animated versions of the last 4 years now. The story is to be generous ... banal. The dubbing is atrocious, very beautiful sounding. The mood is of the Romper Room variety. The animation is acceptable for a cartoon type of Nickolodeon, but this is being released on the big screen, not on cable television. <br /> <br /> You can only get a 2 because of the 3D 3D look. Some of the scenes have had a slightly exhilarating image, but we've seen much better in the past. I also question the filmmakers' insistence that the characters fly away from the screen, not in most scenes. Although this was interesting at first, it became tiring after the third or fourth time. It seemed a little indifferent to me on the part of the creators. <br /> <br /> I'll say that, however, it had a pretty cool soundtrack. And for the record my son was not too crazy about it either. Bad movie.
