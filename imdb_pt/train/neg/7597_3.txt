I love the representation of the 30's and 40's in the movies. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this photo. more. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, sir, there's no good in this. The only fun thing for me was that Colin Farrell's character is an unsure writer and this script, while addressing the juicy theme of racism, addresses the audience in the form of an ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> The only person who did not look like he was "acting" was Sutherland, and his minutes were few. <br /> <br /> Obsolete approach to a tired plot.
