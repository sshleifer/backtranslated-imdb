Funny that I find myself forced to review this movie, but here I am. <br /> <br /> I am reviewing because recently I had a chance to witness the rebirth of RC Sherri's "Journey's End" on stage in New York at the Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as being masterfully directed by David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I left broken theater. I'm not exaggerating, I was amazed. After almost two and a half hours of a re-created and very claustrophobic depiction of the soldier's life in the trenches of the Somme (speculum) during World War I brought life to life vividly, by all involved, I left the theater with Shakes. <br /> <br /> Do not worry, I'm not very sensitive either. I am a stage actor and a director, so I know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally and psychologically. <br /> <br /> But what I just witnessed, gave so much life, that I had chills in my spine when I left. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions came to life while watching "Aces High," the film based on this piece and even adapted to the screen in cooperation with RC The Sheriff himself, just before he died. <br /> <br /> The adaptation to the screen takes place in the skies of France. Then the claustrophobic weather disappeared to begin. <br /> <br /> The only advantage of the film is the aerial battle scenes that seem dated in their special effects compared to today's standards but still very valid in the flight tactics adopted on the screen. <br /> <br /> Granted there were a couple of screen adaptations of "All Silent On the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which happens in trenches, not in the sky, but this was the "German" view of things , if one would like to be choosy in such things. "End of the Journey" is just the other side of the medal, and would have done it in a great movie if they had left alone and intact. <br /> <br /> The transfer on DVD is poor, even in Widescreen and adapted for 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the film itself is that of a cinema. Nothing more, nothing less. It bears various defects, such as small scratches and dots, although the copy for the rest is clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another movie about World War I in your collection, especially for those who love and love to see aerial battles between veterans, then this is an image for you. But I prefer to suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although it is also a movie full of inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you, who love good acting and drama, I would leave this out. Buy the game. Go watch the play, if you have the chance to get a decent rebirth from her near you, but keep that possible adaptation. <br /> <br /> It's an anti-war movie, granted, but the weakest I've ever seen in my life ever. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud, is just a bluff, since they are only seen in very weak and very brief interpretations throughout the film. <br /> <br /> McDowell, the talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all perform very poorly, not because of the lack of skills but because of the lack of truth. and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are many gaps in it, and as stated before, it creeps into the dubious end. Doubtful because in the original play, none of the men we know and sympathize with remain alive. They are all dead on a fatal and futile mission. In the movie, they all die, except Malcolm McDowell, who somehow manages to stay alive the other day, being the commander of the unlucky wing, just to get three other pilots to fly and die for another lost cause. <br /> <br /> The end of the game leaves a stage naked in total darkness. You just hear the cannons roar, the machine guns rock and the grenade hits the whole theater. Then, suddenly, total peace and quiet. The curtain appears. Lights And here they all are. Aligned, erect and rigid. Obedient corpses ... Much more interesting and much more shocking than the end of "Aces High", which is also dragged by the hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do it, I would take the piece and develop it, the way it was made. Adding here and there some action scene on the field, just to visualize the "outer" horror and slaughter going on in the "voracious fields of France" around the men involved, but then, just by focusing strictly on what is happening, in that little "shack" on the brink of sanity and the world ... <br /> <br /> Do you want a movie like that? <br /> <br /> Then ask for it. <br /> <br /> That's not it.
