PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or does this guy always get over AB in their films together?). Some touching scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> CONS: The whole first hour (the jokes were flat, to say the least). All scenes involving the Rajpal Yadav. Great stupidity in AB decision making. Let me see if I understand, he believes that brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way (which will probably ruin his relationship beyond repair) is a better way for him to finally get Akshay to take some responsibility then actually telling her truth? WTF He thinks Akshaye is too weak to bear the fact that his OLD dad will die soon because of cancer, but do you think insulting him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who does not see the logic here? Easily the biggest flaw of the movie. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becoming a stuntman. LAUGHING A LOT!! We are told that he finished 1st in college every year and has a bachelor's degree in MBA. But when it comes time to support himself, and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stuntman. I LAUGHED A LOT!! How did you actually apply for a normal job in your field? Or Heck, anywhere else where your life is not in danger? This is an incredibly stupid writing. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate that kind of melodramatic crap. Everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for the AB character, which I could not. The whole thing reminded me a little too much of Srk in KHNH (which I hate). This crap of "please pity the guy with the disease" is on its way. I felt more like vomiting than sympathy for the old man. It was not possible to watch the last 20 minutes or so because of this and therefore had to pass quickly. the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Bottomline: Waqt is too dumb to be called a good movie. Its obvious director, Vipul Shah, looked at this in emotionally fragile girls and women who might care less about a story that really makes sense. Give them some decent music pictures, extravagant clothes, lots of scenes full of glycerin and some star power and they'll happily enjoy crap like that.
