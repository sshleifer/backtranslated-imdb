here, let me wave with my hands on the keyboard, I'll tell you what salad she'll order. More and more, it works like a charm: he's a genius, omg, how does he do it? my shit detector dodges if I pass this show when I'm scanning channels, I have to be very careful (currently this is often useful, so I do not need it to be broken into such stupid crap ... careful with that remote control!). Was this supposed to be a fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of Ubermanian control and domination? or what? Why does this exist? <br /> <br /> This is the most inhuman show, completely unbelievable and artificial, and I can not understand why it is still in the air. so the geeks give a lot better to show such a difficult time (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give a nonsense pass. shows like Firefly (if there were any) fall after a season, but nonsense like this, that makes logical sense, just keeps marching. yeccch.
