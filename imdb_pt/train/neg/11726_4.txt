Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a rent assassin, CIA agent and a neat and disgusting special agent. During his free time, Dial wears a cowboy hat and creates horses with macho names, such as Beauty. <br /> <br /> Enter Agent Collins, your supervisor. Enter a new task - kill a terrorist who is in the custody of the United Kingdom. Of course the UK being an allied state is a great place for covert operations and head shots outside the courts. <br /> <br /> Murder is a great success beyond the fact that the escape plan has exploded. So Dial's partner and local liaison are killed in action trying to escape the police while Dial becomes hot property with the London cops trying to get to him and the CIA trying to get rid of him. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dialing Safe House is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett) who loves hanging out with cold-blooded assassins with arrest warrants and helping them escape the bad order legal from the UK ... <br /> <br /> a script like that do I need to say more? On the plus side, Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (either a pro or a cheater) and the film is quite engaging. At least the issue is very disconnected and has a hurl effect on the stomach.
