The Comeback begins to look promising, with a brutal death scene by a matador with a mask. The mask itself is pretty cool too, and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990s horror film "Grandma." Since then, the film is boring. We have a few more deaths, which again are good, but there are not enough of them. The reason the deaths are so good is because they are frantic and bloody. The story behind the film is quite interesting and would have worked very well if it had not been so boring most of the time. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this, unless you are an obstinate collector - there is not enough here to make it an average slasher movie.
