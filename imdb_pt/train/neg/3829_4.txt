Train thief trapped near Yuma unleashes his gang of chains and turns to the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stock of gold that remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). The attempt to upgrade the Western genre with violence and brutality in the 1970s style is not even on the same level as some of the new westerns that emerged in the late 1960s. It is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters only around such as punching bags and possible rape victims. As the ex-sheriff back in charge, Charlton Heston gives one of his more lazy, less inspired performances (he has a good time, trying to read a letter and looking for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-witted half-breed, is also on autopilot, but Coburn manages to turn even the most agitated dialogue and situations into something thorny and unnerving. It's his show all the way. * 1/2 of ****
