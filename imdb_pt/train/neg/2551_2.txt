Misleading by the terrible lie on the cover, "fun like American Pie", my girlfriend and I sat across from the TV waiting for a comedy ... and this definitely is not one. You probably will not laugh once, if you're not one of those Jackass teenager minds. It's not even an erotic movie, which would at least be something, since it's about sex ... <br /> <br /> So what's this? The erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose his virginity (zero in originality, I remember "losing" by one) and his gang of friends. The rest of the characters (ie the girls) just come and go with no credible reason. Come on, there are even dwarves (so simple: "dwarves are fun ho ho" ...) The acting is very similar to TV (as is the video look throughout the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most girls ... Horrible movie. Amateur, poorly produced and, above all, NOT FUNNY. Kids and teens will love watching with friends because of the sex jokes and swearing. Other than that, do not even think about renting this movie.
