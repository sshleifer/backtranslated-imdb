I think I've seen this kind of thing before: college graduates do not realize they have it really good, all the time, complaining that their lives suck. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly derived from The Big Chill. and Reality Bites of what I can make of it: they pretty much have the same plot. <br /> <br /> If anything good came out of that snoring fest, it was the song. That's it. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed ... but again, I never expected anything less. This film was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another film that should only be seen with a blindfold. <br /> <br /> Now for the verdict: it's 1 in 10.
