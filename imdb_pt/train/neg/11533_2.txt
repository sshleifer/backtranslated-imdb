If derivative and predictable rapes of rape revenge are your thing, then you're in for a rare treat ... They do not really appeal to me, so I could not find a single thing to redeem this quirky tale. It sounds like something straight from the 1980s, a different era when this would have been straight into the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do the work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing to get involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her acting as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? They say the director was influenced by witnessing a near-rape and his work in documentaries, but even this is not an excuse for the bizarre scene in which a bunch of rural dogs beat Dyer. I do not think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can not understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in major independent British films in recent years. The Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What will independent British filmmakers do about their artistic judgment? It's a big stain on both your reputations. Listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of independent British movie fans crying in desperation?
