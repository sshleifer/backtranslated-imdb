"The Gentleman's Game" uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate a teenager's discovery of honesty, prejudice and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this movie was going, just to prove it was wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure the filmmakers knew where I was going either. The defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks "The Karate Kid" and unmasks any notion that he will become a mentor to the teenage golfer. It is refreshing, in a way, that this film refuses to follow most simplistic and overworked movie formulas. However, much of this still goes as planned. In fact, people give up all pretensions of civility, or fail to defend themselves from the things in which they believe, or are exposed to something far less respectable than their place in society presupposes. Unfortunately, there is often no resolution for those times. And except for the fact that the club serves as a backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or connection to them. Too bad the writers and director could not save a better movie, especially considering some of the talented actors and the potential in the editing.
