I checked this on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this terrible movie unfolds. every time you think it can not get worse, it inevitably happens. The acting is absolutely horrible. the plot does not make any sense. The title "Cold Revenge" on the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken at their first shot. There are many errors during the dialogues, indicating that there is no intention of making another attempt to at least try to make this film bearable. I do not remember seeing a worse movie and occasionally getting the bad ones - well, except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, as a bad, unstoppable deserves awards for Best Film at the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap.
