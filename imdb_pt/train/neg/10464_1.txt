This movie is not based on the bible. That leaves Christ completely out of the movie. They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ. Let yourself talk about it. Do not quote scriptures. The end of time is called the great tribulation. The movie does not even show the bad times. The seven bowls, seven vile and seven trumpets of judgments are summed up to a second cast of 15 seconds of the sea changing its structure. The anti-Christ was killed 3 Â½ years in the Tribulation and this is how the movie ended. The only part they agreed was that there were two prophets. They did not use the names of the course, because that would be very close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst part was that I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to get unsaved people to it. I feel the movie is bad. It's a fake like everything the devil does. I just hope this does not take away the next movie based on the books left behind. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is that it was bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and bad character development. I've seen better episodes of Miami Vice.
