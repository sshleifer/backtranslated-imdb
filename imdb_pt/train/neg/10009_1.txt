This movie is a load of giant pants. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his own bad script. And his direction is as comatose as it can be without him being a sleepwalker in the process. <br /> <br /> The worst, however, is Woody Harrelson, whom I usually like when he is properly chosen. He plays "the walker," a homosexual man in D.C. who makes social companionship to the bored wives of the Washington elite. It could not have been more one-dimensional if it had been cropped from a magazine and jumped in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. His "southern accent" is the "off the rack" version that descends from the beginning to the end of every line he offers, as if the heat and humidity of the south still drained him of all the energy he has. It is monotonous. But yours is not the worst accent in the movie. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to affect some sort of Middle Eastern accent that is so clumsy that he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. He is unable to roll his r's despite the fact that in real life he is German and speaks several languages ​​- being one of them Italian! That's a good reason to climb another person, do not you think? <br /> <br /> From history, to the script, to the direction, to the camera work, to the performances of the protagonists, this movie is bad from beginning to end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to get through this film with their dignity intact. In fact, all three are excellent, despite being stuck in a very bad movie. Unfortunately, no one could be good enough to rescue this endless series of failures. If you like these three actresses, watch them on something else. This movie is not worth your time.
