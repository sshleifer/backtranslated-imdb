"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of Dracula. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to scoop up the body and steal their blood for auction, it's an offer they can Hardly students are also relentlessly pursued by a vampire murderer from the Vatican! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is very common. are some good bloody effects as a very cool scene of double decapitation but there is enough violence for my liking. The movie becomes quickly tedious and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense. So if you like modern vampire movies, take a look. I prefer atmospheric chillers of vampires of the 60s and 70s, such as "Lips of Blood", "The Brides of Dracula" or "Lemmings: Supernatural Children's Tale", to name just a few.4 out of 10.
