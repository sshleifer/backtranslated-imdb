This was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community, something that would stand up and shout at the world media to take notice, as we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our choices in producing a good job with open source tools . After downloading the basic version (die hard fan here on a dial-up modem) eventually got here I hit my first hurdle. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp could not open it in my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffeine could not open it on my suse server. Mplayer was able to run it flawlessly. It will be difficult to spread the word about this if normal users can not even open it ... <br /> <br /> The movie. Beautiful soundtrack, superb lighting, masterful camera work and impeccable texturing. Everything seemed real. And then the two main characters moved ... and they spoke ... And the movie died for me. Everything besides the lip sync and real animation of the two main characters (except Proog in the dance scene) seemed fluid and totally alive. The two main characters were so excited that sometimes I wondered if there was any game on the market right now with cut-scenes that involved less realism than that. <br /> <br /> Any frame in the film is fantastic .. like a frame, and the thing is great if none of the actors is moving. I'm so glad I did not really recommend this to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy had a more insightful and ingenious plot. <br /> <br /> This movie would gain 10 stars were it not for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen.
