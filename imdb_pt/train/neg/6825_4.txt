Once the big action star who fell from the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent. Gathering with some former co-stars to clear the city. <br /> <br /> Low key, often to the point of softness, comedy "action" for the most part simply does not work. Part of the problem is the cast of Chris Klien as a former action hero. he's not bad, but he's not really believable as someone who was taken to be a tough guy. Like I said he's not bad, he's just just for what his back story is. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which really is not funny and seems artificial at times, and the direction that is pedestrian to the port of bluntness. There is no life in the way things are set up. It's as if the director had a list of photos and went through that list. This causes a film not involving. And yet, the film occasionally comes to life, as in the last show that ends the film. This sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the movie have failed with much of its power. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend the movie. It's worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or you're a big independent movie fan in all its forms, but otherwise this is just a disappointment.
