this movie has it all; the agile work of the camera, reminiscent of martin scorcese, or oliver stone, the strict performance of the "heat," the explosive action of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, the witty dialogue of a Tarantino script, and the epic feel of saying "the godfather" The character reinhold judge displays a fiery temperament, but also shows real depth and emotional intensity. his performance reminds me of the portrait of jake la motta by robert de niro in furious bull. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are truly breathtaking, not because bullit has a movie portrayed with scenes of high octane cars and style. Special effects take the limits of technology and cinema to their limits. Independence Day set the standard that this film clearly matched, and far exceeded. <br /> <br /> Overall, great acting out of a list cast (such as a guest list of oscars parties!), classy venues, thrilling action, and a tight script.
