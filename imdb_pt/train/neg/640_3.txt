Cold and alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about an army captain who returned from service in World War II with his faint memory (now there is an original idea!). It seems he remembers old Glenda Jackson, but not the current wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to trigger some emotional sparks. This extremely well-done soap brings together leader Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are all down. There are a handful of good scenes (particularly whenever Jackson is onscreen), but Bridges' rhythm is incredibly slow and the film's dull color is unnerving. On the shelf, this "Soldier" is best left forgotten. * 1/2 of ****
