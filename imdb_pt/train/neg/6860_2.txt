besides the fact that crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there. <br /> <br /> The characters basically do not make sense most of the time. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a real beginning, middle or The film begins with a young man, with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, apparently returning from a season in the army. <br /> <br /> He picks up a ride to a two-story house that is in awful condition with the windows closed. He enters the house, walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there. This scene succeeds, and we learn nothing more about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> You never explain exactly who this house is, or where the people went, but we get the impression that Hazel probably lived there at once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to a town. Why - we do not know. Once he arrives in this town, he writes a name and address that he sees on a bathroom wall, and goes to visit this woman, who is a surprisingly fat prostitute. He sees her for some time and then apparently he does not see her anymore. Like everything else in this movie, it sucks and nothing. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch tries to make friends with him, but Hazel is not really interested, although they continue to cross. Enoch is as crazy as you can. One of their habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are and talk to them in an insulting way. <br /> <br /> We never know why Enoch behaves like him, or why Hazel behaves like him, in addition to the fact that Hazel has an old-time overdose, frightening fundamentalist religion through her grandfather. Enoch later becomes enchanted with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit, and manages to get the gorilla to suit him and then runs through it. <br /> <br /> Hazel who is very tight and seems to be in a constant bordering fury does a bit of street preaching. I have the impression that he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been pierced in him. <br /> <br /> He has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never make any point, and there is no plot. <br /> <br /> Eventually Hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins to self-harm. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange movie. Interesting in its strangeness, but other than that, it has absolutely nothing in favor. <br /> <br /> The cast does an excellent job, but this film can not deliver a point of view or a plot. <Br /> <br /> The movie also has the characters playing around the N word from time to time without connection to the rest of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
