I read all the books Love Come Softly. Knowing very well that films can not use every aspect of the book, but usually have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed with this movie. The only thing they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy's father comes to visit him (although in the book both parents come). That is all. The plot was so distorted and very distant and, yes, sad, from the book, that I just could not appreciate it. Even though I did not read the book, it was very sad. I know the life of the Pioneers was difficult, but the whole movie was bad. The rating is to have the same family orientation as the movie that makes them great.
