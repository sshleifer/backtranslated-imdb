No way this movie is as bad as 'Perfect Stranger', but it was not funny. He could not stick to a kind of comedy - he jumped from the SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, to the romantic, to the big guy, to the comedy types "Loser" (the movie). Although there were some funny moments of clowning (the fall of the hill), no one was too funny or exceptional anyway. Schindler's List was funnier (and shorter). you never knew if Andy Samberg should be in high school, dropped out of college or just a loser living at home with his mother - Sissy Spacek in his worst choice of roles. And poor Ian McShane, the serious actor, if I had to just name one, is given the minimum to read on camera. The story drags on and is completely predictable until and including the end (there are no spoilers here if Adam Samberg's mother wants to see). Do not spend money to watch this movie, and maybe Lorne Michaels gets the tip and start producing quality movies (Yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy are of quality).
