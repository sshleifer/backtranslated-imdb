A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Children's Dream <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There's no escape from it. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character in all horror movies. But even being a fan, I can not help but see that this movie is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. By now they had just given up. They do not even try. They are producing the course, waiting for a few dollars easier. <br /> <br /> The story does not catch your eye. It is so simple that it is almost absent. <br /> <br /> Alice, a survivor of part 4 is pregnant. Freddy is coming back through the baby's dreams. In the beginning, we learned that to stop him, Alice needs to find her mother. And that's it. <br /> <br /> The story advances slowly, as there is such a small plot, which means that it gets pretty annoying after a few minutes of bad dialogues and horrible acting. In fact, that's the only scary thing to do, since the killings are not at all cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we could care less about them. <br /> <br /> Girls are as unattractive as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I've seen better actors in school plays. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring a little class for this. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material simply did not let it shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins' work is nowhere near the brilliant direction of Renny Harlin in Dream Master. He tries some imaginative scenes near the end, but the tension that Harlin and Craven have created so well in previous films is not where to find it. <br /> <br /> The Dream of the Child is just another unimaginable sequence. It's the kind of movie that gives the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end to the once scary Freddy. It's too sad to see you now. A clown who is not funny. A sick joke. Goodbye Freddy.
