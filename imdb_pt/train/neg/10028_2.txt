I had many expectations with regard to this film and even more since it was a Yashraj Film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy operates a call center and one day is invited by Pooja Singh to teach his boss, Lakhan Singh, English. . The two fall in love and decide to flee, but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can not do this because she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and it is only then that Jimmy discovers that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track down Jimmy and Pooja. Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the film is directed for the first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes! The setting is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much-publicized weight loss) looks good. But the storyline is extremely thin in the story and sometimes does not make sense from one scene to the next - hence why I said at the beginning that I expected more from this film because it was a Yashraj production. With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not a song that I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are times when you can laugh and this is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor did his part well. But that can not be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him like a villain. Lastly, it does not matter Aditya Chopra, who in the past produced and directed good films like "Mohabbatein," what Yash Chopra was doing in producing a junk-like movie? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, not worth wasting your time and this is my first and last impression.
