Another in a long line of movies made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the whole premise is presented in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates a whole facet of suspense. The only competent half-actor is killed 10 minutes in the movie, so we get idiot characters running around doing stupid things. Low-budget films can not afford expensive special effects, so the CGI portions are not surprisingly deadpan, but they were at least a valid attempt. The creature's costume is terrible, as seen when it falls on the sidewalk, and the director continues to emphasize the eyes, which are not even the red color shown in mirrored photos. The dialogue is awkward and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The latest action sequence takes place at a police station, also a Terminator cheat, with everyone hiding in the only glazed office where Darkwolf does not hit. In the end, the girl calls the hero a "good protector," but he gets both his partners, the original protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen police officers, all dead without a decent shot, despite an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun. But here's the real reason to write badly: they could have killed the beast shortly after the initial credits when she was holding the stripper while blinking her red eyes. Instead, they took him into custody?!?
