Well, I rented this movie and found out it really sucks. It's about this family with the stepmother and the same idiot family fights, so the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a picture of the damaged building and strange things and strange movie, and then he asks the father to take it, you go to the city that no one knows it exists (blah blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and you still do not know how to understand it what is this movie !!!! I've seen a lot of mystery movies, but this was the worst, honestly, it does not have a description at all and I wish I did not see it.
