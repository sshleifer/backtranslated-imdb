What is happening with the ITV drama? First, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst TV drama I've seen in years, and now "Perfect Parents" a complete disaster from start to finish. Whoever is responsible for commissioning this nonsense should be receiving P45 for special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most Drama / Thrillers, a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary for the plot to develop, but "Perfect Parents" took it to a new level, I have suspended so much belief in end of this nonsense that I felt I had been forced to feed a load of "magic mushrooms" was how the writers decided to try to create a "Drama by numbers" involving some serious subjects - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedofilia - the only problem was how the great Eric Morecambe once said playing a piano: "I'm playing the right notes, just not necessarily in the right order." For your next script, I suggest you try reading some more books on script development than "Script writing For Dummies". <br /> <br /> Due to the ridiculous Script and the total lack of Tension in the Direction, acting was suitably low key, not the fault of the actors as the cast was top notch. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this sad play instruct their agents the next time the Postman tries to deliver a script from ITV's Theater Department, make sure the mailbox is tightly closed!
