This time we hosted a psychopath toy maker called "Joe Petto" (understood?) That creates toys that villains kill people. He goes after the family that has the bad luck of simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son "Pino" (again, understood?) Used to live. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst (and hopefully [presumably] the latter) in this semi-series, this and the previous one look like softcore porn movies, but without sex and nudity. It's like a low-rent hybrid of "Halloween III," "Puppet Master," "Dolls," and bad home movies. Supposedly, in 2000, they began to make a sixth chapter in the series, but it was abandoned and never completed. We can all just hope it stays like this ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 a star out of **** <br /> <br />
