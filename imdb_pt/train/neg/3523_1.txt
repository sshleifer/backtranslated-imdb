Oh, what a bad, bad, really bad movie! Cowritten and starring Sylvester Stallone - this should have been enough - and with many scenes of climbing, vertigo, fall and villains chewing the scene and a badly made air assault. There are two tangles, both of them lame. One involves a failed traumatic rescue, and the other involves evil people destroying an airplane for the sack and killing several harmless people whenever possible. The generally trusted John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer magnitude of the product, is reduced to mocking and calling those he does not care for "Bostid!" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was energetic and enigmatic when she played Maggie at the Northern Exposure, is sadly lost on the part of a rescue mountaineer and pilot. Stallone is impassive and muscular. No immortal line in this. No live lines either.
