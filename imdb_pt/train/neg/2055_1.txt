There is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this "movie". The original said everything and still holds. Either read the book or do some research on the story, and you'll realize that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? Your sister could have done a better job! Having been to Holcomb & Edgerton, KS, where the story goes, the scenery and locations did not look like NOTHING like Kansas. The original is fascinating, from the filming location to the use of participants, weapons and real belongings of the victims. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and Cinematography by Conrad Hall ... The original is available on widescreen DVD now. Let this turkey die a quick death.
