I'm a fan of the series and read all 7 books. I wanted to see it just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who should watch this are those who have read the series and are curious about it. It is very bad, and you will disconnect from reading them. Do not be mean, but Lucy is so ugly that it slows down the movie. Was she the daughter of the directors? Seriously, I'm sure the movie beavers were jealous of their teeth. She had an overbite that would embarrass any beaver. The film loses so much in translation. CS books do not translate as easily as Tolkein's books, or even Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did right! Aslan! Well done. Although the other human actors with painted faces (beavers, wolves) look silly, Aslan was very well done, since he was not just a human actor walking around. (I think it's like that old custome horse? 2 people inside?) Also, I would be curious what kids think of this movie. Maybe they like it? But as for adults, bet safe that they do not like, even if it is a fan of CS.
