The problem with family dramas is that outside of TV movies on placements like Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them. And those who are observed tend to be sensationalists and current or current issues or issues in the news (or recent news). Movies that explain or exploit the human condition are not popular. Particularly with the young audience who would be the fan base of Miss Lohan or the younger audience who tends to make films not only popular but financially successful for the studios. <br /> <br /> The specific problems I had with this movie are the cartoon of some of the characterizations. It was a bit much to blame for all of Lohan's characters (destroying the car, using drugs, etc.) with what her stepfather did to her. While not unlikely, it's a bit too much to expect the public to swallow. In addition, other aspects, such as the fact that she gives the young Morman, oral sex, or that she really would be a good vet assistant, who coincidentally has something for her mother, etc., all these elements do not really help this movie. He placed her more in the element of a situation comedy, experiencing one of his "special dramatic episodes" than for a well-made and well-written feature. <br /> <br /> When you watch the DVD and hear the comment, especially for the various alternate endings, you can actually see all that is sharp focus.
