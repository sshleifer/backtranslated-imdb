A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the lead roles, talking in false accents and emphasizing the old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and earth are the best things for men. They are seen as property and investment. Because it's a big-budget movie, in which many extras cooperate, big sets are built and special effects happen, filmmakers could not risk hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Oscar for this performance, which is definitely the worst of the film. Her unchanging face builds a barrier between her and the audience. O-Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance by showing off his talents again. Another problem with the film is the ending. It seems Franklin did not know when to finish the picture. This film can be dangerous if it is considered an example of Chinese culture and traditions.
