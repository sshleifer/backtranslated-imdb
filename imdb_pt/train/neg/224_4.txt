The worst thing about Crush is not that he has acted very badly, or that the plot is virtually nonexistent, and it is not so bad that camera work could have been better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part of this movie is that it has some absolutely brilliant moments that keep you waiting for more to come. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and cheap scenes of over 40 women crying, cuddling and talking about babies and marriage - so please do not miss out. <br /> <br /> I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a horrible time. The few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting my time. <br /> <br />
