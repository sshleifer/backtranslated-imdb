I watched this movie as a preview of an art exhibition by Matthew Barney. He certainly prepared me. I almost skipped exposure and, in retrospect, probably should have. <br /> <br /> Besides the punctuation being great (Bj√∂rk) and the rich and colorful photography, the content was mostly tedious and predictable. Hell, I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to find out what the pearl divers were doing. The film was basically a silly blend of Japanese cultural references and industrial images of modern whaling technology being used in a simulated poaching / harvesting. The film "Peaks" with enough shock-free art to turn your stomach. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of the movie? While others may argue that it is an anti-whaling piece, it can be argued that it somehow also warrants whaling. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "show" the public with his anal fetish, fecal, self-mutilation, and cannibalism. <br /> <br /> In short, unless you really get along with Barney's sense of art, do not worry about watching this movie. The message is obscure, the pace slow and the pretentious cultural references. If you're after the art of shock, you'll do better in one of the many "Undead" movies or hunt down an old copy of Hustler and catch a fecal drawing.
