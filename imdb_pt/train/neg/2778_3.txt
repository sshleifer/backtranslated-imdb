This movie seemed to have everything with good camera, sound, movies, scenery, music, costumes ... but drum-roll, Gary Stretch said! I do not know if it was your poor performance or just a bad script, but I'd say it was both. Considering his cast in that role, I found it difficult to hope for him to the end. I wish he had died in battle or in one of the fights between swords and knives. <br /> <br /> So the bin for the conspiracy to kill the king was because the king did not have dinner and had sex with him. Queen? Very lame. And go to the extreme to kill your own child? And then push her lover as the king's successor? I see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes, but the way all this was presented was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I do not recognize Gary Stretch of anything else, but he was terrible. I read another user's comments about the audio being dubbed, but I do not think it was dubbed ... after all, he speaks English, right? It was really awful. The lines were read right on top of the coroner's desk ... straight line. It may be that he simply does not have the voice to carry the pitch fluctuations. <br /> <br /> In addition, I watched until the end, so the movie had at least one "interest". It could have been more if the script / lines and the cast had given more work. The setting and the film crew along with very good quality film is what really made this film above all else. The cast and story were all secondary. I give the film crew a 10.
