The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever did it can make a sequel. From beginning to end "The Tooth Fairy" was simply terrible. It looked like a malicious childish movie that got confused, with a wizard of "Wizard of Oz" melting and jolly boys ending up combined with some bad effects and swearing. <br /> <br /> Half of the cast seems completely unnecessary. except for being conveniently there to be murdered in some way. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise, the auras reader and Mme. McDonald's, have no point in the film - they could have them included in the main plot for some interesting stories, but apparently could not be bothered. People who watch the movie know that the characters are there for a bloody death scene, but at least TRY and have a little plot for them. The story is generally weak with the characters' erratic behavior that makes you wish everyone to be eaten by the witch. <br /> <br /> Add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden). film ends with a complete failure. If only MST3K could have gone in ...
