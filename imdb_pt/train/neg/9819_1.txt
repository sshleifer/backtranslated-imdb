I read the other review on this movie, and I usually try not to be harsh on my criticism because I try to be a cool person. However, this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and this is overcoming a lot of badly US Network plus Cinemax nights). Whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from ever making another. This movie disgusted me in a way no other film ever did. I really think these people are crazy. Just save time and do not watch this movie. Please - I wish I had. The acting is horrible, the plot (which plot) is stupid and demeaning and insane. I really do not think this should have been turned into a movie. But that's my opinion, and I'm trying to keep you from wasting your time.
