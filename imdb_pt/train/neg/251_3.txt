I was soooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented and cuddled to enjoy a classic vacation story that appeared on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This movie has come out of the book more often than it is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but in that, it seemed that he was totally in character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was completely flat. <br /> <br /> I realized that this was done in 84, pre-CG effects for the most part. But it seemed to have a very good quality in film B, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Christmas Spirit Spirit takes Scrooge on the fast tour of the world, watching people in the darkest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmas. <br /> <br /> I'll admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "Scrooge" reformed at the end. That was a refreshing picture. <br /> <br /> I wish Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a bit more ragged and treacherous. And Tiny Tim ... oh, do not even get me started with bad kids ...
