I'm ashamed to be writing this comment. I say this because those of you who are reading will know that I have gone through everything and that it is embarrassing to admit even to strangers. But I just had to warn those who read the comments of the viewers about the IMDb before watching a movie not to watch this. It's the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is goofy. The acting is amateur. And the direction, the work of the camera, the scenery, the costumes, etc. They are all second-rate. Let it go.
