THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most over-direct, over-the-top, over-all-mess I've ever seen leaving France. There is nothing worse than a French production trying to make films made in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of such a horror / action / friend movie. I almost stopped halfway because I knew I would be nothing more than Frenchmen trying to show off. <br /> <br /> The movie starts promising, as a kind of horror movie, but quickly changes genre, from horror to action, to x-files type, to buddy flick, which in the end, CR is everything and also none of this. It's so full of cliches that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogue and those silent pauses, with fades and disappearances in the right moments, made me moan. I thought that only Hollywood movies used this banal technique. <br /> <br /> The chase scene, with Vincent Cassel running after the killer, is so overrated and overrated that it's almost a thing of beauty. The climax at the top of the mountain, with the stupid revelation about the killer with Cassel and Reno playing "friends" like Nolte and Murphy at 48 HRS, completely derailed what little credibility the film had until then. <br /> <It is hard to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA, which despite having its share of problems, does not even come close to the horror of this confusing and overloaded movie.
