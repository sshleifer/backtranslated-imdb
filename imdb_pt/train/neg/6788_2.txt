The idea of ​​On behalf of the people is good, a murderer does not want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl that he killed to take care of his daughter. And you can expect the actors, especially Scott Bakula, to do some good acting, but unfortunately not! On behalf of the people turns out to be the regular tearjerker Friday night. The flashbacks with the girl who was killed are pretty pathetic and at one point you can just predict what the actors are going to say ... If you want to watch a good movie about it then watch Dean Man Walking!
