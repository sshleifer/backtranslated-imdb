This movie on paper looked like it could be good, after watching though I realized that this movie was completely terrible! The plot has no meaning, and I think I counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes, each making the movie more annoying and ridiculous. I watched this late night pitch no noise at all just to add to his SCARINESS but the truth is that the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, they play opera I want to be serious! ! This movie epitomizes all that is not good in this kind of movie. To be honest, do not say anything else, but see at your own risk this movie is just a complete trash, ENJOY !!
