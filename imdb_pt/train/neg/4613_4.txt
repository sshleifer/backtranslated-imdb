Well, then what is this?! I found Nicholson's character superficial and, unfortunately, uninteresting. The character of Angelica Huston drained my power. And Kathleen Turner is a filthy and not a good bitch. It's not that I "did not understand". It's not that I do not think some of the ideas could have led to anything else. This is a film with nothing but the notion that we should accept these ideas, and that's what the movie has for it. That Nicholson falls in love with Turner is absurd, but, again, pretends to be so. However, this does not strike me as one.) Funny, or b) ... even remotely interesting !!! This was a waste of my time, so do not let the hype get the best of you ... it's a waste of your time! With all that was said, the opening church sequence is very beautiful ...
