"Mestra da Arte" Celeste works as an agent for the London branch of Interpol's Bureau 17, specializing in (I think) hidden criminals. She has the Eye of Destiny, good in her hands, dangerous if anyone can. <br /> <br /> Bureau 17 caught up with a California Satanist, Hyde (unrelated to Dr. Jekyll). Detective Lucy Lutz, of the Los Angeles police, flies to England to bring him back to the United States. Lutz is the connection to previous Witchcraft films, having been played by Stephanie Beaton before in Witchcraft 9. In part 7, Lutz was played by another woman; at 6, Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> Lutz's part at 9 was not very big, but she is one of the main stars of this. Although she has left behind her high heels and short skirts, she still has revealing tops on this. And this time she has scenes of nudity and sex. Beaton is quite attractive on paper. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a lot of sex scenes. An anonymous club-goer has a fatal trio with two vampires, the Satanist and the chief vampire do it with some twist, Lutz meets an English friend, and Celeste and her boyfriend make love. The recurring main character of The Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this, although Lutz mentions it to Bureau 17 agent Dixon in a conversation about vampires. She also calls her partner, Detective Garner (parts 6, 7 and 9), although we have not heard the end of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde is trapped by a group of vampires led by Raven. , for a Walpurgis ritual to have something to do with a god named Morsheba (I think). Hyde offers all its lines in a very flat manner, while Raven excels to an exaggerated degree. The fight scenes are terribly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The audio of the movie was very badly recorded and poorly edited. In addition, some dialogues are lost with music or strident sirens. The photograph is not great either. Having the film set and actually filmed in the UK was a novelty, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is very good as Celeste; attractive, certainly, but more importantly, she is easily the best actress in the film (despite the bad fight scenes). I'm surprised that her filmography is so small. If there is an XIV Witchcraft, and I bet there will be, they should bring it back, even if it means taking it to California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available alone, or on the Hotter Than Hell Collection DVD along with Witchcraft XI and two unrelated movies.
