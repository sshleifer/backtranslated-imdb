The first 30 minutes of the movie were agitated and difficult to know what was happening (unless you read the book - which I did not have). <br /> <br /> If you can stick with the first semester, the second semester is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet nonetheless. <br /> <br /> The way it was filmed would be to think that it was produced in the early 80's, not in 2005. <br /> <br /> There are no highlights, bland, but moved on without boring me. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton selected this role, his part would have been better conjured up with one more player at the level of the other actors to maintain the balance.
