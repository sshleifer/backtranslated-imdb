This movie looked like it was going to be really funny. I was very excited to see it, but I was very disappointed. It was very unrealistic. The plot was also quite weak. I was hoping it was very funny, but the jokes were not so good. I was also very disappointed with the ending. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
