The immortal was interesting. It certainly did not kill me for its duration of an hour and a half, but it also did not impress me much. A group of children is kidnapped in an alley by mutant muscleheads (in a scene that features the least convincing head-crushing sound effect of the cinema) and taken to a chic home in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for their wealthy elderly patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly redone with a big budget a few years later, like FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant the brain of an elderly person into a different body, the new voice will sound just like the old voice? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a bright green serum, you can almost see visions of BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the heads of the producers. But production literally does not have the guts to do it. I never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror movie, they do not put it on the edge of the picture with blood. The performance is uniformly appalling, with only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as an assistant to Dr. Price. He has a good evil laugh. The only other noteworthy thing about THE IMMOBILIZER is that it features many seniors doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious problems for the old.
