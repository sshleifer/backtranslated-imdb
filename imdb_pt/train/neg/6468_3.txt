It's a good thing that The Score came to Marlon Brando as a farewell performance because I would hate to think of him coming out for free money. Not what his fans should remember him. <br /> <br /> In recent years, Brando is more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of movie that Welles would have done looking for funding his own work. Brando is the director of a local jail that, in the United States, when located in a small rural setting, is usually the largest employer in the region. This gives the one in charge a lot of influence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has a weakness that he practices, his two twin bimbas, also known as daughters. Even when they are simultaneously pregnant with a pair of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to their father. <br /> <br /> Do not fear because Brando is willing to give them jobs in prison where they work. under conditions not much better than the condemned. What to do but commit a robbery of a train that runs through the locality from time to time carrying money used to be burned by the Treasury. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has a few moments of humor, most of the time it is well below the talents of everyone involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also an FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and the rest of the cast began working with someone whom many consider to be the greatest American actor of the last century. If it were not for Brando's presence and if it was 40 years earlier, Free Money would be playing on the drive-in circuit in the red state of America where people could see how it's being satirized. <br /> <br /> Or weak attempt is made to lampoon them.
