There are so many misstatements in this so-called "documentary" that I saw myself screaming on television. Bart Sibrel may be able to produce a flashy DVD, but unfortunately he is without looking at the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> He trusts to be inaccurate, do not tell the whole story, or the old favorite "the government always lies to us" innuendo, and people believe in what they are told and do not check the accuracy or details behind the claims. <br /> <br /> In addition, your "exclusive" or "unreleased" images are available for free on the Internet on a number of websites. <br /> <br /> Read about the circumstances surrounding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to get interviews, and used creative editing of the answers to promote his own opinions. <br /> <br /> All allegations made by Mr. Sibrel about "inaccuracies," "mistakes" or "denunciations" in the Apollo program were thorough How can I get the 40 minutes of my life back?
