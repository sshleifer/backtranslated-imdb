This review is based on the Shock-o-Rama video, released in 2002 in an undeserved world. How bad is it? It's horrible, what a '1' stands for on the IMDb scale - but it's much worse than that. It's good to imagine that an original German version could make things better - comic dubbing in English is not funny at all - but honestly, it's one of the worst amateur movies of any genre you'll probably see. The zombies in the movie are slow and clumsy as ever, and they do not seem to have the ability to speak or think of anything beyond their next meal. However, they are also smart enough to operate chain saws and are mischievous enough to know that Western taboos on genitalia will no doubt liven up the conversation at the dinner table. George Romero's Land of the Dead posited a zombie nation that retained an ounce of social coherence; here the zombies are nothing more than an empty screen for the wicked imaginations of director Andreas Schnaas. Completely without redeeming social value, and even worse, totally devoid of entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bland joke for anyone who wastes money.
