This has to be the worst, and I mean the worst biker movie ever made! And that's saying a lot because the stinking queue is long and smelly! <br /> <br /> Now, at least, we know what happened to Ginger after she was rescued from Gilligan Island! A frightened Tina Louise (she was probably afraid someone would see this mess!) He's a stranded driver who is plagued by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in movie history. But do not worry about the fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a city doctor comes to the rescue! War prisioner! The sudden passion! Bang! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this "bomb" is some cute women, some laughable fighting scenes and the still sexy Tina Louise!
