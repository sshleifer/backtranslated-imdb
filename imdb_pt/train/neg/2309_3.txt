I have a high tolerance for the stranger, but frankly some movies go far beyond strangers - so far they make your brain hurt. This is a movie like that. Trying to understand or even explain it is impossible and I think the film is best understood while using drugs - it's incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a very cute Japanese animation involving a cat. However, out of nowhere, tons of distorted and occasionally disturbing things occur - making me wonder if I'm missing something in the translation. However, even if this is so, why do we need to be treated with images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with an intelligent, defecating, vomiting, lighting animals on fire, etc. All this really seemed random and horrible. Strangely, and I do not know why, some see it as a work of genius. I just do not understand it.
