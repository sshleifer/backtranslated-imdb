When I first appeared in Happy Birthday to Me, I checked the timer to see how long the movie was. I was amazed at the length. Both animated and horror films share one point in common: the attention time of the selected audience, which should be on the right or around 90 minutes. Anything else, and you will lose most of your audience. <br /> <br /> This 110 minutes, or 20 minutes after its heyday was a big problem for me. I'd like to say that half of that movie could have been edited, but I'd be too generous to say that. Go ahead and see it and tell me how many scenes could have been edited, even without being an important movie. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the lengthy visit, the film was below mediocre. He spent all his time trying to be this huge mystery about which of the "elite 10" is killing the remaining friends. Most of the time, they not only surpass him, but they also bring the face closer and say, "It's this guy! No! It's that girl!" You'll spend more time with the camera fooling you than actually enjoying the movie. And do not make me start acting. <br /> <br /> Okay, that got me started. I had to laugh at the beginning trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played the character who went blind in Little House on the Prairie (later, the research proved my suspicions were correct) because throughout this movie, she really seemed blind. Strange, as a consecrated actress, she should have been the best of the group, but ended up being the worst. The rest of the team besides Ann (Bregman) was also very bad, but she took the cake. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a group of ten friends, and one is immediately killed. out. Almost no one thinks twice about the disappearance of this "dear" friend, so they continue on their merry way. Slowly, then more quickly, there are revelations about Virginia (Anderson), the main character, Past and her psychologist, who is a little more personal (AND CALL 24/7, apparently) than most shrink. All the time, more and more deaths happen. <br /> <br /> What is funny is that, like the first "disappearance", the "best friends" disappear, the rest does not care. Of course, they give a few seconds of time on the air to say "Wow, (that person) just would not run away" etc, but they are back to their sexual forms. And by the way, it's probably due to the awful script, or maybe I was losing interest at 30 minutes, but it was really hard to keep up with whoever liked the group, because everyone seemed to be the other's sex partners or someone would get scared the MAX by another and best friends in the next scene. SEE: the scary guy who kept a mouse / mouse in his pocket? literally ?? and was the most obvious suspect. I'm giving a lot of credit to the movie (and time), but as it became part of the "elite 10" I'll never know. <br /> <br /> But, I disagree, there is a mystery here. Why are these kids targeted? Why is Virginia thinking she killed someone, when it was never proven (to the very end) that any of them were really slaughtered? And why did the trailer and the poster say these murders are "Six of the most bizarre murders you'll ever see"? Hell, even for 1981, most of them were shown in any of the first two films on Friday the 13th? coincidentally, Friday the 13th part 2 was released 2 weeks for the happy birthday day for me. Maybe, they're talking about when they filmed months before, but they were late for the, well, party. <br /> <br /> When the "secrets" are revealed, trust me, you'll have to go back 3 -4x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives, and even then, put the captions to get all the words grumbling victim / killer. Even if you're the first time, it's an incredibly outrageous and hilarious ending. It's almost worth watching the whole movie again, but as a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This anniversary gathering should be avoided. Is it a first draft that is horrible and illogical? Please, please know that it takes several rewrites before the role of the camera as it contains any form of action or extreme over-action and is 100% unrealistic in how people react in extraordinary circumstances. <br /> <br /> Note: When I was a child, or say 10-11 years old, I loved horror movies. (Still, strangely, definite guilty pleasures, but they are getting harder and harder to watch over the years.) We got our first VCR, and recorded so many horror movies on TV (or EDITORS EDITORS). All I remember from Happy Birthday to Me is picking up the last 10 minutes on tape, which scared me to death ?? and obviously gave the great mystery about who the killer was. Even though I've seen other clips from this movie, I think this is the first full display I've had. Luckily, this horrible movie did not hurt me as a kid. I'm older now and I can get this crap. But never again. <br /> <br /> Note 2: That said, that crazy "Happy Birthday to Me" song, played on the final credits (and like a trail along), still frightens me tremendously. I think this movie (or last few minutes) had an influence on my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
