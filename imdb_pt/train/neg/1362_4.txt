Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a not very enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> The film shows the promise of Ustinov being released from jail for misappropriation. He convinces Robert Morley to leave to take over his identity and start hacking into a very fancy company run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart, another unusual pair for movies. Morley sounds just like he did in Marie Antoinette in 1938. Maybe he needed to go back to that genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous at best. Hard to believe that the following year, Maggie Smith completely changed her moods and gave a spectacular Oscar performance in "The First of Miss Jean Brodie." <br /> <br /> Ms. Smith is made here to be an apparent redhead, but at the end of the movie, she is the brains of the outfit. Too bad that writing was not the way with her.
