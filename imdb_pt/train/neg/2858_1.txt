This has to be one of the worst movies of all time. The graphics were horrendous, the acting was b-movie type and the effects were simple for the Nintendo 64. You'd think they'd put a little more effort into it. Of course, it's a Scifi Channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate, but this one takes the cake. Hell, I'm still laughing. So, like a movie of disbelief, this one does well. <br /> <br /> Although it seems to have some "known" actors and actresses in this, it is difficult for me to believe that they do not realize that the quality of this film was worth their time and effort. <br /> <br /> The graphics may have been good in the 60's or even the 70's, but come on, that's 2009! I will not give spoilers, let's just say that if you've ever played "Jurassic Park" on the Nintendo 64 you'll be well acquainted with what you see in this movie <br /> <br /> It's definitely not worth the 2 hours it took to sit through the thing
