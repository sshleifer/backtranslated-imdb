This movie is a poor attempt to make the original fans feel complete. The only thing people forget is the fact that the reason the original gained such acclaim was strictly to do with the fact that it should make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the bathroom. I'm not a negative kind of guy, but the man acting in this movie is .... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and I regret to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this film. I still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion on this.
