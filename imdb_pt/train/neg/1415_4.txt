I had high expectations for this indie having read the many positive reviews. So ... <br /> <br /> Here are my additional 'two cents' for the already published, excellent 'lost in translation' review. Premise: Morgan is "stuck" in a dusty little town, where he meets Scarlet, who works at the local supermarket. Can Morgan help raise the adorable Scarlet from his junk life in the trailer? <br /> <br /> Realistic dialogue? DO NOT. How about shopping at Target? First, Freeman looks into Target's interior as if he had entered Harrods. So he is tossed into a T-shirt rack, confirming that he has NEVER been to any store visited by the lovely Scarlet. Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as gay in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> A critic liked the fighting scene of Scarlet and ex-husband in their survival, a car in this case requires her to physically attack her ex-hubbie. Freeman runs into his defense ... naw ... he is cowering in disbelief and totally unable to deal with such a blunt aspect of his real life, very sad. <br /> <br /> Freeman's character believes that a car wash and a new and very revealing blouse are the key to Scarlet's job interview. Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS. Freeman's endless 'stage talk', where all aspects of Scarlet's reality are reduced to one or another stage related to Freeman's experience, was annoying. Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she sees in front of her: no education, no skills or white collar experience, MUCH POOR, no family support and a life of low self-esteem. Scarlet learns these life lessons with Freeman: some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt and a revealing blouse can open doors instead of their lack of education and professional skills. In the end, Freeman offers Scarlet little more than a strange distraction with a "star", not even paying gasoline so that the night of Scarlet returns to its life unchanged in a city whose name Freeman worries in not knowing.
