The actors did a great job in their roles - particularly the mother. However, as the film progressed, I discovered that I was watching more for its acting and not because I cared less about people. And sometimes I felt irritated by the irresponsible and disinterested approach of parenting exhibited again and again. The daughter is a superficial skank of 17 whose main ambition in life is to lie down with famous men and become a dancing nyphette (complete with many "espadotim"). The son is a guy with low self-esteem who seems very desperate for a relationship and friends - so much so that he throws a drug party at the end of the movie. Husband and wife are bored, but instead of putting energy into their obsolete relationship, they prefer to seek new partners (although the wife chooses badly, as the man she "gets" is gay --- OOPS!). I felt ALL the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time taking care of such shallow idiots. I think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the absolute banality and emptiness of the capitalist system. However, since these characters are not typical of the average Western family, it seems untrue.
