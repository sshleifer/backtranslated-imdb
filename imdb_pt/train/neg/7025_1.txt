I'd like to give a zero to this movie, or even lower, because, unfortunately, that's what it deserves. I honestly never leave a movie, but this one was so horribly horrible that I could not stand another minute of it. Please, please, please mankind, skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie where you can really go deeper, that's not it. <br /> <br /> It has unattractive, unpleasant leads, choppy structure, ridiculous dialogues, and is utterly unconvincing in every way imaginable. . At an absolutely basic level, you can not entertain. All about "Mango Kiss" is so exaggerated, it's WORSE than any student movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, the whole movie depends on a constant voice (and I mean CONSTANT) about the narration. The screenwriter may well have written a novel, because they insisted on saying it all instead of showing it. We are supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are best friends and have a special connection, even if there is no character development to illustrate this. In addition, this movie continues to introduce new characters after the first five minutes, not in a natural way, but in a frozen image of the characters with their name written on the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any of the characters. We really do not know any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am a gay woman, who watched this movie with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both find this movie a depressing representation of queer cinema. I'm beginning to think that gay and lesbian films are a lot like Christian rock - no matter how heinous it is, people will still join in and defend it, no matter how poor quality is. Please do not rent this !! Instead, we will encourage the production of gay and lesbian movies of QUALITY by renting "But I'm a cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures" instead of swallowing whatever nonsense they target the gay community (ie Queer as Folk).
