What ends up killing this film is its self-consciousness, among other things. here is a short list: 1. irreverent behavior. when the Beatles approached and injected their "peculiar and irreverent" brand of behavior / humor, they were greeted like new. this was more than 4 decades ago. get over it. <br /> <br /> 2. false sophistication. spitting bases, quasi-socio-political-isms, is a difficult terrain to work comically. ask Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> 3. the postmodern "I am hard in this false world and yes, I recognize myself" snake eating - used as an illustration with another animal in the movie itself! - It's such a retread. <br /> <br /> 4. Snobbish and presumptuous drug. <br /> <br /> 5. Amateur writing, acting, directing ... movies of students already seen? a victim of herself, the only thing I can say positive is that at least she has a sense of herself, and now I'm getting involved in the self-reflexive thing she thinks is worthwhile. but for ... what? in the final analysis, it sounds as hollow as any other pretentious piece - hey, I've seen woody allen take on the bergman, ie: "interiors" ??? well, it just makes it more amateurish.
