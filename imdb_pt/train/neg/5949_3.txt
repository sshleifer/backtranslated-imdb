It's not uncommon to see American reruns of foreign films falling flat on the floor, but here's the other side! This is a horrible reprint of the American film "Wide Awake" by the British! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is weird but fun and fun! "Liam", on the other hand, is just weird. I must credit "Liam" for one thing, and that's making it clear that I made the right choice in changing my religion!
