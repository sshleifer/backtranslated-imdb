This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is an end-of-the-80s movie about a seriously quiet kid's ability to play video games and walk during opening credits. Wiz is an unnecessary upgrade to The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that guy who collected 100 straws and had a little drink to drink. <br /> <br /> Now that we've got it all out of the way, let me just say this: there's really no reason to see this movie. It's simply a 100-minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the loosest sense possible, because it looks like this movie was written in a late week by a crack team of people who had never played Nintendo, and run a man with less sense of style than my grandmother. Maybe if the writer and director sat down and actually did some games together, they would realize they were about to film the total trash and instead go to vocational school to learn how to install car stereos. <br /> <br /> I hope this has been an enlightening experience for you. It certainly has not been for me. In fact, I think I might have lost some brainstells in watching this movie and writing about it. Next time you're in the store and you see The Wiz, the Wizard and the Wizard of Oz all sitting on the shelf in a beautiful row, give them all a foul and play Duck Hunt instead.
