Returning to Cabin by the Lake does not compare to the original. With just one main character (Stanley) returning to the sequel, the movie is not even worth the 2 hours of your time. I am a big fan of the first movie, the plot and acting was very good but this is a movie that I will never watch again. It's basically the same as the sequences of Urban Legends and Blair Witch were, but with a much worse performance. I've personally seen better acting in soap operas, it's so unfortunate that you just have to laugh. I, in no way recommend this movie to anyone, noting that it will only harm the first.
