I was so disappointed with this movie. I do not know much about the true story, so I was eager to see it in the movies and teach me about a small slice of history. With such a powerful story and great actors, it seemed an infallible combination. Well, somewhere the script failed. It was so scattered - is this movie about your childhood? your love life? your own disability? your ability to speak? your passion for the disabled? I'm sure there's a way to incorporate all these things into a good story, but this movie was not it. I was left watching cold characters that were unpleasant not because of their shortcomings, but because of their personalities. Other minor complaints: 1. The heavy soundtrack. It's the Seventies - WE ALREADY RECEIVE! 2. If he is such a phenomenal public speaker, why have not we been treated with more than one stretch here and there-and still, especially in montages?
