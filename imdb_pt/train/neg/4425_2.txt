A movie about Harlem Renaissance and a particular author. This contrasts with a modern story about a young, gay, and black artist. <br /> <br /> If this seems vague, it is because the movie itself is. It is well run, fairly well written and (mostly) well-acted. In addition, the scenes in the past are filmed in moody black and white. In addition, this is one of the few movies dealing with gay men who do not shy away from the sex scenes (not so explicit and not frontal). Still, I hated it mainly. <br /> <br /> The movie snakes all over the place, is full of nasty characters (including the main character) and (this is the killer) moves in a rhythm of slugs. Three times I thought about leaving the theater because I was so bored. But the director was there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His talk afterwards shows that it was a labor of love and it took 6 years to complete. I really wish I could enjoy it more (there are MANY movies dealing honestly with gay blacks), but I can not. Unless you're very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there's no reason to see it.
