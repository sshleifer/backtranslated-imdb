This is a hybrid creature born in the mind of Carl Macek. With Robotech the second generation (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23 in a miserable movie, that has no logic! The story is very, very bad, and you can not forgive the action of Megazone when it has nothing to do with Robotech. If this movie has such a high rank it is for the TV series and not for itself! I said this, the name can not save it!
