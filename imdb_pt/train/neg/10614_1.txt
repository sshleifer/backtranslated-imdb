This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some movies. It's past like an art film, but it's really a piece of crap. It's a redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dance, but that can not make up for Sally Potter's disgusting and obvious homage to herself. The plot of this movie is non-existent, and I guarantee you'll start laughing until the end. Especially where she starts to sing. It's absolutely unreal.
