This film masquerades as a social commentary, when in fact it is as ridiculous as the very racism it condemns. The premise of this film: African-American = strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is when Rapaport pulls a gun at Omar Epps and a Jew. The Jew stereotypically collapses in fear and begins begging for his life ... but the great, strong and challenging Omar Epps remains strong without fear. We also have the condemnation of each member of the fraternity as being an arrogant drunken preppie or rapist. The raped white girl, of course, begins to consider lesbianism, since she is just a weak white girl. When the white nerdy guy is rejected by the members of the fraternity, it is clear that he should fit in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards; especially the muscular guy who is quickly shot down by strong black men. Wait ... BUSH RHYMES HIT A FACE TWICE SIZE ??? Yes of course. <br /> <br /> Of course blacks NEVER reject their own people and Omar Epps easily enters with them. The scenes in which Ice Cube threatens his white roommates and keep them in line are simply stupid - of course he is the dominant while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and end up moving. This movie was just terrible and the end made me really laugh out loud. The overly long slow camera between Epps and Banks gets hilarious with the faces they make - it's like watching my nephew and cousins ​​grimacing at each other (and they're all under 5). Do yourself a favor and skip that crap.
