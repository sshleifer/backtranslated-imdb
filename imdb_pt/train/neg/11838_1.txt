If your idea of ​​entertainment is to watch graphic images of people being hit by cars (you can see a woman passing under the front wheel, being twisted when the car passes through it before entering under the rear wheel - and show two sometimes if you missed the first time) then this is the documentary for you. I admit I did not see this disturbing part of voyeurism anymore, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take for television networks to start showing movies. Maybe gaming programs based on self-mutilation might be good. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen. I do not need to see proof on TV disguised as entertainment.
