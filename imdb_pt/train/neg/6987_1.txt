I'm all for the idea of ​​a great American Revolutionary War epic. This is not it. (And also was not Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT.But I digress.) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in an advertising exhibit at the former MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out. The audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by the esteemed Hugh Hudson (of CHARIOTS OF FIRE), and starring Al Pacino. <br /> <br /> But it did not take long for people to start squirming in their seats, whispering ironic remarks about Pacino's terribly misunderstood accent - he should be an American of Scottish descent (!) - and the Nastassja Kinski, who should have recently emigrated from England (!!). Then the story began and everything collapsed quickly. <br /> <br /> The motives were confusing, the dialogue was atrocious, the events had no historical or political context. What was about a plot advanced in absurd coincidence; for the second or third time that supposed lovers Pacino and Kinski met, this became a joke in bad taste. Donald Sutherland gave an unbalanced performance as British officer / pederast. His accent was all over the map, too. I do not think there were any English actors available. <br /> <br /> Many people have left. Those who stayed tried to stifle their laughter, then giggled openly. I held on - I realized that at least the battle scenes could be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably, Hudson chose to film them with handheld cameras, not even Steadicam, the idiocy giving an "authenticity" to the wrong news that ruined the sense of scale. <br /> <br /> There was a semi-famous TV critic in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (the deceased) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could tell he was annoyed at the behavior of the rest of us. And sure enough, on his TV segment the next day he gave the film a '10 'in his notorious' Franklin Scale' from 1 to 10, while commenting rudely about the madmen who had stopped the show the night before, who clearly did not I know art when they see it. What a clown. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino has not starred in another movie for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career has never bounced back. You can not say I did not warn you.
