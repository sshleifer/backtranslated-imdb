The film did what it set out to do: show how a young girl deals with poverty and grows in her maturity. However, for most of us, this subject has been properly explored and in most cases with more sophistication than here. The film fixed itself on the breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If this were on TV, I would have switched to the latest news in the Starr Report. It was so annoying that I found this movie.
