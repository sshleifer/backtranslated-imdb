Tony Scott directs a sports thriller that should appeal to even non-sports fans. And some say that baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too slow. Well, cheer up! From the outside, he appears to be a disgruntled salesman (Robert De Niro), while inside he is a psycho fan of the San Francisco Giants. Along comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and designated savior of the slime. Our salesman nurtures a murderous obsession when the hard hitting all stars fall into the worst fall of his career and the giants are afraid of collapsing along with him. De Niro is terror personified. Snipes looks very natural as the ball player. Other notables in the cast are: the still attractive Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You're a free agent ... so enjoy. Violence and very strong language are expected and you earn your money.
