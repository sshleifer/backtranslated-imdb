This really should deserve an "O" rating, or even a negative ten. I watched this show for a long time, and the show jumped the shark around the 7th series. This episode, however, is proof that the show jumped on the shark. Writing is lazy, absurd, self-indulgent, and not even worthy of trash like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, the mummy, Count of Monte Cristo - all the "fun" movies that should not be taken seriously. However, there is something so ridiculous as "this is the worst thing I have ever seen". And, in fact, this is the worst Stargate episode I've ever seen. It's absolutely terrible, and this comes from someone with a stargate in their basement. <br /> <br /> It makes me want to sell all my stargate props, more seriously.
