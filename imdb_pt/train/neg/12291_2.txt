Hmm, an Italian film starring David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I did not expect much, to be honest and, in fact, I took even less than I expected. This does not mean that this movie is the worst I have ever seen because I have seen worse things than that but the plot was mostly confusing and uninteresting and some good scenes are the only thing that saves this. In addition to what you will love some special effects, they are really extravagant and bad. Now I just want to watch "Troll 3" by this same director, it sure will not be worse than that.
