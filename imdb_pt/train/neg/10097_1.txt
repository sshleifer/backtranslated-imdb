I stopped by BB and got 4 zombie movies to watch over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be insignificant and the sets will be suspicious. So I'm not expecting much. But it should at least have a story. The stories cost nothing but time ... apparently, they also had no time at all. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie and that all looked like prostitutes of new waves. The zombie image on the cover NEVER appears in the movie. It was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre. <br /> <br /> The running time is only 81 minutes, but it seemed like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room), it sounded like zombie porn .... which, if you think, sounds kind of disgusting ... but it was not even that good . <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that perhaps the writer tried to do many things and ended up with an incoherent mess. <br /> <br /> Turned out to be a free rental and still feel stolen. I rated 1 out of 10 because IMDb does not allow me to use decimals.
