I only watched DVD 1. The program itself may have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise, they are imprecise insinuations of religious people. It is as if director Brian Flemming recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and he feels with these tools that he can easily oppose his opposition. <br /> <br /> In addition, Flemming wanders extensively on his own personal issues, and they take control. movie. He never comes back. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive education. Arguments of such victimized people seem irrational and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will want more data. Needless to say, religious people are crazy, just as American Jews need to know how Christmas music is annoying in mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, Fleming's superintendent Christian school of childhood confronts the director based on his motives. This seems to be the most honest part of the movie, and it was very short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming was a little more self-conscious, he could have a good story about him (past and current). ) relationship with Christianity, and abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth. <br /> <br /> And maybe he could lend his material "Christ has never walked the earth" to a more serious documentary filmmaker. I am not studying the writings of Saul / Paul to find out how impervious this whole thing is, but a quick search on Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> Bonus interviews are very good. , they do not reinforce Fleming's thesis. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV, and it does not illuminate these other non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good interviews (and easy with Google) at Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
