This is no horror, since the first part was: This is light and comical entertainment. As in so many sequences, the action begins immediately without explanation. But there are breasts, so I do not complain. And real boobs that are. If I understand correctly, these are very rare today among the American teenage girls of A. What brings me to mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen. <br /> <br /> This can not be thought without the first film, so I liken this to it. Again, there are very small clothes (mainly pants) and funny hair, it is not difficult to tell in which decade this film is made. Again, there are really strange characters, this time even more visibly "pathological." Especially the camp staff. It's like a summer camp for mental rehabilitation. People are older: most of the actors must be at least 25 years old, but I think they must be 16 or something. Some "methods" used by Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant. In fact, this film does not have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than in every way.
