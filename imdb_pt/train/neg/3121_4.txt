This movie is poor in trash. It tastes awful, and it's pedestrian and unconvincing in the script, though supposedly based on real events - which does not add much of anything, but makes it more of a disappointment. The direction is not well done when scenes and dialogues are out of place. I'm not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. To begin with, Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup, nor is the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, your character is compelled by an ugly story of pedophilia that is basic and has no place like a plot device. You have an old Rory Culkin singing tastelessly "d_ck_smker" - in good fun - which is annoying enough and then laughed at the character Williams. Finally you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel adviser for Williams and an explanation of all the fiasco in the end. The character of Toni Collete is simply annoying and a re-hash of his sixth sense with a worse direction. Very Miss-able.
