The only redeeming qualities of this film are the rather original death scenes. Also, this movie is a great DUD. We have Kim Basinger, the besieged housewife wandering slowly through the local mall in the first 30 minutes. of the film, which did not add anything. Then the movie catches up a bit as she has a clash with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spots on this busy Christmas Eve. They begin to chase her after they shoot down the local security guard who tried to help her. From there, this movie gets worse, much worse. I know it's just a movie and you have to go with the flow, but it takes about 5 min. Headstart and she can not hide or find someone to help her. Instead, it leads to a partially built subdivision next to a forest. Typically, she does everything she can to allow her followers to follow her easily. But now it turns into a hard mofu. You understood. Under no circumstances do you buy or rent this movie, no matter how much you enjoy it. It is so illogical that you will be questioning every scene. It's embarrassing to Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast as well as consumers.
