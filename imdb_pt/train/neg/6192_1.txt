The Great Rapture of Robert Carmichael is a bad movie in every way. The script, the dark rhythm, the lack of depth in any character, the senseless subplots, the terrible acting, the unnecessary climax, all this makes it the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not find anything pleasant, pleasant or intellectually stimulating. I imagine the filmmakers thought they were doing something clever and somber with their unstable lighting, long silences and vaguely haunted by the classic soundtrack. If so, they have totally failed. He only bored me, and I wish I had never attended. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
