This film is classified as a classic in not feeling in any quality movie production. It goes from the improbable to the unbelievable, from the unrealistic to the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu soldier to rescue a third soldier who was captured by the insurgents. Indians In the later scene, we see a regiment filled with drum and bagpipes marching in ambush. In the British Army, a sergeant does not order an ransom attempt, and if you go through it, he will not try with just another Indian soldier and servant when there is a full regiment in hand. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept that they are laughable ... there are hundreds of them, but they can not arrest their prisoners or kill the two saviors, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers throwing stone blocks from the insurgents' battlements, which are scattered along the mountainside in an ambush ... you would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think it would do some damage. After Cary Grant when the rescued prisoner is shot, he is lying on the ground looking around at the water boy ... hardly the actions of someone who was shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows a bugle (coming from nowhere) to sound the alarm ... this he does by standing on the top of a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys, and we shed a tear while he he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the horn sounds in weak cries ... instead of playing the horn while hiding behind the hood as anyone with half the brain would do. This scene was deservedly parodied in sketches of comedy. If they wanted to do a Buster Keaton comedy, they should have hired Keaton and done better.
