Spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, END OF THE WORLD is a singularly disappointing cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> Here's the full story: a scientist is receiving messages from space (the INDEPENDENCE DAY). The messages say things like a huge disaster are about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a major earthquake happened in China. He begins to think that messages have something to do with disasters around the world, so he is trying to figure out who is getting the messages (and who is also sending messages in space). He and his wife eventually discover that the messages come from a convent. They visit him. Everything seems normal, including the priest interpreted by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is inflexible and really believes the messages are coming and going to that convent. Thus, he and his wife secretly return to the convent, where they are caught snooping on the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need for them to return to their planet. Once the alien acquires the special element, all aliens depart one by one to their home planet on some sort of tacky transportation platform. Lee, being the last alien left, tells the couple that Earth will be destroyed because of some kind of false decision by the aliens. Lee enters the transporter and he is gone. The couple, looking at the monitors that show images of natural disasters occurring around the world, decides to follow the aliens. Because the land is doomed, the couple does not see any point to be left behind, so they walk on the transporter and disappear. The last scene in the movie is a papier mach√© exploding planet. The end. <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a boring movie in my life. It's the most amazing film I've ever experienced. The scientist and his wife are two of the worst heroes or protagonists in history. They do not care about anything. They see the disasters of earth on the monitors and decide "what the hell, who needs the earth, anyway?" They do not even try to stop them or do something to make things better. This kind of story could have worked if the film had a overwhelming sense of everything except the action and atmosphere nonexistent. The actors and the people behind this movie are going through their footsteps, so much so that you can almost feel it when they punch your cards when they leave and return to work. I was not expecting much with this movie because it is a production of Charles Band, but I did not expect it to be that bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was once asked what his worst movie ever was. and he mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS. Well, I'm sorry, Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS was really fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible, but terribly fun. THE END OF THE WORLD is VERY, VERY, MUCH worse: it is beyond monotonous and inert, with no entertainment value.
