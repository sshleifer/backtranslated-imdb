This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a VHS previously seen without being seen. That was a mistake. In what could have been a very good story - about badly crippled people in a hospital, and their various personalities - quickly turned into a very profane novel with enviable characters. <br /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe) stereotypical racist white person, who says f-word every other phrase and is so contemptible that they did not give him a first name in the movie. He's a lot of fun to be around. Then there's "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a womanizer who talks fast. Snipes must have liked those arrogant, quick roles because he played in a number of them, as in "White Men Can not Jump." Then there's the sweet Helen Hunt playing "Anna" that wonderful, caring and loving person who is having an adulterous affair with the film's main character, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yes, it's comforting, kind of good stuff. It just makes my heart melt by watching these nice people. But if you are one of those who loves despicable characters portrayed by despicable people in this despicable movie ..... you can really enjoy it! Add a dose of Hollywood fix policy and there you go! What more could anyone want?
