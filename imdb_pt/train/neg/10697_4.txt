First of all I thought it was disobedient of them to say in the credits that the story and the script were of Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of Hollywood's best writers until his talent disappeared and he retired. However, it was not Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on the Robert Louis Stevenson tale "The Bottle Imp". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any desire, but that will end up condemning him to hell. That's nice. No one said writers had to be original. The actors are usually quite competent given the mediocre writing they had to translate to the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks he has found a way out of his dilemma, but tries to solve the problem in a slightly different way, in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first, this seems to have worked, but true to the code of the modern horror movie, they feel they have to provide one last dose of horror at the end of the movie. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films did very well, allowing the hero to win in the end. There is nothing wrong with triumphing over evil, no matter what the current crop of filmmakers seems to think. You can give the public a good healthy scare and still make you feel happy in the end. Actually, I think it's preferable.
