This movie was a waste of time, even rented on DVD. If super fast camera shots are faster than that, you'd better pay twenty dollars to get into the laundry room, get some popcorn, and watch the dryer spin. Jet Li is way better than that. One can only hope that he will not make deals soon to make another clich√© movie like The One. If there is a movie you should avoid, this is "The One."
