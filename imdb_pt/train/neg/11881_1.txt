This movie is nothing like "Office Space" except on the premise. Office Space was hilarious. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, since I did not laugh once throughout the movie. Mr. Cornbluth's self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than Jason Alexanders in the same room. If you decide to watch this movie, use a free rental or watch it at someone else's house to be able to leave, if necessary.
