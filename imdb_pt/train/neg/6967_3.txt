Oh God, what an idiot movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (the creature is played by a costumed guy) and stupid plot. All the dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they're just ridiculous. For example, I've never seen characters as annoying as this garbage (these stupid kids or pregnant women with your husband and many more ). Overall, it's great entertainment if you're drunk. Like the plague I'm drunk I do not think so
