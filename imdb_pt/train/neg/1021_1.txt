The film started strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as a police officer in disguise, with partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott of practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) Committing robbery and murder. Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. The other big names (Freeman, Spacey et al) are well presented and the film shows promise. <br /> <br /> The movie begins to fail as soon as Justin Timberlake (Pollack) is introduced. Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will likely see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will see for the first time because of Timberlake, I would choose the first one. Even talented actors have to work hard in their craft; Timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him. I would have thought that he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. Everything he did in that movie was not convincing. <br /> <br /> Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells stadia, it does not automatically mean that they can perform successfully in feature films. Even N'Sync's hardcore fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of talent. <br /> <br /> That aside, there are some holes in the plot, such as Pollack's sudden sniper skill and the deadly operation of warehouse machines. This movie was very promising. Completely disappointing.
