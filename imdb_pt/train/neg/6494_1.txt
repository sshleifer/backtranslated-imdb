I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested to see how he would do as a writer / director. I could not have been more disappointed with this move. The film was so disconnected and the cinematography was so finished that I wanted to unplug the wall. The actors were very good, but it was a waste of talent. Not all actors are cut to be writers or directors, and clearly Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the movies I've seen in my 50s, this is absolutely the worst movie of all time. Please do us all a favor, Mr. Hopkins, and keep acting, what you are excellent at, and leave writing and driving to those who are talented in those areas. If I could give this movie a rating lower than one, I certainly would.
