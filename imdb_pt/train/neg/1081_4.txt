There is not a single nice character throughout this movie. Is the lawyer interpreted by Kenneth Branagh by which we should be pulling? Well, let's see - we have learned that he is a sleazebag defense lawyer who takes the criminals out of the technical details. He treats his coworkers as cattle, engages them in his own personal crisis (in the process, killing one of them), endangers the safety of his children, threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend, tries to strengthen the police and school administrators - and all that for what? Because he was THINKING WITH YOUR SMALL HEAD! I was actually pulling for the father and his gang to hit the lawyer's stuffing and drown him in the swamp ... would have made for a much more satisfying end.
