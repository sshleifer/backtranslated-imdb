Nothing in this movie is funny. I thought the premise, giving a human the libido of a ram randy, was interesting and should provide some laughter. WRONG! There's simply nothing funny about the movie. For example, the main character who makes a pass on a goat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny, as it borders obscenity. They're playing with bestiality in this movie on one level, and that's not funny. <br /> <br /> We all know dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character doing it with everything, everywhere, every time is not funny either. It becomes a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is, I think, acceptable on paper. By that, I mean he's not a bad actor, but with rotten material it's hard to comment on the quality. However, Coleen Haskell, the other half of the HUMAN romantic tracks (does anyone count the number of animals in which the main character also has an interest, such as romantic leads?), Seems ashamed of the whole thing as it should be. She seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum, separate from all the other actors in the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to get bored with meaningless, bland and repetitive material.
