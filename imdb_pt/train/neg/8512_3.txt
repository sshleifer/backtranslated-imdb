I like silent movies, but that was a bit of an idiot. As much as I wish I could say it was worth the time I got up, I can not. I do not think any version of the movie comes close to the book. And do not try with children, they can freak out. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know that labor laws were different at that time ... BUT ON PEOPLE.
