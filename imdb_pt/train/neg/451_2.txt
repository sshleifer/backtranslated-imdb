I do not care how many nominations this trash has for the better this and that, this movie stinking. I did not know if I should turn off the device, or file a lawsuit with O.J's attorney for unfair damages to my mental health. I've seldom been so bored; Call it entertainment manure is a slap in the face of every movie buff. The whole story was idiotic, the acting had no inspiration, the "drama" was without emotion. I am grateful for not having to pay for this unsatisfactory experience.
