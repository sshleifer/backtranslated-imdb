I watched as 8 or 9 Herzog films and none of them had any impact on me. <br /> <br /> I watched several documentaries about it. He is obviously an intelligent man with a great knowledge of movies and a passion for doing them, but that makes him a good director. Definitely not! A complete anti-talent. Can he make a good documentary because of the previously mentioned traits, but a movie with actors? Never! <br /> <br /> He can not drive or write. His scripts are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and ill-done that they can not be hidden behind the word "art" in any sense. No way. Not to mention the awkward, amateurish direction. To say he wants to drive like that and write crap like that is a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene in which Scheitz is arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the shop. WHO IS HE PLAYING? <br /> <br /> He's a cheater; he knows what false intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get his attention and empty compliments. No matter the rest of the script and sloppy direction. <br /> <br /> Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem's, then I can re-check his old films and try to find talents in them.
