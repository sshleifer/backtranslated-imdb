I might not have been the biggest fan of Blair Witch, but I still enjoyed that effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives scattered in several IMDb comments. "One," "Smart," "A Classical Future," and so on ... you must wonder where people invent these things to describe such an unsatisfactory endeavor. <br /> <br /> Because, unfortunately, Altered is a weak and weak film that does not involve any and all respect. Foolishness is not funny. Horror and blood are not scary. And whatever "thought" aspect some poor people have seen in this movie was due to serious delusions, because there is certainly nothing deep or clever about this mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so we know that nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worth it in any way? Unfortunately not. For starters, have a very bad performance. It is no exaggeration to say that most B movies nowadays have better acting. The plot? Boring and confusing. Dialogues Many amateurs really do better. <br /> <br /> It's really the direction that puzzles. I did not expect big improvements on the Blair witch, but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have gotten worse over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences. <br /> <br /> If there is a major flaw in Altered, it's the main set. An important part of the plot occurs in a single location, where the main characters are confined, but Sánchez failed to give the place any personality. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays an important role and is both a character (an antagonist, if you will) and the three students, you would think the director would realize that the same thing was needed here. But no ... this place has no personality at all, thanks to a sloppy direction and no attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There is nothing usable here. Blair Witch's toughest fans are better off after Daniel Myrick. Although her production is far from gold, it shows a better structure than Sánchez and some Blair Witch lessons are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories, but still).
