This is one of the most tasteless, dull, unoriginal, and senseless films of all time! It almost seems like everyone involved in this project did not even try to make an attractive movie. This is nothing more than the continuation of a grueling series of films that try to profit from the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think is the best movie of them all. As for this waste of film stock, Burt Reynolds dreams about the whole movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors do not have much to do, car races are obviously movie pictures, humor is uninspired and many scenes are more monotonous and lifeless than looking at a wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it.
