"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to take place in an immaculate underworld, a long-lost era, where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be to defy the law and get a traffic ticket. It starts with a young car fanatic, getting the business from her archrival, who pressures her into a car race. That's about it for drag-racing - this B-flick is more concerned with rock 'n roll, dude! The staff at American International obviously liked honest, decent teens who liked to party and still did not care for an adult escort. There are some double entenders and fruit changes (Necking Kid: "We thought about going out for some fresh air" ... Dad: "Where did you think it would be in her throat?"), But the ghost arrives a bit late . Brief at 65 minutes, the movie deceives us with a climactic car race that really happens off-screen and a pre-"unmasked" Scooby Doo-style that does not make sense. However, for nostalgia fans, some nonsense fun. ** in ****
