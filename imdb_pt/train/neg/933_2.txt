Unfinished / unbelievable plot, (by the time I sort of figured out where he was going, I did not care anymore) Bad casting (come on ... William Macy as a killer ???) bad direction, (you have already seen Tracey Ullman performing so poorly?) (Should I care what happened to the incompetent and unethical character John Ritter?) Bad script ... (Actually, I'm not looking for a formula script but this was really awful The only really good thing about that was the boy Ten lines Is not it all right if your comment has less than ten lines COme on - whose rules are these Why can not I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines? Is not this arbitrary? Why is it not acceptable to have less than 10 comment lines?
