I have absolutely no knowledge of author Phillipa Pearce or any of his novels and if TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of his work, I would probably have little interest in his books as a child. When I was a kid, I was not really interested in literacy unless there were soldiers fighting monsters with a high body count. Judging by this film version of TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN, I think Pearce writes for less middle-class kids, since much of the story revolves around the protagonist Tom Long moving into a house without a garden, suddenly finding a metaphysics. Having a garden of its own was certainly something that working-class people did not have in the 1950s, so I guess there's some subtext of political class somewhere. There is also a novel involving a young girl named Hattie, but again are cynical children amoured by love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the form of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative. <br /> <br /> This is a childish film that seems dated by its source. It's harmless, but I'm surprised by its high rating by the IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have given so many high marks if they were 10 years old that they just saw the Lord of the Rings trilogy?
