Before watching this movie, I read a review saying that this movie could be one of the best movies of all time! ha ha Cena the scene the tension grows well ... of the annoying characters in this movie. Of the little girl talking grumpily and trying to drown the little boy, to the murderer running without warning (and who was the guy on the beach talking to the little boy !?) ... things seem to happen and then go away unanswered in this movie. While I was watching, it looked like the movie was going in one direction, so I was not going anywhere, but in a new direction ... and so on ... <br /> <br /> Performance is great, but the writing is horrible. Each character in each scene says or does something so unbelievable, unrealistic, and the reactions of castmates / extras are simply strange. There are no resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film, making it confusing and ultimately a great waste of time.
