The genre of thriller films really takes a dip in this. The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that you need to create difficult situations that would cause suspense and tense feeling of what will happen next, but this film was so predictable and simply not believable. I think the more I watch this kind of movie, the more I'm continually saying things to the actors to direct them away from danger. Continually making bad decisions only borders on being completely stupid. If they had time to make it more realistic, I might have liked it a little. That said, you may be better off staying away from this.
