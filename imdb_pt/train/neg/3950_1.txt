Before I did not know that in the early 90's Devry University (or was it ITT Tech?) Added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs. Well, this movie must have been the product of the class orator. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the other side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Horrible horrible awful. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker adds two main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman has had dreams with the bogeyman and the victim of the first film. More than 50% of this movie is stocked from the original film. The rest of the film is the main character having the nightmares while his therapist talks about the narrator. These scenes are filmed through a filter so dense that the characters shine. They would make Angela Lansbury be 25 years old. So to recap, horrible. Do not watch this movie.
