Well, no, not really. Not really a good movie, but not as bad as I thought it would be. I do not really feel stolen from my rented money, and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing shiny or new, the acting is really bad but the cast is handsome. The direction is acceptable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a big problem. There was a pretty decent amount of nudity, which to me is a very good thing, but it was not that hot. In short, it's a fairly direct average for video movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen and if you're bored a fan of genre, check it out at some point. I even watched again. <br /> <br /> Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in some of them) plays the werewolf.
