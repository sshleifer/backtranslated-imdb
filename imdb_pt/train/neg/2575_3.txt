This does not really correspond to the Cagliostro Castle. Lupine is not so funny or crazy or so hyperactive. The scenery and the music are not inspired and the plot is not interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about it is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped to spice up some of the tedious scenes. The CoC had a formidable villain and set the film up for some imaginative scenarios. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen do not even offer decent sideshow entertainment at this time. It is as if they are just fulfilling a contractual obligation appearing. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in full-frame mode with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including some trailers. But a curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player after it is inserted. Although you can still jump to the next scene number using the remote.
