I'm a big Stephen King fan. I loved the man running. So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a movie of it. And when a local network showed the movie, I was in heaven. I was all set for a fun night! <br /> <br /> The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had climbed Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just could not believe that a man who became famous for movies full of races and shootings could play a smarter role, as described in the book. I was still convinced that this would be a good movie, though. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not know. I soon discovered that the only reason he was even chosen was because someone had rewritten the whole story to do about fighting and 'firing'. Yes, it was a standard Arnold movie: hero is made wrong, hero solves problems by flexing his powerful muscles and scaring everyone and the hero picks up the girl. <br /> <br /> I was shocked. This is not what the book said. I know books can not be put on the screen literally, but that does not even have any ties to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden to use the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film. I do not say that often, but this movie was bad. If I was not at home watching, I would have thrown rotten tomatoes on the screen. One more time: bad. <br /> <br /> (Note that I used a lot of 'someone'.) I did this because I'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on it and I do not want to embarrass them even more by naming them here)
