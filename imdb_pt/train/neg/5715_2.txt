'Say Yes' is one of those movies that you hope is improving, but it never does. It's the kind of 'unmotivated psychopath decides to threaten an innocent couple', so loved by filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is clumsy and, in several places, mistranslated. The performance is uniformly poor, especially the villain of the play, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that without blinking and trying to speak with a deep voice, he is making his character look menacing, when all he really does is make it seem a bit simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves special mention. , how stupid it is beyond belief. The 'heroes' do not find it very strange that their ride threatens to kill them. The "heroine" can twice lose sight of the villain when he is no more than 30 centimeters from her. The villain passes a police station (wearing a blood-covered shirt and a bloody bandage on his head) showing the police a burned corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. The villain is punched, struck with a shovel, and trapped with a fork, but he never seems to be prevented by these serious injuries. And do not even start me on this terrible 'twisting' end. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie, to me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very beautiful, but in fact is no more than a mediocre actress. Overall, this film comes off as a poorly written, flaccid and shockingly driven attempt to copy 'The Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos', but fails at every turn due to the lack of talent at all involved.
