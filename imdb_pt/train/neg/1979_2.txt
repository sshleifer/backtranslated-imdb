Hmm, hip hop music for a western period. Modern phrases like "cool" and many others to follow. "The sistahs are in the house" The well-groomed French nails in tough girls. Microphone packages CLEARLY visible on the back of Li'l Kim. I just can not keep up with the litany of mistakes made by the director and editors. <br /> <br /> The acting is not as bad as I've ever seen. Women did well enough with poor writing. <br /> <br /> It was strange to hear Louis Mandylor speaking in his native accent. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. The fabulous costumes, though completely incorrect. I just can not believe they would dull what could have been a great story. I would be offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such pitfalls that it would play well in the center of the city. <br /> <br />
