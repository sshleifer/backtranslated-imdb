A low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body appears in a stolen car in Central Park, and her only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although released by RKO, this has the appearance of an independent production that was acquired by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions - among them an unreliable young man like Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - are made up of complete strangers, and that shows. The performances are universally insignificant and would not go through a high school training film, the direction is indigestible and unstable and, as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry among the major actors. However, despite the many shortcomings of the film, it has some good points. The shooting location in New York, and the ultra-low budget of the film, gives it an authenticity very similar to that of "The Naked City" superior, a shooting in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigation procedures are clever . Otherwise, there is not much to write about. It is worth, however, to take a look at sections of New York City dressmakers in the early 1950s, and old-car fans will be in awe as they watch the legions of cars from the 1930s and '40s on the streets. > <br />
