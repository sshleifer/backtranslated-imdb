A largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent John Cleese (though he's actually sending his performance in Fawlty Towers). It seems to move from the top of the slapstick to the superficial sentimentality in the fall of a hat, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn have to "meet", who they are, and so on. See at your own risk.
