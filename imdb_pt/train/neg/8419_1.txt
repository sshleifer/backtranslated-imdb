I was eager to see Dreamgirls for a long time ... with all the criticism, pointers and attention of the media. And I must say that the first room of the movie was good! He really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, as the movie went by, I and our entire family were bored. The chant kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just another number of music and would have broken even with RENT. <br /> <br /> In addition, I noticed almost no character development in any of the characters; I just do not care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just could not feel any emotion for this character. The characters received a fragile background on singing in their infancy and everything else, but personalities were not revealed enough to attract me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the character's lack of development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall, I think this movie would be the most appropriate for someone who does not care about a general story, but who would enjoy two hours of fun and fun singing presentations.
