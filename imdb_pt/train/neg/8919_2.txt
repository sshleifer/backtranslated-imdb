I saw this for the first time when it was chosen as a suggestion of my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. Plus, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and it started with the look of his' 30s cartoon. With both, I thought it would be interesting for me. I was wrong. Just a few minutes later, and I pushed the fast forward button. I went through it in about 15 minutes, and thought that was it. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, I read some of the other reviews here and realized that I did not give enough of a chance. I recorded again and watched. There are 75 minutes of my life that I'm not getting back. <br /> <br /> I can not believe there are no more bad reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's difficult to get at least 10 comments. How many ways are there to say that this is a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The movie appears as if it were made by some high school kids ready to outraged the world and think they can with their breasts, swearing and vomiting jokes. The characters are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is lame, essentially mending the melody, passing through A - E, reaching the obvious "F" word, and then having no idea where to go. The journey through the intestines to the expected landing does not work the first time, much less the following. <br /> <br /> On the whole line, the whole movie is what you would expect from someone trying to "out of the South Park" Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and is not funny. This can be fun if you are tall. Otherwise it is not.
