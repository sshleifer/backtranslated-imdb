... for one of the worst Swedish films ever ... forgive me for being annoying. <br /> <br /> First of all I did not see the first one (I was bored that is my reason to watch the second before the first), well, I hope the first one is better than that, it was full of weird scenes and very strange plot changes, for people who saw this and think 4/10 is high (believe me, me too), but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre and I still laughed thinking about it punk that came up with this idea, which comes next "Det sjunde inseglet II". Sequels not based on romance or book are not great, and this is a perfect example of one. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll be honest with you: I laughed a little, There are some decent jokes and clown humor. But do not buy, rent. Just let some other jerk do this or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director probably already laughed ...
