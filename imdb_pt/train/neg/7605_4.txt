I think "Gunslinger" was not as horrible as most of the films that "Mystery Science Theater 3000" shows, but Westerners simply are not Roger Corman's forte. Portraying Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) becoming Sheriff in an Old West town after her sheriff's husband is murdered and having to fight off bad guys, the film is quite predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new husband, secretly working for Unison Allison Hayes (yes, the 15-meter woman). Also appears briefly the co-star of Millman, Dick Miller, like postman (Miller currently stars the films of Joe Dante). <br /> <br /> I'd like to state that you'll probably want to watch the "MST3K" version. to really enjoy this movie. They had a lot of fun.
