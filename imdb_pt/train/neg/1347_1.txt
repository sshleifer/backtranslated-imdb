Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite 80's cartoon of all time. I enjoyed both the first and second season of the series, as well as the 1992 Christmas special "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas." Some Gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season (1985) of the series, but they need to compare it with the release of "The Last Case: Claw's Revenge" from 2002, as they will find the second season as absolute gold. Being a fan of Gadget, I could not resist the opportunity to see the animated Inspector Gadget in something that was not related to Gadget Boy. I bought the movie and I promised myself that it would be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic freedoms would be taken from the original series. I was not even ready for what I was about to watch. <br /> <br /> There was only a fragment of the original show still intact. <br /> <br /> Here's a short list of just a few cons for this movie: * The humor is non-existent from the original series. Penny and Brain (originally having a nearly equal part in the series as Gadget) are absent from the action for fifteen at twenty minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * Saban & Levy's original music is not there, and the score that exists is insignificant. (Understanding that Saban has his own producer now, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" had good music, even without Saban.) * Do not expect to see any Gadget gadgets that made the show so captivating, like the gadget -copter , gadget-brella, mallet-gadget, gadget-coat (which actually was used, but was not even called the same thing) as well as his other hat and hand gadgets. In that film, the legs of his gadgets were telescopic instead of springs. This kind of thing bothers the true fans of the program, and it just does not need to change. <br /> <br /> * The gadgetmobile of the original series is now a fast-talking, supposedly "hip" convertible. All fans of the original series liked the gadgetmobile turning into the gadget van and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Quimby's boss is now very grumpy and even half to Gadget. He has always been grumpy in the original series, but this pushes the situation a bit too much. <br /> <br /> Penny does not have a computer book anymore. <br /> <br /> Is there any good point in this movie? ? OK, here it goes ... Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking on the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget. In one scene, boss Quimby alludes to a villain in the cartoon series: the Great Wambini (the classic villain "Gadget" of the second season, voiced by Louis Nye). Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie? Well, you're out of luck. Life is about making choices and living according to those choices. Most situations in life have a purpose, even if it is to teach a lesson. The lesson learned here: keep the original formula! "If it is not broke, do not fix it." True Gadget fans should avoid this movie; You will certainly be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I hope DiC and Shout! Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1," containing the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true fan of Gadget, 80's animation lover and many of DiC's programs, I ask you to buy the "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" DVDs that are excellent and safe to bring back good memories.
