A single woman named Stella (Bette Midler) gets pregnant with a rich man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation, but she rejects him and decides to raise the child by herself. Things will go OK until the child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) become worse. <br /> <br /> I saw both the silent version and the sound version of "Stella Dallas." Neither of them affected me much (and I cry easily), but they were well done if dated. Trying to redo this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I think Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of "Beaches" to do that. This (predictably) bombed. The story is laughable and dated by today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado perform well, this movie really creeps and I was bored at the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in supporting roles. Fragile and dull. Really - Who thought that would work? See the 1937 version of Stanwyck. I give this a 1.
