This movie really deserves the MST3K treatment. A pseudo-old tale of hack-n-slash fantasy featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective IQ of hot water, character names that seem to have been derived from a book Mad Libs and classic lines like "Hold it and find out your belly! "The Barbarians cross into the territory" so bad, it's good ".
