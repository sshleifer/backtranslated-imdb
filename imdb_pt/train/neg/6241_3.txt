Something that does not really fit well into Al Gore's theory (and its supporters) is the whole thing about "consensus." If there was such a consensus, why the "believers" in the all-powerful global warming, we feel the irrepressible need to try to intimidate anyone who questions them. <br /> <br /> Why is it that someone who does not follow the line of global warming is greeted with smug accusations of being stupid? or oil company payroll (apparently being a professional researcher of global warming does not mean you're on someone's payroll in that wonderful world ...) Why is there such a need to tell everyone how the whole issue is resolved , when is it the very nature of science to honestly question assumptions? For some ideas on answering these questions, read Prey from the well-known oil puppet Michael Crichton ... ah, wait, he's rich and he's not on the payroll of the oil companies. He only took a great career risk by not following the line of Greens and other believers in Kyoto and told the truth while researching. By the way, did you know that compliance with the Kyoto Protocol would result in almost no reduction in temperatures, according to its own funders? Just a few questions that Al Gore made sure he did not get paid every penny from the environmental lobby, in case he decides to run again. <br /> <br /> So, who's a clown ...?
