I tried to watch this show several times, but for a show called "That '70s Show," I do not think much beyond a few haircuts and the occasional reference to the disco that really evokes the 1970s - the decade that I grew up . From the episodes I've seen, most plots and jokes can be defined in any length of time. Take the news of (supposedly) set in the 70's, and the show is neither interesting nor funny. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a program that most successfully represents the youth experience in America in the 1970s, in my humble opinion, you can not do better than "The Wonder Years."
