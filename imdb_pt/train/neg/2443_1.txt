This is not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies of all time. It's so bad that I found it very enjoyable. the acting, oh my god, the script, you must be joking. As you can imagine the writer coming up with things like: - a child who makes fireworks at school, fireworks so powerful, that when someone is struck by it, they fly a hundred yards back and explode. -A girl is stuck in the celler, the killer is trying to open the door. she gets a drill bit, but the yarn is not long enough. she first makes an extension cord, oh the horror, and then, when it's over, she punches the door and punches the killer's head. WOW - and there are many more examples like that. oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he used to be great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
