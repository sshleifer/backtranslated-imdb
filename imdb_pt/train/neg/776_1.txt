I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather took his video for free at the mall. I remember it really sucked. The plot made no sense. I hated the fox who became friends with Casper. He was such an idiot! Casper cried his head if he could not find a friend. And? Leave it behind! The only good part and I do not want to sound evil was when the fox was shot and died in the end. I laughed in my head in return, because this cartoon sucked. The bad news is that the fox resuscitates and becomes a ghost. I wish he had been dead. I think I even gave the video of it to someone because I hated it. No wonder they were offering free at the mall. If you have a child, do not let him watch it. They'll probably agree with me that it sucks.
