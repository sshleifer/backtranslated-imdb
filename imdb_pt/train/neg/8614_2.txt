I have to confess that I was never a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. In fact, he does not respect me. I just watched it because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what I expected: a stupid story without any real humor. It's full of mean-spirited jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a Developer (Dangerfield) plans to build a Utah ski resort that just did not catch my eye. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield the film starred a weak cast, including Andrew Dice Clay and John Byner (I did not even know he was still around until I saw his name in the credits for that). <br /> This is truly a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
