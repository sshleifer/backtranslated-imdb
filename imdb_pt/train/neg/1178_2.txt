A completely ridiculous "period" film is only an excuse for her extensive and graphic description of the heroine's affair with "the beast," a monster that supposedly appears every century to rape some women. This is basically what he does, and the beast's depiction in the film is really horrible; is basically a tall guy in a skin suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for an erection that squirts large amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal pornography, I think maybe it's a real thrill. I had fun, however, with the initial shots of horses having sex in a public square.
