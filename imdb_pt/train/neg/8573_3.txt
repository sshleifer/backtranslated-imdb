I do not really like Sean Penn's direction, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no core, is colored with a kind of anti-authoritarian interpolation that, in all honesty, tarnishes most of Penn's work, his latest work still more than the previous. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such a fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some loyalty to honesty, but end up being for the most part glorified fighting games and moralists, almost as if cards of Hallmark had developed a line of greetings from the Angels of Hell, and made me anxious for the Liberation days, which is a great movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is far, far more credible here than the ridiculous Eastern Promises he's made with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The film is meaningless and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Congratulations to Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more from the character of Sandy Dennis. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this crap from the Indian Runner.
