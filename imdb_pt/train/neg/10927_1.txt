Reviews for this movie were warm at best, while expectations were very high: a big budget, tons of popular faces, a pretty funny idea and a leading actress that everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's supposedly humorous journey into the fantasy world failed in every way to entertain the audience (I did not hear a single chuckle throughout the performance), going through the story line and one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a signal of the magic he wished he had. The 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come as professionals in a feature that certainly could not seem as good an idea on set as more on paper. "L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay" is a collage of comic sketches, tied to a thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
