Seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci could live up to his old tricks. Unfortunately, in addition to the close-ups of a decaying corpse, there is little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his daughter's quest to find out who killed him. None of the characters are attractive, and when you find out how they did it (that turnaround, at least, was cool), you stop caring. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than Nightmare Concert!
