Wow ... I can not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (also known as VIOLENT SH! T 3) really is. I heard the rumors, read the comments - but I had to decide for myself. Well, let me tell you - IT BLOWS !!! The worst performance of any movie ever made, dubbing that must have been done while all involved were completely lost, awkward and laughable, no noticeable plot, "cinematography" that looks like my grandmother filmed with her camcorder, props of weapons that are no joke - made of aluminum foil - the list goes on ... <br /> <br /> Three guys get stuck on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic swords and tin foil. Two of the captives are released along with a rebel of island freaks, and receive a day of advantage before being hunted by the rest of the "tribe" ... this is very beautiful ... <br /> <br /> Honestly - this is one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to undergo too. The budget had to be about $ 200 and was spent entirely on the FX (which actually may not have been a bad idea ...). There is NOTHING for ZOMBIE DOOM besides ridiculous and ridiculous scenes with many HORRORS dubbed. This film makes other exits without budget as PREMUTES: THE LORD OF THE DEAD VIDOS looks like TITANICS. Some might rank ZD in the "so-bad-it-good" category - and I think if you're really drunk or loud and watched it with some friends in the MST3K style - I think it could be seen that way. But not for me. I hated practically everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally shocking and included as a "bonus" in the Shock-O-Rama version of ZD) is indicative of other works by Andreas Schnaas - then he should be banned from having anything to do with make a movie again on pain of death. There's a fun kung-fu battle in the second half of the movie, and a lot of blood - so I'll grant this one a very generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip this one.
