This movie was long and boring. Amazingly we were selected for Cannes, although they tend to like pretense. The point is that, unlike other Dutch stars of the artistic genre like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels totally empty. Even more, it has no film quality. A long opening shot does not mean cinematic depth, it's just a long boring shot. The story was not interesting and the characters had problems that I could not identify with. The actors did not shine under him and seemed lost at times. Leopold tried, but she's not the talent I expected her to be. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They actually made some waves in Dutch cinema. Leopold just made another attempt.
