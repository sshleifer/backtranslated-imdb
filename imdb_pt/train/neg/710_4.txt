I read Rice's novel with interest and I was quite charmed by its characters and the heartbreaking story based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, I was simply CALLED on this disastrous adaptation. The cast was based only on physical appearance, not acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was not blond or was able to get out of the wet paper bag). The embarrassing and inconsistent attempts by the cast to influence a French accent were hilarious, but not in a fun way. I found myself shuddering through this messy, melodramatic tripe, and was surprised that I drew to a close. <br /> <br /> A warning to fans of romance - stay away from this.
