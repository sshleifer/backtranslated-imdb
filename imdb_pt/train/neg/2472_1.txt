Anyone who really has the ability to watch this movie and walk away feeling like a good movie does not enjoy quality movies. This film was an insult to watch, the direction was the quality of high school film class as well as cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better photography and I hate this movement with a passion! The plot had the potential to be a very good very intense film, but fell out of the first 10 minutes in the rest of the film. Someone mentioned that this movie was about a child's imagination, that's okay and okay. But they could still have done better with this script than what they did. I mean, let's go, the Indian in the store. The boy looked at the little idol and suddenly imagined the Indian and the whole story about an Indian spirit named Wendigo? What they mention to the store clerk and she casually says there's no one but me who works here, so you think it's a scary ghost, but then she just trades the amount on the idol and we forget the kid seeing this guy. That was so stupid that it goes beyond the pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital, but also with the feeling of OMG !!! Why the hell I just wasted my time watching it !! This is a move I recommend NOT watching, there are definitely better quality films out there that will not insult your intelligence! Thank God I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have required my money back! For those who were easily entertained by this film ... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of film production to really say it was a good movie.
