Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at the "modern day" of Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directing job since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat of a big casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly with an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches all scenes in the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Doing this cool and laid-back role is asking a lot of Janssen, who yells at everyone as a putative husband (he chews on Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a malicious man in search of his own identity, makes funny comments about how young people look at Vegas (give them another ten years), and their disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is beautiful as a conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a bit of fun as a dancer in an audition. Unfortunately, "Where is At" does not have much to offer except for the dating ruminations about ethics between adults and their kids, some quick T & A photos and fun-filled satirists in the game's high-stakes world. most of which has been covered so far, ad nauseum. ** in ****
