There's really no way around the shrub saying that, Lady Death: The movie just sucks. In addition to the fact that the main character is a well-endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional outbreaks of graphic violence, the film seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980 cartoon based on a line of figures of action. The villain even speaks as an aspiring Skeletor, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that seems to have been modeled after the villain's mastery of the old-fashioned Blackstar cartoon Saturday morning. Just do not expect any humor beyond the sometimes frighteningly bad dialogue. At other times, it seems like the kind of anime tale best suited to hentai, but there is no sex, no tempting rape (Thank God!) And very little sex appeal despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no limit to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and the bloody deaths. Essentially, what we have here is a feature-length episode of She-Ra, Princess of Power, but with more extravagant and bloodier clothes.
