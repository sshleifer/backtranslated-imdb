This movie has some beautiful settings and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is very nervous as the daughter and is no match for the mature interpretation of Olivia De Havilland in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist bent conclusion also runs counter to the austere conclusion of the Washington Square novel whose author, Henry James, parodyed feminism in some of her other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
