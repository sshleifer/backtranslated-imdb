Spike Lee has to be one of the most valued directors I've ever seen. He's the critic's darling because he's supposed to make movies with a "message" or he's so bohemian in his approach that makes critics who are soaked with Hollywood formula movies consuming their stuff just because they're different. Sam's summer does not even do it well. Cinematography and editing style are Oliver Stone, as well as the narrative. The plot is very much like "Do the right thing." The portrait of "Guidos" or the set of Italian American computers (of which I am one) is direct from Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of a macho Italian picking a fight with a much higher African-American is far, far more believable than the Italian caricature caricatures shown here (John Leguizamo's character being a possible exception). <br /> <Someone who saw this movie could not figure out how it would end? As soon as Richie entered the movie I could already see the fist on his face and the foot on his stomach, I could already see him being accused of being the killer. This character had the highest integrity throughout the film, so, of course, Lee will show what happens to the people who stand out in the crowd (that white comrade's beard!) <br /> <br /> Someone please, please Give Spike Lee a life pass to all the basketball games he wants. So maybe he's having too much fun getting a movie camera for a long time and we will not have to subject ourselves to his self-criticism, and besides, I will not have to see the critics (some of them I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh to an emperor without clothes.
