The serum is about a mad doctor who finds a serum that supposedly cures all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead, it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brain. The crazy doc creates some zombies from corpses and has some problems. There is a long lead in all the action, with lots of scenes for you to get acquainted with the characters. The crazy doctor's nephew goes into a car accident and the crazy doctor tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a C-class movie with OK acting, but some problems steer and some continuity errors. There is not much zombie action in this movie and the effects, though adequate, are nothing special. You can quickly move through the slow parts and get some enjoyment from the action scenes. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.
