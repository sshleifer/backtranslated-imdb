It was not the most useless animated film experience of all time, but it certainly can not be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a Mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, providing the first person narrative), and his journey across the borders of the Wild West. Basically he was born free among all the other horses in the beautiful landscape, so he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw away all those who try to ride him. However, when he escapes from his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a crush on the Little Creek female horse. In the end, after a few more leaks, being chased by the Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and taking a great leap through a gorge, Little Creek lets the Spirit go, and he also releases his female, and they run home of his field and fellow horses. Also starring Chopper Bernet as a sergeant. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Foreman Railroad, John Rubano as a Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I was hoping to see the horses speak in this movie, but it turned out to be one more Dumbo thing, and Bryan Adams's songs are not the most engaging, but it's not a terrible movie. He was nominated for the Oscar for Best Motion Picture and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Song for "Here I Am" by Bryan Adams. OK!
