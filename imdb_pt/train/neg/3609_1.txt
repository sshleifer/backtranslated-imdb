This has to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember watching it years ago when it first came out on video and for some strange reason I thought I liked it. So, like an idiot, I ended up buying the DVD as soon as it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even bother getting into the plot because it's so transparent that you can see through it anyway. I am a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I am accustomed to gross effects and poor acting, but these people take this to a whole different level. It's almost as if they were intentionally trying to make the worst humanly possible film ... if that was their goal, they did it. If they intended to make a movie that should scare you or make you believe in some form, shape or form that is real, then they have failed ... MYSELF! Avoid this movie ... read the plot synopsis and you've seen!
