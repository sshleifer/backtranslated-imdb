When this movie was released in 1997, "special effects", as they are, were poor. They would have been dated back to the 80s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX work. Certainly no one involved in the production of this movie was looking for an Oscar. It's a wild escape from the usual stuff of director Fred Olen Ray, most of whom have the word "Bikini" in the title (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from Lost Planet, etc.) and are little more than T movies & A, but here we are with a movie labeled "U" and pointed directly to the children. You have to give credit to him for diversifying !! This was a small success among the cults, straight to the video, which later resulted in a few sequences - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career quickly fell after 1982 "ET") plays the "invisible mother" of the film titles and returns to the sequel. Russ Tamblyn (whose career has been in free fall even more since 1961 "West Side Story") plays the villain Dr. Woorter It is probably fair to say that most of the cast was at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work in almost any only to pay the bills that month - except perhaps the young Trenton Knight as Josh, it is quite revealing that, although he worked before that movie, this child actor did not return to work after the sequel, "Invisible Mom 2." Maybe the movie was cursed. After all, he was not that bad. For a young actor, he is very good - no better or worse than any of his more experienced colleagues. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the effects of "invisibility" are noff, to say the least, the direction is weak, the writing is obvious and there is nothing to write about. There are no movies out there, and for anyone under the age of ten, this film will no doubt be quite watchable. Most adults will probably want to make an act of disappearance on their own while it's happening, and I would not blame them at all!
