This little watchable film was a bit difficult to be performed. Neither segment is good, but at least the first one was slightly fun, and the middle one was a little imaginative. The latter was simply brutal, and after sitting down with two comedy shorts, the third one was really painful to watch. Even by the low standards of a National Lampoon movie, this one seemed especially boring and unimpressive.
