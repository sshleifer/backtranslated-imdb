This is a fair little program about the paranormal, although it seems that Art Bell and his gang have figured out how to draw a career out of the attitude that Carl Kolchak exemplified. Of course, there probably would not be an X-File if that program had not prepared that audience very well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the superhero type, but he's a plausible guy (enough) to deliver heroic deeds. Check out his work on some of these old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here he is the main attraction, there does not seem to be a girlfriend or wife that is a distraction. In fact, there is not much sexual appeal to the show. Something I'm noticing too is that the rhythm is not really about suspense in a typical way. There's a lot of disposable humor in this show. Sometimes it sucks to get to the climax. There is a thread of this show coming up to the present MAD MEN shows in terms of style. Not that David Chase writes Mad Men, but the people who worked with him on The Sopranos have definitely imitated and inherited his serious-comic tone.
