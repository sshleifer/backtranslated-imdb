Wow, this movie was just awful. So bad that although I did not pay to see, I still wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> The film is not about anything intelligible. It's a miscellany of sci-fi cliché that was best done by much more skillful filmmakers. The performances, especially by the leadership, were exaggerated in a less engaging Ed Wood style. Speaking of Ed Wood, he would be proud of the character's dialogue. He is very taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor. Besides, it does not make sense, neither the plot, nor the lack of it. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are good, but not enough to go "oh wow, that's cool" and they just seem to be played to "be cool" rather than being a good plot device. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another mix of things that really never set any kind of mood. Once again, it seemed the director was just releasing songs in the film in an effort to "be cool". <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my final point. Maybe if the director really cared more about plot, story and dialogue, instead of trying to "be cool," he would not have made such a stupid cliché of a short film. <br /> <br />
