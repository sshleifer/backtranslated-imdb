Confused melodrama taken from a story by William Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark leads nursing homes, where his fragile wife battles with self-proclaimed Queen Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself draws attention to newcomer Lauren Bacall, who is putting her life back after the death of her husband and son. Fake and confusing, set in an indiscriminate time and place, and with a love story "David and Lisa" hidden in the plush swamp. Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry together, but this script does not give them anything to build. For exactly one hour, most of the dialogue concerns what to do with the curtains hanging in the library (this topic is not used as symbolism, but a red herring in a non-mystery!). The image hopes to show the disputes with which disparate people arrive when they are working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is correct, but unfortunately Minnelli's indirect way of uncovering this stew is neither informative, enlightening nor amusing. ** in ****
