It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me watch. <br /> <br /> There's nothing positive to say about this movie. There was for many years an idea that Madonna could act, but she can not. There's been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he's just average. A general embarrassment. <br /> <br />
