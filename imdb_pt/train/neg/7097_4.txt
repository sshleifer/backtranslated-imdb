This movie has an inexorably low class B price on all its scenes, effects, etc., to make you think you've spent 80% of your budget on Connery. It's like seeing some things about Wing Commander after Star Wars (beyond content). <br /> <br /> The story can be described in one word: FLAT. And oh my God I can not remember such an uninteresting villain from long ago. We are given no reason why he is so perverse (an innate defect, we are led to think :) or any real conviction or talent for his wickedness. <br /> <br /> If you are out of Connery, prefer to go `Hunting Forrester 'rentals.
