I tried to watch this movie abomination when I was five; I've never been the same since. Filled to the brim with drug-induced images that stink to the common delusions of its common asylum resident, this "movie", despite its colorful appearance, is not for humans, especially children. <br /> <br /> It begins innocently, with a poor boy who spoils the drum of his classmate (wait), passing his head through it; yeah, putting your head through it. But do not be afraid, my friends! He is quickly consoled by his flute, which is strange enough, I'll guarantee, but it's still acceptable. <br /> <br /> THEN: The movie turns into a combination of Wizard of Oz and Where the Wild Things Are. , but loses all the "hot and fuzzy" aspects of either of these two books. <br /> <br /> So, this six-meter yellow relative of Barney befriends this poor boy and plunges even deeper into despair. And to add to the nice series of horrible themes, a carnivorous boat, formerly a friend of the heterogeneous crew of grandfather clocks and "dragons", is added to the mix of chaos. The most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain, aptly named "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, she has her own problems: which, with an obvious plastic mask, restricts her facial expressions to having to deal with a broom handle whose gas level always seemed to be at a minimum in the most inopportune moments. As a result, one of his favorite pastimes was to dip his nose in the body of water that separated the land of Pufnstuf from his degenerate and decadent residence (I do not know where I would rather live). In short, this movie is terrifying ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on your audience as The Exorcist, then this is for you. Appreciate.
