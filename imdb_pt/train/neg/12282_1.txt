This was one of the most annoying horror movies I have ever seen. A college boy has an epidemic of nightmares involving wandering spirits in Alcatraz. Trying to deliver a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and a standard vampire show in the form of a bad 80s video clip, this movie is full of bad acting and an extremely slow story. Despite being such a bad and often laughable film (digging those mullets and the terrible dialogue), it would be good material for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the proud mention of the film. being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award for Academy of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil has a part in the film. It's a giant disaster, although one with a small group of followers (see other IMDb for this movie).
