I basically got this movie because I had seen the brilliant remake of Kitato Takashi of Zatoichi and was in disposition for another updated samurai tale, which also starred Asano Tadanobu. These two films are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and subverted the traditional cliches of the film samurai. Gojoe goes to the bottom of the well in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies that have other characters informing the audience how the main character is instead of having the character developing throughout the movie. . "You can not decide whether you're a monk or a warrior," says almost all the characters in Benkei's presence, but this inner turmoil is only conveyed within the character itself. Instead of character development, we have bloated, bloody and bloody battle scenes. Asano's character is underdeveloped and even seems like he is bored and does not know what he is doing there. I know he usually seems distant and cool and that's part of Asano's appeal, but this movie does not suit him. <br /> <br /> Much of the camera movement is nauseating. There is a scene that lasts forever in which the camera revolves around the main characters until my wife and I feel like vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and quite anti-climactic. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that really good samurai movies are not being made in Japan nowadays with this type of budget. The colors, the scenery and the costumes were great, but the rest is just a waste of time. I'd rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
