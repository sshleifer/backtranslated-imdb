I'm here again at your local mall (of course, because that's where the high school kids come out !!!!!) to demonstrate just how horrible "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" really is !!!!! To prove how bad this joke of a DCOM is ... <br /> <br /> ... let's get these four sumo wrestlers and put them in that photo booth. How ... cozy !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How horrible is that ????? It's so bad that the Disney Channel frees up its money once again with those exciting, yet tense seconds of promos, keeping viewers thinking, "When will this happen ?????" And then, suddenly, when it happens, for example, this not only has a higher TV rating than usual, but this was only seen once !!!!! Oh no!!!!! Once all !!!!! Also, this movie is about high school and other things, and believe me, I will not go further with what else is there ... <br /> <br /> Say ch ... smile !!! ! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
