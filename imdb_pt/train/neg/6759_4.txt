Another case of a decent case of DVD, denouncing the quality of the film. <br /> <br /> It was not so bad. Rochon does a useful job and damn! the cast is very similar. I've never seen many muscular guys go out together regularly. This movie really wanted to make you think Rochon was the killer, but it was not meant to be. My biggest problem with the film was that in the end I did not care much about who the killer was, and the real killer made little sense since it was unexpected and the filmmakers were thinking 'ha, betcha do not see the next one, sucker 'Yes, there were continuity errors about (mostly with the ever-changing wardrobe of Ms Rochon), but for an indie slipper it's not that bad. I was pretty sure that at the beginning it was just a veiled excuse for girls to be topless, but that was just a trick. The dialogue was overly thoughtful and painful at times. <br /> <br /> I just do not have high expectations going for it, and it will not be that bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's cameo is wonderfully discreet.
