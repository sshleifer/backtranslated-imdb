I had the misfortune to catch up on two of the worst 2004 films this morning: first, the CGC-driven incoherent emptiness of The Chronicles of Riddick, and then the embarrassing vanity project known as Greendale. One million dollar cost and the other cost pennies, but both are bad. Really, really bad. To begin with, I must say I'm not the biggest Neil Young fan in the world, but he contributed his share of classic songs: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were young compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps , Harvest, and Mirror Ball, the man wrote some great songs. Unfortunately, there are no great songs in Greendale and precious few good ones, and the film around which they are built is truly simplistic and cringeworthy political sloganeing. Completely without merit as art and unimpressive as controversial, Greendale is best left to forget. Buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to Young's bank account.
