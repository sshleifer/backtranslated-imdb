A family moves to an old house in Japan. But there is a trick that is haunted (BOO !!!). Oh, I did not want to make you jump. It's just a criticism. Lie back. Now, anyway, he is haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife and his lover in slow motion. This of course causes a 3 minute scene to stretch to about 7 or 8. Horrendous acting. Horrible story. But how bad can it be you ask? Well, it was so bad that my brain began to melt and trickle down my nose in thoughtful drops. It was so bad every time Doug McClure came on the screen I prayed that I would have flashbacks from Small Wonder (Yeah, I know Doug was in "Out of this world" and not "small Wonder" but it's pretty much the same show, And I can sing the theme "little wonder" better) There are movies that are so bad they are good. this is not one of those <br /> <br /> Where I've seen: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My Note: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori gets topless, Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one naked, one topless only) <br /> <br />
