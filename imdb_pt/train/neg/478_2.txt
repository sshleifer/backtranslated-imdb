The competition for the worst Warner Bros. movie Kay Francis is tough. I've only seen maybe eight of them, but Comet on Broadway is the worst so far. The best thing is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly dresses (of course) are fine. The cinematography of James Wong Howe is not. Kay Francis everywhere looks fat and much less attractive than she usually does. Minna Gombell, whom I do not know, is good as a "semi-hard" burlesque dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than a burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her son (when the child knew that Kay Francis was his mother? I pissed?) Walking on a dirt road toward a prison painted in misty contours on a stage crash is beyond ridiculous. The whole film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism from everyone who did it: Warner Bros throwing garbage to those who do not know, in Warner Bros.'s cynical estimate, that what they are receiving is rubbish.
