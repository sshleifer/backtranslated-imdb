It would help to know why it took so long for a book as ready for the film as "The House Next Door" to be adapted for film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason could be trouble designing 'the house'. The house in this Lifetime movie is so ugly that I can not imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it once it was built. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about horror genre books, but this one was hard to release when I came around ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of person looking for something hidden in life, and that's one of the book's strengths. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was some kind of demon (or the devil personified) without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book. However, it's a pessimistic book for the most part, and I do not think it appeals to people who run Lifetime. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in the next few years. A better house ... better music ... better script and darker lighting ... would certainly help.
