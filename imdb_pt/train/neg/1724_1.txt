... and it's this movie. I imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, the doomed souls are tied to a very uncomfortable sofa and forced to watch this movie in a continuous loop for all eternity. Okay, maybe it's not so bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Hands, the Hands of Fate" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies, believe me . <br /> <br /> This is just a bad movie, a bad movie is better (or is it worse?) The thing that I really did not like about this movie is the double idiot they cast for comedy relief. Now a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the film is focused on the adventures of these two idiots, not the "heroes" of this movie, who are in it for less time than they! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a bad work edition. But honestly, this was probably a bad movie to start, so Crown really could not have done so much to hurt him. <br /> <br /> This really needs to be in the bottom 100 list. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's my kind of B-movie exaggerated. It was bad but I still enjoyed it despite my star rating.
