(some spoilers) - as if you did not know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - invisibility. All the premises of a great film were made. Unfortunately these things did not matter. The movie was very, very week, without suspense and terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> It's all about a group of scientists who discovered invisibility. After the animal tests were successful, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once it is invisible, it changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From there to the murder there is a very fine line. <br /> <br /> The hollow man is a sick movie. She suffers from the disease that many new movies have: special effects. From a challenging theme that could lead producers to a great psychological thriller, Verhoeven spoils everything by focusing only on special effects without giving a damn about the real value of the movie. I must admit, the fx are amazing, probably the best I've seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a good movie. In fact, that's the problem with the movies today. Like Verhoeven, most directors are concerned only with spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is ​​the only film that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot. <br /> <br /> After Star Troops, Verhoeven disappoints again. Instead of a big movie, HM is cr * p. There are only two reasons why you can watch this movie: 1. special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not ruin this moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, So what went wrong with the movie? All. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- You're not tense at all. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> It's very predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on the psychological side, Verhoeven cares only about the effects. <br /> <br /> - Many cliches. <br /> <br /> Of course the bandit wakes up a few times before he dies. <br /> <br /> As with all low quality horrors, the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible. Every time there's someone alone in the lab, Bacon's perfect victim. <br /> <br /> Some holes in the plot. Example: At first, Bacon needs to scan his finger to enter the lab. After he is invisible, how can he do that? <br /> <br /> --- The end: absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> After Shue hits Bacon on the head, Bacon falls to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. This is normal? Then Bacon rises, attacks, they "kill" him again. And then Shue yells "I heard an explosion" (happened minutes ago), and suddenly they run inside. Did not she hear this explosion some time before? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where you can see the microphones hanging above the actors. Come on, Mr. Verhoeven, I expected a lot more from you! <br /> <br /> So, this is about the Hollow Man. What should be a great movie turned into a farce. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (special effects)
