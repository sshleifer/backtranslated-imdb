I am 47 years old and have spent most of my life as I remember, a fan of horror and science fiction movies. If they are silent, black and white, no budget or large budget, there are very few of them that I can not find something to like. That said, I'll give credit to this movie for good effects of blood and creature, but that's all. This is a case of effects on history. The truth is we live in a time where there is very little that has not been seen in a horror movie. So for a movie of any kind really fun, it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad acting, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie does not even have good acting, only good effects. So, unless you can just about the blood, go through this.
