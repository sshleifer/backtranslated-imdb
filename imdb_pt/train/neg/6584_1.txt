Being the only film I could see at this year's "Nordische Filmtage" in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as the lowest of all time for me. <br /> <br /> This movie, which was heralded as an erotic thriller movie, is nothing but a fucking crap! Sorry for the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have rescued the film. For example. the plot: after the first 15 minutes it became clear that John was sick, the neighbors were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows through me has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately they were not the only disgusting images to be shown. Everything else was copied by other directors like, and. Lynch, but of course, without his genius. <br /> <br /> So to summarize the whole movie and save other viewers time and money: guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend comes home, guy kills girlfriend and gets angry later, guy imagines hot, but mad neighbor girls, dude has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes, he is crazy and his girlfriend and his new lover lie in his apartment all the time .. A bad story, bad actors, photos, that make you want to vomit ... 1 out of 10 (1 point because you realize how well you can understand Norwegian if you have learned Swedish - at least one benefit of the night - and you can not choose 0 points on here).
