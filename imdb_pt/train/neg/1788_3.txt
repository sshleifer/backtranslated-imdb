Giving credit where it is due, only the technicolor, costumes and scenery deserve any honorable mention. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the low point of BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The script is as clumsy as you could imagine and neither the casual Bing, nor William Bendix, nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it. <br/> <br/> Bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig. And poor Rhonda Fleming has a heroine role that requires her to look adoringly at Bing and little more than stammer out some uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion. <br /> <br /> Simply horrible! The wit of Mark Twain is not evident in any of the scripts. Only Crosby's stubborn fans can appreciate this confusion of a movie that has received an uninspired direction. Even the extras do not seem to know what they should do. <br /> <br /> In short: dull as dishwashing water. Not recommended, even for children.
