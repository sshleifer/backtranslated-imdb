I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. He then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is attacked by a bunch of strangers, and Dyer is beaten extremely badly while Anderson is raped. They then decide to take revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not. The story gets boring and side-tracked, and certain things get really weird. I will not give any details, but things happen that I, for example, do not feel like seeing. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like it. It just did not work. I give a 3 out of 10, mainly for the acting.
