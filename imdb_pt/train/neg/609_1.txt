This was an absolutely terrible movie. Do not be drawn to Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this should simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem the ridiculous plot of the film. This movie is a piece of American propaganda from the nineties. The most pathetic scenes were those in which the Colombian rebels were making their cases by revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso looked fake, and her pseudo love with Walken was nothing more than a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that had no real meaning. I'm disappointed there's movies like this, ruining the actor's name like Christopher Walken's. I could barely sit through it.
