Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. He's a kind of bad showman who can make you feel bad ... Very embarrassing. Nacho did some commercials on TV, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the commercial was about a collection of Mc Carney's CDs). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like the Nacho commercial: a bad plot, bad direction, and horrible performances. I can not believe a filthy movie like that was at The Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho could make this movie because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with the businessmen of Spanish TV.
