Despite being a big fan of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies, it was not until about 6 years ago that I first saw 'Follow the Fleet'. I knew all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers record (yes, vinyl), but I knew nothing of the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and the Ginger Rogers character is sweet and funny, you just can not like 'Baker Baker'. When trying to compensate his longtime partner, he continually sabotages his career. Your character does not have the usual mood and elan of the Astaire characters from the other movies. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the songs and a great solo touch routine from Ginger Rogers.
