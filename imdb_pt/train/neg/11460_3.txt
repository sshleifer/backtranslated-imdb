A very entertaining piece that tries to show how clever the Orcas are, but in the mean time (and totally unrelated to them) makes the audience feel stupid to make the film more ridiculous. Richard Harris plays Quint. I'm sorry, this is wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a living, but is attracted to the big fish and tries to catch a killer whale. When the capture of a female killer whale goes wrong (do not ask) is mate (do not ask) go in a riot (do not ask) and STALKING begins Captain Nolan (do not ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (do not ask). Very surprising to make movies here personal. I have to tell you though, the beginning (with the whales' noises and nothing else) is quite astonishing and the final credits (with the most wonderful song) are quite amusing.
