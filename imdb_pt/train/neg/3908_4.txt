There is enough stellar power in the HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, but the end product is quite debatable. The film and its messages are very noble, and I think perhaps most would agree with them. (Good Liberal Democracy, bad violent fascist regime, good open mind, bad racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we are struck from head to toe with these, and as much subtlety is used as I have described them. <br /> <br /> In the last analysis, we are observing very noble people, without any flaws, with nasty cretins who do not have redemptive qualities. It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated "pro" wrestling match. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as her talented bride and Glenn Close, as her sister-in-law. When the camera sits with these people, the film tends to move and is quite nice. Unfortunately, THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS gets involved with many subplots, and the characters appear and leave the scene as shooting targets. We do not know them, so we do not care about them. The result is boredom. If Bille August, the director and screenwriter (from the book by Isabel Allende), had prolonged the film or cut some characters, this movie could have worked completely. As it stands, it was a good try, with pleasant messages, and a bonecrushing yawnfest. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
