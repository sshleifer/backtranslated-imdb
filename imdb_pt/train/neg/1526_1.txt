I may have seen movies worse than that, but if I have, I do not remember. Or possibly blocked them. Who knows, if I were to undergo hypnotherapy, I might have remembered them perhaps, having been abducted by aliens as a child, or other traumas. If so, I'd be happy to exchange those memories for the ones I have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I must give some credit to the film: it produced an emotional response. I actually started getting mad at scenes that fooled other movies and TV shows, that this farce was messing them up by association. I'm terrified that I may be unable to watch movies like Dr. Strangelove again without this movie going through the eye of my mind.
