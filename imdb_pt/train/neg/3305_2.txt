I absolutely can not see what's funny in this movie. Humor seems destined for corpses. Is slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not raise much sympathy, some unimportant characters aside. Nothing surprising happens. What did the writers of this script think? "Oooo funny! Let's make a tall old lady in the pot! Let's make her .... laugh! Let's make her ... behave like children! Oooo, yes, this is absolutely brilliant and original!" <br /> This movie has irritated me most of all the movies that I have seen in the past five years.
