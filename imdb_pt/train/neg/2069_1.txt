I went to see this at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, OH, and - I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would have been a more reliable boxing fighter. <br /> <br /> A movie was painful, but seeing Bret Carr personally was seeing the desperation in its heyday. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie was to see BC hit his face with what appeared to be a "C" battery. The jury is still out of it. It was a vibrator and it was in slow motion. Yes. <br /> <br /> "Shoot the left side of the face only ... people become famous demanding things!" Bret Carr B. Carr wore a chicken suit for some reverse psychology, wandering the streets of Clifton banging on his own film. He should. This is correct to hit the movie. <br /> <br /> My soul felt angry after this movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult, or intelligent enough for that matter. This is the feeling you get from the bichosque of brain-warming, stunning neo-yuppies who came to see this work by Bret Carr. <br /> <br /> It's an emotionally exhausting experience just thinking about writing about this movie. , goodbye. <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
