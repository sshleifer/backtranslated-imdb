Salvage is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing remotely horrible about it. It does not deserve to be in such a fine genre. First of all I do not see how so many people can think of this piece of crap from such a good movie. If I wrote something so boring and utterly ridiculous as this, I would be ridiculed and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it. Second, the acting is terrible and the lead actress is painfully ugly. Third: History sucks, it's been used before, and the excuse that it's a cheap movie is no excuse. Read the summer on the back of the case, reveal the whole story. I do not recommend you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste something that will leave you wailing that you watched. I feel very bad for these thugs and the irony of their name. All hail Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
