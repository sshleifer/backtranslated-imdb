Universal Soldier: Return is not the worst movie of all time. No, that honor would have to go to a movie that tried to make some kind of statement or perform some artistic feat, but failed patently or offensive. However, perhaps no movie I have seen has tried so little and has been as successful as the Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a science fiction / action farce that pretty much has nothing to recommend it to. The acting is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. Special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone, even remotely attached to this film, should be ashamed of himself. USA: The Return makes previous editions of Van Damme look like innovative cinematographic masterpieces. Some movies are so bad they are good. Believe me when I say this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what else to say here. I doubt that many people were thinking of watching this movie if they did not, but just in case: no.
