Just good horror movie about a good suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement they continue to feed the people they catch on the street. Of course there is more to it than that, but to say more would be revealing. <br /> <br /> For me, it just did not come together because it tries to have two ways, both as family drama and horror. movie. The film struggles a lot to walk the front line between the two genres, but it seems more to stumble across the place as it tries to be shocking, something it really never is. It does not help that the final revelation is less of a scare than an "oh," as in "Oh, is that it?". Maybe if I had not watched so many horror movies recently, it might have been better or it might have seemed like I would not have compared it so much. <br /> <br /> I would take a pass
