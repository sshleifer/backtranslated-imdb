I go to the movies to have fun. There is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie. From beginning to end, there is no rest from the gray and grinding reality of this woman's life. It's a rhythm, with no change of mood. I stayed to the end only because I was convinced that things should get better. They do not, and I do not think I was the only one, as evidenced by the many moans around the movies as the film drew to a close. Honestly portraying social depravity is no crime, but boring the public is not the way to win the sympathy of the public. A terrible movie.
