This is the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen. DO NOT RENT! The creators of this movie must be bands to make another movie. It starts with a bit of a plot, then quickly disappears for nothing. I guess I'd rather watch paint dry then as much as looking at the cover. The actors were terrible, the plot disappeared quickly, filming to the left for much work to be done. Not a good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie, you will waste your money. I really like National Lampoon movies, but that was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to drive. I feel like I should process those holes that made this movie for wasted money in rental cost and lost time.
