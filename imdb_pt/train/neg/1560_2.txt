This movie can not even be said to be bad for this is unfortunately just painfully mediocre. Without any sagacity or real imagination, a fine plot is stretched to the absolute limit, and "jokes" (which are predictable and faint) are projected to such a hefty size that boredom and yawns quickly outstrip the viewer. Another point to mark John Waters' sad decline and a reminder that he "shocked" or amused us 30 years ago does not work the same way now. We have seen all this before, and this does not break any taboo anymore because they have evaporated long ago. A big fault.
