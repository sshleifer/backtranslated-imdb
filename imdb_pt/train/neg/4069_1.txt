Good God! (and this comes from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! <br /> <br /> Much has already been said by the reviewers before (those who evaluated this part 3 and below) with whom I totally agree, I would just like to add a few things: <br /> <br /> between the three guys who had to eat their own final digestive products, were stung by an Ax, raped by a broom handle, had their balls destroyed - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture by having to listen to the endless and meaningless babble of girl at the kitchen table (like us, but at least we have the clemency of the mute button). <br /> <br /> Director cut off the point and endless scenes of cemetery and inverted, our suffering would have ended after 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only things that made this movie at least a bit bearable are Emily Haack's tits (a dot). <br /> <br /> Forget it. do not buy. do not waste your time. and their sanity. my brain is so fried after watching this I feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer?) "Scrapbook" now.
