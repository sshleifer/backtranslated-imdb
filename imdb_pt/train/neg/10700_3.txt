The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - member of Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his novel with the character of Amelia Earhart played by Katherine Hepburn. Until they met, he was a very devoted husband, but when he met the odd but fascinating Hepburn, he "could not help it" and they fell in love. You can tell, because they look long into space and talk nonstop about how painful their unrequited love is. Frankly, this is a terribly dated movie and virtually impossible to watch. Part of the problem is that, on pre-coded days, movies that extol adultery were very common. Also, even if you accept this morally suspicious subject, the utter insolence of the dialogue makes it look like a 19th-century novel ... and very bad. Sticky and hard to like characters (after all, Clive's wife is a good girl and did no harm to anyone) make this a great waste of time. About the only interesting aspect of this movie is the costume that Hepburn uses in an early scene where she is dressed in a butterfly costume! You have to see it to believe it - and it looks like one of the Bugaloos (an obscure but appropriate reference).
