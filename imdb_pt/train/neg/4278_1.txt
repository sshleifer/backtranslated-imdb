I just got this movie for a buck from National Wholesale Liquidators, and after watching it, I felt like I was stolen. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I saw a movie worse than this. Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of a movie if I did not have such great respect for the subject, namely Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? Is it a musical biography? Yes, a lot of Foster's songs then interspersed here and there are those pseudo-Broadway-Jerome-type Kern numbers that smell more than the Mississippi Delta. I mean, was anyone paid to write this drivel? Second, the true story of Foster is fascinating. Why do not you come anywhere near that? Third, what do they have about the great Ray Middleton to make him do this movie? Pictures of him with little boys? With the Communists? What a waste of great talent. <br /> <br /> So, Foster's friends, and the truth, and good entertainment, be afraid ... be very, very, afraid.
