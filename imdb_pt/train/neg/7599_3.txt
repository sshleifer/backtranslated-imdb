A friend told me about John Fante last summer after we talked about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski - an author with airs and similar humor, except from a generation before. 'Ask the Dust' was Fante's first book I read and remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad and frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as a superconfiguring, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about real-world experiences he did not have. In the novel, the protagonist is a virgin, not knowing how to earn the graces of the women he desperately wants to write in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla as he sleeps for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer and how he ends up having nothing more than the story of his failed attempts to love is scathing and real without touching Hollywood's end. The film adaptation remains faithful to the book for a while, but it snakes in the cinematographic trap of persevering love through racism, disease and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is an idiot and Camilla is crazy, and her love never was and would never be the real thing, no matter how much they wanted to find each other. This movie ripped off the real meaning of the story and replaced it with schlock. I can not believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it all wrong.
