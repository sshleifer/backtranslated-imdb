At least I was able to enjoy the movie, which is surprising, since I barely got through it. In all honesty, my guess is that the DVD cover cost more than the entire movie. And saying he's the same director as The Boogeyman, when a new version of what just came out ... nice personal touch, was misleading enough to tie me. The only thing that frustrated me more than the copier's unbearable performance was his haircut. Normally, you only see this type of hair in a ten year old boy and the character acted like that. The film seems to have been filmed by a graduate student from some animated film school to use every film technique he learned while attending classes ... sometimes, less is more friend. From the outside I would get lost by random twists that led nowhere or were unexplained. All of this makes a bad movie, but when the end does not even come close to putting it together, it makes it an exceptionally bad movie. No doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and that includes the final French video of my friends for the senior year of high school, but hey, maybe I'm a bit biased, I mean, I got to do an extra. Q. I do not even think it deserves a star ... not even half. NO FOR YOU !!
