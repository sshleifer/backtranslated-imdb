Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood (or even live there), and these actors need to find another job. The most terrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just kept looking to see if it would improve what, unfortunately for me, did not happen. <br /> <br /> Even in the end, the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there were not many people behind the movie, so they had to roll the credits slowly ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a great guide "How not to make a movie". . Too bad I can not give a 0.
