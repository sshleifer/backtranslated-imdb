<br /> <br /> It's an unusual photo of Oliver Stone, but when I read that he was stoned during filming, I did not need any further explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a risky, crazy movie that we do not get too often; strange, psychotic and artistic images. <br /> <br /> 'Natural Assassins' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularized and glorified by the media; there's a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says "Murder is wrong ... but if I were a mass murderer, I would be Mickey and Mallory." Mickey describes this with a situation of 'Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein' - Dr. Frankenstein is the media that transformed them into these monstrous killers. <br /> <br /> Most of Oliver Stone's films examine the flaws of America, the country the director loves and admires. I think 'Natural Born Killers' is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive as a nation, Americans are (and most of the world) about things like mass murderers and bizarre situations. Murders played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are executed amazingly by two excellent actors who enter the lives of two murderers brutally. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worth killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (survival of the fittest) - Mickey says in his prison interview, that other species commit murders, we, as humans, devastate other species and exploit environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this movie amounts to making us think about society and human behavior, rather than the intensity of a 2-hour bloodbath we saw. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the movie takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of life in prison; the director's attitudes etc., over-prisons - maybe Stone is questioning the future, the path that society is leading to. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show about 'America's Maniacs' and is obsessed with increasing ratings, he does everything to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic, officer who is in love with Mallory - he also has a strange obsession with mass murderers, since his mother was killed during the Waco massacre by Charles Whitman. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is superb; different colors, shadows, styles create a sense of disorientation; The most obvious green color of all is green, to resemble the disease of the killers (at the pharmacy when they are looking for a rattlesnake antidote). <br /> <br /> Camera work is insane; unstable, buzzy, it takes some determination to use it and accept it. Highly heterodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> "Natural Born Killers" does not glamorize the existence of insane killers, question and how we as a public can feed this attribute ... <br /> Although the review The above seems pretty positive, I did not like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the screenplay for the film, was not satisfied with the altered script and asked for his name to be removed. I can see why. Although slightly interesting at times, the Natural Born Killers is a disaster. <br /> <br /> 4/10
