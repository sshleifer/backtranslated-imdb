When someone redo a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original. In addition, there is a chance that the remake will be so radically different that it is very unknown to the public. <br /> <br /> Well, the 1973 TV version of "Double Indemnity" has scenes and dialogs almost identical to those of the original 1944.. The main difference is that the remake seems to have no power at all. Fred MacMurray was great as insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna seems tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's boss, Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, an excellent actor, seems almost bored with the process. Samantha Eggar is wrong as Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was superb in this perverse role, Eggar is overly educated and educated and seems to be out of place. <br /> <br /> Robert Webber, in the former role of Richard Gaines as the boss of Robinson, Norton, and John Fiedler. Taking the role of Porter Hall as a crucial witness, bring some life to the film. In particular, Webber nicely recreates Norton's role in a 1970s context. However, after the movie starts, the whole thing simply stands there, with no life or electricity. This is a movie that should never have been redone.
