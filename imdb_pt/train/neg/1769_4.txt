(Dir-Mick Garris): Stephen King's movie with so many vampires and strangers has so many strange and funny elements that you start laughing at the extreme oddity about 3/4 of the way for the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a follower cult for King's fans. It is the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers (a form of a feline that changes shape, flesh, life, almost extinct, of humanoids) who move from city to city in search of virgins to stay alive. They come across normal upper-class people except they are secret lovers and cats are outside the house, day and night. Cats are deadly to them, so they put traps in their backyard to try to keep the population low. We begin to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack (which is also the first in my experience of going to the movies) - I hope no real cat has been harmed in the production of the film. The boy is behind a sweet girl that he has a fall until he turns into a "somnambulist" and then he just wants his body. There is so much uniqueness in this movie that it could have been better if it were a satirical comedy about suburban life, but the director tries to scare you every two minutes until you want him to get over it and bring the blood. Eventually this happens and the film reaches the typical Stephen King finale. The film is interesting because King's mood comes more than usual, but his strangeness is also very present and what you have is a movie that your fans will probably like and should have in your collection, but as a movie experience that It's worth it, cut it out.
