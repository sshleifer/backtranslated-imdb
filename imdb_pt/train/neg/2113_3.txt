The brides are dying on the altar and their corpses are disappearing. No one knows why or who, but an investigative reporter (Luana Walters) notes that every bride was using a strange orchid and will interview her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some weird habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the flow of young brides to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Disappears interesting premise and a short enough execution time that should not be able to get boring. Unfortunately, although it starts well, it begins to creep before the middle of the road and gets kind of boring with its clich√©s and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about it - Bela Lugosi is charming and fun. evil and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful countess, gentle, distant and very frightening; and I'm always Angelo Rossitto's fan. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> It maintains a bit of gothic atmosphere and the scenarios are decent. <br /> <br /> But overall, it just could not keep my interest through the whole picture, and for that, I have to rate it poorly.
