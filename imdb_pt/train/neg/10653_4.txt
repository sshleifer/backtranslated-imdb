One two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. This is a must see, first of all to see the work. There's a lot of work shown, see those closes, dude, you'll like it. A few years ago, a video clip was certainly based on that movie. It's a slasher but without suspense. The ending is also funny, and the clothes she's wearing on the wood, confronting the copper, Jesus, looks like a clown. The killings are made on most of the screen, blood flows, but it is never very bloody. There's a lot of fighting scene too, and no one got hurt. And on the gun to kill, never saw a big like this, will not ruin, you should see this. And being a slasher there's a lot of T & A too. To guess who the killer is, you'll get stuck a few times and that's the best part, but the copper story in the woods, huh! But still because of its tackiness this is still one that many would love to have. Glad to have my copy, one of those slasher glitches. But man, these clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are in your 40s, then this is one is back on track memory.
