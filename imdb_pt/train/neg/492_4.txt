If you stand behind the true story of the baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - however, if you are after a reasonably crafted fisiculturist with an art theme, you have discovered that it is a film. <br /> <br /> This film is such an imprecise representation of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi that it almost made me cry. (Write inaccuracies about Artemisia on Google and check out some of the facts vs. fiction articles.) From a purely technical point of view, the film was right: the scenarios, costumes, and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive beginning in the early seventeenth century. century experience; although the imprecise flagrant FACTUALS mentioned above have somewhat diminished. <br /> <br /> I wonder how the director / co-writer Agn√®s Merlet defended his film at the time? Maybe she would refuse to portray Artemisia as a victim, which would have been unfortunate, because let's face it, she was.
