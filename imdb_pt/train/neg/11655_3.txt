I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought "scary movie" although it is not a great movie was very good and funny. "Scary Movie 2", on the other hand, was boring, not funny, and sometimes stupid. <br /> <br /> The parody of the Exorcist / Amityville was probably the best part of the film. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit that I'm at a disadvantage, since I did not see some movies that parody unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some jokes that could have been good. Scenes and jokes creep to the end. <br /> <br /> In addition, the same jokes continue to be repeated over and over again. For example, the talking bird. Okay, it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept being repeated to the point of bothering. The routine between the wheelchair face and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but kept repeating and ended up stupid and tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes even repeated themselves in the first movie. For example, the 'creaming' I think you'd call Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in "Scary Movie" because Cindy was holding on giving her boyfriend for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he to 'believe'. But this time it was out of place and not funny. <br /> <br /> The bathroom and general sexual humor was more fun and well timed the first time around. The scat's humor was excessive and unnecessary in the second film. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in that movie. <br /> <br /> But I liked Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first movie. The scene with him and the marijuana plant was one of my favorites from the second film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and your mood. That's why this movie is so disappointing. . . they have much more comic skill than endless jokes.
