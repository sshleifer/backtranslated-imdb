As horror fans, we all know that blind rent sucks. Sometimes we find a real gem but we often find that the movie we just spent with our hard-earned money is nothing more than a putrid steam aggravated by the compliments and fest awards from movies listed on the box. Such is the case of Five Across the Eyes (a title I'm sure is a double meaning, referring to both the budget of the movies and the compulsion that anyone who is watching has to use all five fingers to pierce the eyes). <br /> <br /> The story, or at least what the writers think it is about, centers on a group of adolescent girls who recklessly decide to go for a late night stroll after leaving a football game a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fender-bender in a parking lot gas station. <br /> <br /> To be fair, it's an interesting idea. Some of the best horrors have very simple story lines. It is in the execution of Five Across the Eyes that this idea fails. The film attempts to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project, with its tremendous camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in its basic approach to the material, but manages to be one of the two. What we receive are redundant scenes of persecution, torture, deliverance; pursue torture, drop, in that order for 94 minutes, with long interludes of complaints, groans and inconsistencies, acting as a lot of filling between the chase sequences. <br /> <br /> The look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark, which in a better film could have heightened tension and realism. It's just boring here. The characters are not developed and the viewer is pressured to find anything that sympathizes with them. A character stops to pick up a first aid kit and faces some scratches on his face, while the shots heard in the background indicate that his friends may be being killed. Another girl grunts hilarious lines like "Do not go there, she'll get you, if she catches you, she'll kill you and if she kills you, you're dead." <br /> <br /> It was a compliment from Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed in the box that forced me to check this out. Talk about a fake orgasm! Maybe my expectations would have been met if that were in the comedy section. I'm all for low budget indie horror, but this one takes the crap cake.
