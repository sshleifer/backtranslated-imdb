(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the term loosely) that I have been trying to watch for over a year. I finally came to an end and now I wish I did not put the effort repeated. <br /> <br /> In an effort to save two hours of your life I'll tell you what he plot. A guy who has the ability to project a long blade of his arm back home to see his mother. Things get ugly after he gets beat up by an old girlfriend's mafia boyfriend. He takes revenge on the guy when he takes the girl home. The mafia mafia sends its men to take revenge, while the policemen begin to look for it also. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. No explanation is actually given for anything (such as why they lock girlfriend id in an asylum) and the action, for the most part it's all off the screen. The film essentially consists of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody looking intense and not saying anything, killing people (off-screen - most of the action happens off-screen). It looks good, is well represented and if there was any reason for what is happening, it could have been a good movie. Hell, I would have liked some sense of real character development or a story behind (all we know is that the guy was chosen as a kid). The movie spends most of the two hours and looks like it's six. If they did not tell us anything, they could have at least accelerated the pace, so it seemed like it was going too fast. No, instead, we took the hero on a boat. The hero in a bus, the hero walking, the hero looking disturbed. Hero with your girl. That really bothered me, since I think this might have been a good movie if they had simply done something or someone had actually said something meaningful besides giving instructions to "get this guy". <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 Its about four o'clock (all my attempts to see this) I will never go back. Only for those who want to see a Russian action movie with very little action
