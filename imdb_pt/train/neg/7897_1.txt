This movie was made for people who found Gremlins very serious and Critters for hardcore. Like many of the 80's creatures / trolls / gremlins movies, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is no joke for this comment. It's just bad and not in a funny way. The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being as successful at doing this as Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A. Man. What made the other 80s horror films into classics was that they were really trying to be scary, but they were hilarious because they failed so miserably. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes, A Bettina Hirsch) that she had a way of comedy before starting to direct that film. Unfortunately, they were wrong. Of course seeing a strange mutant crossing between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown overcoat and throwing billiard balls at a Lost Boys parade is fun but not enough to save the movie. By far the most annoying part of the movie is Paul's character. Your Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start moving from the time of your first scene to the final credits, stopping only once to see a scene in which a munchie throws billiard balls at a guy ... not that I did it. Then the bottom line runs, do not walk, to the nearest Blockbuster and shake the manager's hand and thank him for not having the grapes to stock that pile of garbage on the shelves.
