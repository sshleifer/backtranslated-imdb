In a way, the concept behind the plot was a rather interesting mix of various types of typical films in an interesting combination. However, no point in this film was so obvious that it did not deserve prolonged close-up shots. I felt as if I had been beaten in the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to have simply raised cliches from other films as a substitute for writing adapted lines. for real characters. The actors did not help at all. No chemistry. I think they should develop some kind of attraction, just because that is an essential element of these stories. However, writers did not work hard to develop chemistry. Of course, both are attractive, but if they are attractive to each other, it seems to be an open question. <br /> <br /> The confidence that Turner's character shows in Sabato is developed very quickly and for no particular reason. Sabato's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who simply can not play by the rules. Think of Jeff Goldblum's character in "Independence Day." Typically, this type of character must demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance. The character of Sabato does not. He is Cassandra with only the madman and all the prophetic abilities of an eight magic ball. He seems to be right by chance. <br /> <br /> The death scenes are comical. Each actor was really trying more than a little to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them. The symptoms seemed like a bad claymation, more or less like that 80's video, Peter Gabriel, I think.
