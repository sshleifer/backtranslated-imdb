Blue Monkey (1987) or 'Invasion of the BodySuckers', as it is known here in the UK, was a very annoying horror film about an old man who is bitten in a greenhouse by a mysterious toxic plant !!!! The man is rushed to the hospital, where this worm-like creature comes out of his mouth, of course this turns into this insect monster and goes on in agitation! Although Steve Railsback and John Vernon are in the movie, I found it boring, with a predictable plot plot, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action !!!! Horror fans do not really need to keep up with this weird movie, you will not miss much confidence in me !!! I give this movie 2/10.
