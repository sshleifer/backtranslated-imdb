Invasion of Star Creatures would definitely be in the "so bad it's good" category if the film was not so sexist or racist. That is so, it simply makes this very bad. <br /> <br /> It has the same kind of stereotyped hard-line sexism you saw in the Queen of Outer Space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this case, Native Americans). which you would normally find in b-westerns from the thirties and forties. In terms of being non-funny, the same gag walking through the cave is repeated over ten times during the course of this rather short film. Ray makes a good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but he can not make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row, nor deal with a Peter Lorre when he tries). There's really no production value to speak of, since the "Star Creatures" make the Robot Monster Ro-Man or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 of the Outer Space look like creations of Industrial Light and Magic. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call independent early cinema ... not artistic enough for these theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of a drive -in all night long. /> <br />
