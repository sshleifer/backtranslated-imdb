It was great to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked wonderful. But that was it. They received no characters or good lines to work with. I did not understand or care what the characters were doing. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were good, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small parts of partners. They showed some talent and it's sad that they did not continue to star in more and better movies. Unfortunately, I do not think Dorothy Stratten has had a chance to perform in this one-of-a-kind movie role. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to have a few fans, and I was very open when I started watching. . I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his last film, "Cat's Meow" and all his first since "Targets" to "Nickleodeon". So it really surprised me that I could barely stay awake watching this. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where detectives and clients engage romantically with one another. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd, had a hit series called "Moonlighting" stealing the idea of ​​Bogdanovich's story. Of course, there was a big difference in that the series was based on tons of witty dialogues, meanwhile it tries to turn with slapstick and some crazy speeches. <br /> <br /> In short: it's nothing "Paper Moon" and just a very pale version of "What's Up, Doc".
