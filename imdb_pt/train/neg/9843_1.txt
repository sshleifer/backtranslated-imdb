It's just Robert De Niro's movie that I really hate. It's a stupid movie with horrible acting (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma should make his mafia films as usual, like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved the Mission of De Palma: Impossible (1996). De Niro also worked with Palma in two different moments, Salutations and Wedding Feast. I thought The Wedding Party was OK too (I did not watch Greetings). <br /> <br /> The script is really bad and bland. There's no scene I can smile at once. The movie missed the chance to be a funny style, even a little bit in a "Be Black Baby" scene, and I also do not like the scene where a guy's sex organ appeared. So it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! only the worst. I hate that.
