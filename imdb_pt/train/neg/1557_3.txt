The film is basically a boring series of terrible cliches that do not offer a real cross-cultural vision. The Middle East part of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: there are obviously mud brick villages, dirt trails in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how camels and date palms lost the whole picture. The personality of the two main characters is sketched very clumsily and many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea may have been interesting, but at the end of the day, if you're looking for a cultural insight, you should skip this movie.
