This is another one of those movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal people who kill to live, etc. - a kind of variation of the vampire concept. <br /> <br /> What makes it all crumble is the total recklessness of the main characters. . Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - see how long it took to get Unibomber, and it was because a family member discovered that. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the boy (and to a lesser extent the mother) behave as if they were untouchable. The kid kills without thinking for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness. How these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable, let alone decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame - this could have been a lot more if it had been written plausibly, meaning giving the main characters the level of common sense they would need to survive for so long. <br /> <br /> Other than that, it's not a bad presentation. I loved the part at the end where all the city cats converge on the house - every time I put food on the porch and see our cats suddenly coming from wherever they were before, I think of that scene.
