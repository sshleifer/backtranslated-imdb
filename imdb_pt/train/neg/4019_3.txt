Dakota (1988) was another vehicle starring Lou Diamond Phillips. This movie is similar to the movie released later Harley. There are some differences, but both are the same. I do not know which came first. I think it will continue to be one of the mysteries of life. But the two are troubled "boys" who are trying to transform their lives. Instead of bicycles, this involves horses. They are basically the same movie and both are extravagant as hell. If you're a L.D.P. fan, so I recommend you watch both. You get some assaults and extreme postures from L.D.P. If you are a game, then go ahead. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except L.D.P. fans !!!
