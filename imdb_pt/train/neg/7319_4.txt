when you get to the scenes involving Albert Brooks without your shirt ... try not to choke on a ball of fur. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I've seen most, if not all of his movies, but it was the first time I saw this. Modern romance is an interesting approach on the subject of love. There are few movies that deal with the despair of love as well or as openly as the modern novel, although the film Chilly Winter Scenes of 1979 comes very close. Both essentially deal with obsessed men who are psychologically attracted / obsessed by their respective women. <br /> <br /> While the film Chilly Winter Scenes approaches the subject, this film has a more grounded base on the subject. of love because both people are already in a relationship .. and out of relationship .. and back in it again <br /> <br /> And because it's a movie that was released in 1981, it's turn in terms of styles and such. That's the main reason why I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is "If it's crap at least, it may have some historical relevance," you know the material of the time capsule. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the hideous scenes of Albert Brooks without a shirt. <br /> <br /> The man is hair. Too much hair. As if he were wearing a black sweater with furry curly fur. And the worst is that he almost seems to burn victim-hairy. It is not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him shirtless continue. In the early 1980s, hairy men were seen as normal and not at all shocking. But in 2009, the sight of something like that is simply disgusting. Sorry, Albert! I wish somebody would say, "Hey, let's try this scene, but with you wearing a simple T-shirt, I mean you can scare people." It's really really bad and I'm sorry for the poor actress who had to deal with Albert Brook's naked body on top of her. She was probably pulling her hair out of her teeth for days after that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's an OK movie. It could have been better if I had not seen Albert Brooks without his shirt so it seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will smear my view of that movie forever.
