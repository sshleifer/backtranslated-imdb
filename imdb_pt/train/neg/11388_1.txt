This story is about the romantic triangle between an umpteenth. African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waitress who does not speak French and who never seems to shave. Like a movie, it is monotonous, somber and depressing, filmed in both mist and mist. winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everyone is bathed in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance was out. Everyone is pale and dejected and looks dejected, beaten and dirty. The bodies are bony and shot in such a way that they look very ugly and unpleasant. Moles, oily hair. Yuk Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. All three characters return to Stephanie's hometown, where, through a bunch of flashbacks to the desolate countryside and predictably dirty interiors, we see a bit of Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre. The mother dies. Well ... and that's about it, really. The development of the character is kept to a minimum, as is the outcome of the story. <br /> <br /> I suppose the plot is not linear (this would explain many non sequiturs), but in fact, after paying my seven euros, I do not feel like building the movie: this is what the director takes my money to Expecting me to join the storytelling process and get my hands dirty, so to speak, is to ask too much. <br /> <br /> This film is a heap of pretentious garbage made, above all, of a desire for epater les bourgeois (ie, hatching the straight). I can see what a shoo-in was for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it came to nothing.
