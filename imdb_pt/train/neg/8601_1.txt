Ok, where do we start with this little jewel? Mutant slugs begin to take over a small New England town. Only one man can stop them ... and this man ... it's Mike Brady! Now, if that was not laughable enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> Filming of the slugs is known as stock footage. No matter who the slugs attack or where they are, the same shot of piles of slugs sliding everywhere is shown. Keep in mind that this unique scene occupies at least half of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting in the movie was to knock down, drag out, steal your wallet, punch your girlfriend, kill your dog, BAD. I'm sure it's worse, but you're going to have a hard time finding it. The only jewel was ... you guessed it ... MIKE BRADY! He must have had some night classes at the YMCA because he was the best of the group. <br /> <br /> What about the horror? This movie should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They are slugs for crying aloud. All the rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two. Just watch this movie in an MST3K-like environment, otherwise I can see some great damage to the brain.
