After watching Awake, I came to the conclusion: the director and screenwriter Joby Harold did the Awakening with the intention of laughing at the viewer, simply because the film was full of ridiculous elements. The Awaken has many holes and is full of absurd and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital uniform that the spirit of the main character uses ... the ghost of a doctor left him on the floor?). The concept behind this movie is a bit resourceful, but all the holes in the plot and absurd things make this a stupid, low-quality movie. With the exception of the great Lena Olin, all the actors bring bad performances. Hayden Christensen has zero expressions and the same applies to Jessica Alba. Terrence Howard is terribly lost in his life. role.Awake makes a spectator laugh. It's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it's impossible to take it seriously. My recommendation is: skip this low quality movie.
