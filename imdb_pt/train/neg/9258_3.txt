It's a shame that someone has decided on the best horror movies of all time in my book. This poor copy steals a lot of material from the first three movies going even copying how people die and what will happen in the future with the main characters and basically tries to cram in three movies in one and fails. He failed to even create a scary atmosphere for one (except with the strange exception in which the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can thank is that it was not an Omen V.
