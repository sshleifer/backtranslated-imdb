this show is one of the worst shows EVERY TIME! absolutely no original joke and they are always a year late. as in 2009, they will finally tell you something about Michael Vick's fights. all the cast members are people who wanted to be in the SNL, but they had to go to the low, crazy TV. An hour of jokes from crazy magazines are not funny to begin with, told by the terrible John Stewart wants bees. so if you have any problems tell me that I love hearing the opinion of the 3 people who watch this show. A family guy put it well "Osama bin Laden was hiding in a place that no one would look at, the crazy TV cast. There is a reason why no one watches the show.
