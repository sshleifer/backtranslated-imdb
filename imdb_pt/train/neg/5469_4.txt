This film may have weak production values, but it is also what makes it so good. The special effects are gross and well made. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good scene of nudity. Robert Prichard as the gang leader is hilarious, as are the other members. This film is really trying to make a point, saying that nuclear waste is bad. 4/10 Comedy fair, rough movie.
