I saw the trailer for this movie and it looked great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, the acting is chaos, the special effects (if you could call them that) look like something that would not be out of place in a school play. Some of the characters are so stupid in this movie that you will shrink the minute they are onscreen, which unfortunately is very frequent. As for a story, forget it. This is a warning, do not waste any money on this movie, it has to be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If for some reason you like this movie, watch Troll 2 and you'll probably like it too.
