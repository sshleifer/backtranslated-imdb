Certainly not horrible, but definitely not good. Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from Alan Paton's 1946 novel). Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about pre-Apartheid in South Africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man entwining. The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; He later discovers that his son killed a man. Rich landowner / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) learns that his son, a black rights fighter, was murdered by Kumalo's son. In this they connect. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, because I did not see it. Or the 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars, because I did not see it either; both look better than this. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I've seen; has a much more urgent air, as if trying to say something where the movie Cry, The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it's headed. Very "Wishy-washy". I refuse to compare the film with the novel (except that I like the novel more than the film), because novels and films are two extremely different mediums and there is no sense in trying to transfer directly to one another, the through the same means. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie has spoiled. Well, I guess it was not so bad, - five - out of ten, - but it was not that good. Both actors, both very capable actors, performed some of the most lively performances I've seen with some of the strangest dialogues in film history (but this can be attributed to screenwriter Ronald Harwood, who is also strangely out of the picture with this film, having also written the sublime The Pianist, and Being Julia). Among other things, the point and themes of the novel are almost totally lost in its transition to the cinema for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racial or suspenseful. Music does not help. The tracks of the painfully misplaced and boring pastoral orchestra really help with this dullness of the movie. A good thing is cinematography, with many good or great plans, but unfortunately, that does not help much the film. <br /> <br /> The last words of Alan Paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. the film. It's a shame that they seem so disconnected from the movie that has just been shown. I do not know what Nelson Mandela could have seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
