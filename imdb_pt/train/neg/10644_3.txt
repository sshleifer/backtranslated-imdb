Well, here's one more role-reversal movie. There were many worth watching, despite the tired plot of gender inversion. However, this is not it. In previous reviews, I think I made my point about the general decline of pleasure for Haim movies that followed the late 80's. This is one of them. 'Just One of the Girls' is about a high school boy (Corey Haim) who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleading team and befriends fellow cheerleader Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can not keep the charade much longer. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was crap, and it was not even funny. But judging by most of the comments, it seems that fans of Alanis Morrisette or teenage queen Nicole Eggert are the only ones who would like to watch this. If you're looking for a good Haim feature (or role-playing comedy), look no further than 1989. That's where Haim's career plummeted.
