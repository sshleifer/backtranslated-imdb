I'm surprised that everyone (even critics) seem to think this was a good movie. It was the most clich√©d thriller ever made that I have ever seen. We have the 'villain' who wants to force the 'good guy' (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequence. The "good girl" in this movie must use their knowledge and skills to defeat the "villain" and save the day and their loved ones. Using charisma, bravery and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? Well, a young lady named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (legal name) at an airport. One coincidence leads to another and it soon seems that fate is bringing those two together. Sharing drinks, sitting side by side, seemingly getting along in every way ... Is there more in this strangeness? Could these two be made for each other? Does 'fate' have a reason for the strange and random encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turns out, unfortunately yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him assassinate the Director of Homeland Security, moving him from one room to another so his men can launch an attack on him. Oh, if she does not, her father is dead. Although we never know the exact reasons and why who really is behind this madness, Jackson more than explains how this will happen and why it is in Lisa's interest to help him. <br /> <br /> Of course Lisa defeats. his evil plans with his smarts and in the process stab him in the neck, make him stumble into chairs and hit him with a field hockey stick. Ah, and before that, she takes him in a wild chase through Miami airport, where she passes after the 11th security and steals a car she uses later to run over the man who was sentenced to kill her father. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> First off, I find it strange that a man like Jackson, who can get his hands on high tech weapons, needs the help of a hotel manager. Could not he just put a bomb in the building? Would not that make it safer for him and his team, leaving out third parties? And why characters like Jackson also explain everything they're going to do with someone they're threatening? Does not that make it easier for them to stop them? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best considering the film they received. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to be sought after. Also, I believe that Jayma Mays (who played the 'lovable' Cynthia) will be someone we will see more. It's too bad that they were all stuck with it. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
