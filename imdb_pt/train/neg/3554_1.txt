I rented this back in the 80's and honestly I do not remember anything specific about the movie - it's just the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was funny". This is not one of those films "it was so bloody, it leaves you with a bad feeling". It was not even one of those "what the hell was that?" movies. I do not remember the performance of the actors, but it was poorly filmed, the story was disjointed and did not have a definite style. When it was over, I was angry that I wasted my time. <br /> <br /> I saw many films that I did not understand because of cultures, styles and / or unknown stories, but it was clear that these films had some of these properties. The incubus has none. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought NOT to comment on this "piece" for fear someone might watch it out of curiosity, but I am obliged to warn anyone who enjoys the film to skip this movie. .
