The name "cult movie" is often given to movies that continue to be shown or sold in home movie format, more than a generation after being released for the first time. Superchick, which was released in 1973, now falls into this category. Her cult status is largely due to continued interest in those women who consider her an early and effective feminist film. <br /> <br /> Despite the connotation of "Superwoman", "Superchick" is not a cartoon character, but a very competent young man working as a stewardess - a career choice that in the 1970s was commonly considered one of the most glamorous for any girl, and that also allows her to imitate the traditional matelot that supposedly has a wife in each port. Since she holds black belt status in karate, she is in a position to make it clear that she is very happy with her bachelorship, and is in no way attached to any of her large male admirers. This film is a situation comedy that avoids the generally much shorter appeal of farce. Her appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate skills to avoid kidnapping and save all other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film will please both men and their partners, the Director wisely assured that he is liberally sprinkled with eye drops. <br /> <br /> Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not very critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy that they will soon forget after watching. It is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if they are assisted again in a year; despite his age, can therefore maintain his cult movie status for some time. However, dialogue and acting make it difficult to rate this film by more than 4/10.
