The zombie revolt has no redeeming features. I am tired of people arguing that it is not so bad, and that the effects must have been stronger in 1936. I suspect this is not true: it is not as if IQ has increased dramatically in the last 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably as bored with this rubbish as the average viewer these days. Because? Just try to watch the first scenes and count the breaks between things that happen, the terrible choice of when to cut to close, the careless issue that seems to include two extra seconds in each photo to fill the runtime. Pay attention to the extremely redundant dialogue: "I'm going to make tea / go outside / read my book now". "You're?" "Yes I am." This type of exchange happens several times. Usually I would love this, be a big fan of bad movies, but watch the indifferent actors murmuring their banal and tedious sentences, and every desire to laugh at the movie slowly disappears. This kind of disinterested and flustered waste of time is far worse than energetically imaginative, such as Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. Those who claim that this is "better" than the more interesting films have an idea of ​​entertainment behind. This film is not bad in the sense that his jaw is open in wonder: it is bad in the sense that his eyes slowly close in boredom. Which is much worse.
