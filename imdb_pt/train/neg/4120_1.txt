Absolutely horrible movie. Ameteurish and not funny at all. The main character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. The editions of E.T and star wars are simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good thinker in this movie. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities. Besides Goksal, this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic book writer and this movie is his worst writing work yet. <br /> <br /> Cem Karaca's music is yet another of this waste of money. The actor Sumer Tilmac also has some presence. Actor who plays the three children has no talent what ever.
