The peloton is for the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is for heavyweight champion boxing. Oliver Stone's story about the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so exaggerated that it is laughable. Although most or all occurrences in Platoon have occurred over more than 10 years of US military involvement in Vietnam, portraying these things happening to a small group of men in such a short time (weeks) gives a terribly distorted image of war. In Platoon, platoon men see the following in a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US soldiers raping civilians, a US sergeant killing another US sergeant, an American soldier killing a US sergeant. soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire, 90% + dead or wounded in the platoon. For Stone, trying to pass this film on as the typical American soldier experience in Vietnam is a shame. Two Vietnam War movies that I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of possibly the worst battle for American soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's Bright Shining Lie.
