I found the movie offensive to Americans who lost someone in the towers, to the American people at large. Pretending to be a tribute to the horrific facts of recent years, each director seizes the opportunity to argue with old facts (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack), or criticize American political behavior, or compare different political situations like themselves country that has nothing to do or share with the atrocity of September 11. Shame on them.
