how can this movie have a 5.5 this movie was a piece of skunk s ** t. first the actors were really bad, I mean Charlie was so retarded. because in the beginning, when he stuck his head in the wooden hut (which was about a quarter of an inch thick (which really was cheap as * fragile piece of wood) and he did not even think he could cut it) second, the The person who made the set is a drug to provide things for them to build. The only good thing about this movie is the idea of ​​this t.v. exhibition. bottom line DO NOT waste your hard earned money on this piece of shit they call the movie. <br /> <br /> rating: 0.3
