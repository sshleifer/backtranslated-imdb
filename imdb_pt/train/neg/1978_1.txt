Pathetic is the word. Bad acting, pathetic script, shocking dialogue and hip hop music and fashion ... what the hell was going on? The director of this movie acts as badly as the movie he made. If it had taken some time and effort to redo the whole thing, maybe he had a chance. I bet the studios are still trying to figure out how they could screw up so much. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... the Asian girl was not that bad either. These girls also carried the whole movie. If it were not for them, I would have destroyed my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If any of you have not seen it yet and have an idea, do not waste your time ... you will only regret it later.
