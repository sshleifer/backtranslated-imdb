I saw this in the market at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a very cheap product - nothing wrong with that, but you have to make up for it with a little sex or blood, or both. <br /> <br /> Think about Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to producers for sticking it, I think. <br /> <br /> The opening scene of the spacecraft is hilarious - you could imagine all the team hands shaking around! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish the people who did it well - at least it is not pretentious.
