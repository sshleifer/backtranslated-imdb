The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a label given to the Senator, which was based on the public's ignorance about World War II aircraft. The rearward-facing moving guns depended on a latch that would prevent the rear shooter from firing at the tail of the plane, preventing the gun from firing when it pointed to the tail. When the senator was practicing on the ground one day, he managed to shoot the tail of the plane. He could not have done it if the gun had been properly aligned. The artillery officer responsible for this admitted in public, in front of a camera, that he was responsible - he had made the mistake, not the senator. The fact that the film does not report this fact shows how unilateral it is. This movie was designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was the PBS special made for him. He was an ambitious, hard-working and ambitious politician who overcame the extraordinary disadvantages of reaching extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shooting at the tail of an airplane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories, a = side stories, so they do not have to think.
