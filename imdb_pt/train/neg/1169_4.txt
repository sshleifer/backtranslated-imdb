As interesting as a sheet of cardboard, this piece of the dispensable period has little use. It is too wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real-life characters must have felt when they shied away from the fickle hand of the justice of the French Revolution. Eric Rohmer in '82? It shows.
