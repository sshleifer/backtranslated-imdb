This could be a strong contender for "The Worst Flick Ever". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, this could be tolerated as a children's movie. However, the TRAGEDY of all this effort, is that John Hurt, one of the biggest actors of the screen, reduces to this ... I gave two points just because Mr. Hurt showed me ... I shot 8 points because it did not run fast enough. As for the rest of the cast, they are just terrible. Janine Turner, as beautiful as she is, can not act to save her soul. And the lead actor is, for all intents and purposes, AWFUL. If you can spare yourself of this embarrassment, do so. It's so bad it almost hurts.
