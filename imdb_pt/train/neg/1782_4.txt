A lovely boy and his mother move into the middle of nowhere, cats and death soon follow. That sums it all up. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm a bit scared of cats after watching this movie. But in all seriousness, despite the countless things that are wrong with this movie, and believe me, there are plenty of things to do, it's a very enjoyable viewing experience. <br /> <br /> The characters are more like caricatures here with just their basic instincts to trust. Fear, greed, pride, lust, or anger seem to be all that motivates these people. While it may be argued that this apparent failure actually serves to tell the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a screenplay by Stephen King (not that I have something specific against Mr. King) are very well supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite adequate music. The gem of this film is undoubtedly Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the mother of another world. <br /> <br /> King manages to have a simple story of someone from outside, or people who are a bit different (okay - one in this case), trying to fit in and turn it into a little gem of horror that must be in the collection of any horror fan.
