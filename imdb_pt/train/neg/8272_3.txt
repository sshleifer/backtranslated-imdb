At the end of "Dragon Heat" all I could think about was why I bothered to sit with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is interesting and this - like Maggie Q - is what attracted me. to the film first. But I was disappointed. Writer and director Daniel Lee can not keep an eye on names like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Lee is so engrossed in his visual style - and I use that incredibly loose phrase - that he fills the film with totally unnecessary black-and-white stills, freeze frames, slow motion, fast motion and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did all this to make up for the lack of a good story or a dialogue. <br /> <br /> Action scenes are nothing special and play like a music video more lively than anything else. There is little to worry about any of the characters - including two supposedly professional shooters who could not reach the wider side of a barn inside! - who are then charged with some of the most cheeky dialogues I have ever seen in one of these Hong Kong action agents. <br /> <br /> The plot is devoid of twists - from the initial setup, everything unfolds into predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters' stories if we do not get the first few times. This is very amateurish writing and making movies and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although, to be blunt, I'm hard-pressed to remind Biehn to be in any good movie that has not been directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a great actioner in Hong Kong, you'd better stick with some of the basics - John Woo's "The Killer" (1989) and "Hard-Boiled" (1992) "City on Fire" by Ringo Lam (1987) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) - or his remake "Point Blank" (1967), "Full Contact" (1992). Or, even check out Yuen "So Close" (2002), an extremely entertaining but absurd popcorn movie. And there is always the tremendous French police act, "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> It is true that most, if not all, are a little overdone, but they were still exciting, thrilling and even suspenseful films. They have characters we care about and mind-boggling sequences of action. <br /> <br /> "Dragon Heat", on the other hand, is terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee did not make a bad action movie, he made it a bummer.
