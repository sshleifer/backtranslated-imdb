There are people out there who will light up everything! That's the only explanation I can give you about why the House of the Dead movie exists. And that's just a scary part for the whole movie. It's so bad you're going to leave the movies forever. I really wanted to turn this off and turn the TV to the Paint Drying channel, but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I do not know why I do these bad things to myself. <br /> <br /> As if that matters, here is the basics of 'history'. A group of people in their mid-twenties is so desperate to go to some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada, actually because it's cheap) for the 'Rave of the Century' (consisting of about 8 people and music delusional) that they pay some old, steep $ 1000 fishermen to take them there after they miss the main ferry. This has to be a delight to be worth all that mass! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Island of the Dead (hold on - I thought it was THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD?) And that they are all doomed yadda yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> First Faults Here. Why would a tiny rave (of the century my foot!) Be kept on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay a lot of money to get it? Why pay even more for the old fisherman to take them back when they could get back with the others? <br /> <br /> When they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been destroyed, there is blood everywhere and no one is around. What would any rational thinking person do? Run for your lives, of course. But no, these ignorant, obviously blind, decide to look for them. Soon they discover an old house falling apart, 50 times bigger than outside. Another half hour of stumbling in the woods follows, as an excuse to kill some of the smaller characters, and after much boredom they return to the house again. The characters, like the movie, get nowhere. <br /> <br /> Jammed for this horrible disaster is an overabundance of meaningless dialogue, hideous acting, mumbo-jumbo exposure and zillions of once-popular arcade game clips of the same name. Why this was universally accepted as a good idea for the filmmakers that I will never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and only degrade that trash further, if that is possible. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the game, except for a cheap and disposable line in the game. end. This makes Resident Evil look like cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie looks like multi-Oscar worthy compared to this crap. The only thing that comes out of this with its dignity still intact is Jurgen Prochnow. He could have just taken his money and run, but he tries his best with the horrible script and brings a little bit of excitement to his character. The rest of the cast is scared. The characters are stupid and deserve to die. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you cut the nonsense nonsense and nonsense, I see no reason why this movie can not be screened on Saturday morning's TV. It's not scary at all. Pirates of the Caribbean is scarier than the skeletal thugs in this movie. And where did all these bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I think this justifies the reason why they chose to reuse the images over and over again. I'm not joking, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Who is to blame for the scandalous waste of celluloid? None other than director Uwe Boll. His control over the film is nonexistent. You can clearly see the actors have no idea what they should be doing and that the zombies are not really taking it all seriously. The actors seem to be reading the tips cards as they stop constantly in the middle of long phrases and keep talking as soon as they see the next card. Everything seems very unnatural. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is shot as a two-part miniseries. I've seen better TV productions. And do not get me started editing. The film is an incoherent babbling with thousands and thousands of nonsense photos and dozens of tasteless camera pans. No real skill or talent was put into doing this. This really confuses and confuses the mind about how such bad movies can be made and George A. Romero can not get anyone to answer his calls. House of the Dead makes some idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be 'postmodern', but only annoyed that they think this is on the same level as a real zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Well worth it, the anamorphic image of 1.85: 1 looks great and the soundtrack of Dolby 5.1 is clean, but very unimpressive and only serves to pronounce even more widely used ADR. The DVD comes with extras, but why torture yourself? Is not this criticism enough? To stay away! You're all damned, I tell you! Condemned! Condemned !!!
