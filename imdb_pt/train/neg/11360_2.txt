Okay, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies being thrown aboard Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give artists the support to do their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and launching hardware were on. The graphics in general were very good - launching the rocket gave me chills, as a good rocket launch always does (my motorblood of popular Mechanics cars remains strong) and 3D was quite effective. The CG was not from Pixar, but it was generally good. The flies were mediocre half-anthropomorphic, with some half-gone characters from the late 1960s coloring (hippie flies, African American flies with gigantic afro and black shadows, etc.) and larvae resembled human baby larvae. screenwriters certainly did not do their homework, counting on offensive and outdated clich√©s (60's gender policy, including largely unhelpful female characters, racial stereotypes, perverse Russians, fat flies who just want to eat, gross-out humor level In an IMAX-oriented movie, they opened up a wonderful opportunity to introduce some educational content on physics and space travel - did they not get the correct physics (zero-g in the Lunar Module during landing? PLEASE. ) They did not even bother to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts, all in the public domain, they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like crap. <br /> <br /> But we like the worms. <br /> <br /> So, they gain a point and a half for rockets and worms. Yes. 1.5 / 5.
