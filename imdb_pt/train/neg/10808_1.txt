I was given the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday, and people always say that the book versions are always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least the movie will be over soon. <br /> <br /> The acting in this is terrible, what I expected from a movie with Shaq that plays a magic rap genie that comes from an old ghetto blaster (that there was probably a good reason he was stuck in there ). The boy in the movie who plays Max is a crybaby and a terrible actor. He is bullied by neighborhood kids, who do not blame them because he's an idiot. <br /> <br /> The story is just stupid and extremely clich√©. About a boy whose father is always working and never around, he finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps reconnect with his father. <br /> <br /> Even at the age of 8 I thought this was a stupid idea. It's a surprise that any of the people who worked on this film have after-careers because it's embarrassing and should never have been done. I could ramble even more on how this movie sucks, but you should already know by just reading the plot.
