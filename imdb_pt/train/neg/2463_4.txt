I do not know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the strangest movies I've seen in a long time. It is very disturbing at times, but also boring elsewhere. The scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and can attract anyone who is in blood and spitting. I found myself holding my teeth during some of the above-mentioned scenes. The clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and The dentist is therefore quite unsettling. <br /> <br /> The mood of the movie is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. But if you are a fan of strange and strange entertainment and teeth being punctured to dust this is just the movie you were looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and feel drawn to this type of entertainment, give it a try! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little strange for my taste)
