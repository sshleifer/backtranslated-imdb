.... this mini does not improve with age. I saw this and its sequence, when originally transmitted, and like so many others, was surprised. In early 2002, I picked up the novels for WOW and W and R and was even more impressed. I then decided that I had to see both again and invested $ 200 more in the DVD sets. I watched the two minis again in painful detail and realized that I had done things backwards - I should have bought the novels and borrowed the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Can not believe it's miserably bad? Read the novels and see for yourself. Do not think this is dated? Screening for someone who is not old enough to watch it originally and see the reaction you receive (warning reactions from such people range from horrified looks to laughter). <br /> <br /> According to the question and answer section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Damn it !! Production quality, soundtrack, dialogue - a great story was turned into a late-'70s novel by an overly ambitious producer / director who was going over his head. This thing was dated the minute it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great when the original broadcast and for those of us who saw them then pull a nostalgic chord that reminds us of the younger days. IMO - This mini does not nearly fulfill its reputation and severely disappoints.
