Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this movie, and be forced to play a Mexican role or he would have been suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Presumably after the success of Dodge City, Warner attempted a sequel to Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends, such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank McHugh, and the ever-present John Litel, but they committed the great mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest by Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to really make things bad, because she proved something, and this is that she can not sing. The story was not so bad, but with Bogie clearly miscued too, it turned out to be a poor western that was too long, and on a low budget, but in fairness, color would not have helped.
