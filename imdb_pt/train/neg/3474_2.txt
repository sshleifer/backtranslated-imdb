This thing is horrible. The character Ben Affleck is egocentric and cheerfully sadistic - punch-on-nose sadist fratboy. And he's the romantic hero! Your cartoon character does not change from start to finish, but your money finally lets you buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were a socialist, I would say beyond belief, but I am not a socialist. <br /> We capitalists like a little Christmas magic from time to time. This is not magic. I do not know what this is. It's awful. And it's a horrible waste of talent. O'Hara has made me laugh hysterically since the late 1970s. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underused. If Ben were out of the equation, these people might have dreamed of something great.
