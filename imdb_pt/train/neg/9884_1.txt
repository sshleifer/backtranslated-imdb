I'm a fan of Without A Trace's first episode. I really can not express my disappointment in last week's episode. This is a REAL problem that many Afican-American families have dealt with and continue to deal with. The lack of crucial media coverage in the first 48 hours was documented in a recent study. Law enforcement, including local, state and federal, is also complicit. What was the purpose of announcing this subject and then retreating over the ending? Apparently, television can handle almost any subject except RACE. This is shameful. Put it all together or do not explore it next time.
