Absolute Dreck. I arrived at 16 minutes / 27 seconds and gave up. I would have given a negative revision of the number if that were possible (although 'pissible' is a more appropriate word ...). Unlike the hiss you could see and practically feel between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between the idiot Dicky Crenna and what is here is simply non-existent. The ankle bracelet becomes a sturdy and unattractive bracelet? Is there no lighting at the fingertips? And I thought it would be SICK when they have a mortified look (and rightly so, believe me) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes practically belching his way through the explanation of his "Little Man" to Mr. Garloupis. No offense to the unseen, but it seems that a legion of blind people rushed to the scene of the houses Dietrichson and Neff. The same goes for those horrible plaid pants Phyllis wears. And crikey, how much $ $ does Neff do, that he lives overlooking a huge marina? This all happens again in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can go through more, you have a constitution much stronger than me, or you are a masochist. But please, get an Alka-Seltzer first, or you'll develop a "little man" that can never disappear. Proceed with caution, obviously.
