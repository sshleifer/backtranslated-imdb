Meet Peter Houseman, professor of rock genetics at Virgina University. When he is not swinging on the court, he is blowing minds and dropping panties in his lectures in the classroom. Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells, allowing humans to become immortal. I'd also like to be immortal if I looked like Christian Bale and get the sweet feminine love that only the VU can offer. A variety of ugly old college professors do not care about the popular Houseman and cut funding for their project because of the lack of results. This makes Peter use himself as a guinea pig for his serum. To my surprise, there are side effects and he, get this, metamorphosis! into something that is embedded in our genetic DNA that has been repressed for "millions of years." He also falls for Dr. Mike's passion for Sally after a full day of meeting her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He's a furious little boy. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a terrible movie, it just is not well produced. During all the time I watched this, I could not miss the fact that this was filmed in 1989. The look and feel of the film is the quality of the late 70's at the latest. It does not help to be packaged together with the 1970 movies, since Metamorphosis is one of Entertainment's 50 Entertainment Classics. There is basically no difference in film quality. The final five minutes are pure and bad, actually, at least for me, save the film from a lower rating. Pay attention to computer terminology such as "chromosomal anomaly". No wonder Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can not spell! This is worthy of a sight, followed by a trip to your local tavern.
