With such a title, it is above and beyond my understanding of how this film simply did not appeal to me. Granted, there are a few decently contemptuous moments and a little gore, but the way the film was filmed and the whole plot just seemed like a dumb and lazy attempt at profuse "shock" tactics ... The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded on the side of the road. He and his brother are imprisoned until his brother breaks out and meets his girlfriend in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they spoil and he then shows a collection of hijacked guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her former boyfriend, who raped her, a "clinging" neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he will kill them all. She ends up killing him and then turning her focus to the men (or pigs) she tortures and kills herself ... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with eating and destroying genitalia - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a cable masturbation of a graphic broom followed by a painful rape ... Certainly, "I spit on your corpse, IP! In your grave" was intended as an unofficial sequence of "I Spit on Your Grave" based mostly on the title, and a reference that the main character gives - suggesting that his mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider this a wildly blasphemous statement! This movie is a boring and amateurish mess that fights for shocks but failed miserably ...
