William Lustig's sequel to "Maniac" conclusively proves that without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and Spinell's compelling performance, "Maniac" would never have become the great success he has made. "Vigilante" is misdirected, with a simplistic script that spells it out for you and is predictable at every turn, as well as mediocre performances from all the actors. Judging from the deja vu sensation this movie gave me, Lustig watched "Death Wish" several times before doing it! (* 1/2)
