Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit his hypocritical biblical citation archaeologist William Finley and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays De Sade in flashbacks, complaining in his cell. Genie is cheated by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who walks naked on horseback and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoke, which leads to a wild hallucination with topless harem dancers, a woman simulating sex oral on a snake, an orgy and his father nailing in the background! Meanwhile, black members of hooded cults decapitate, tear eyeballs and cut throats. When Genie uses drugs in her tea, she imagines Sade hanging on a cross, a woman painted gold in a floss and herself bloody in a bed covered with snakes. It's all because she is the reincarnation of Sade's lost love. <br /> <br /> This production normally lacking in Harry Alan Towers is redundant, decadent and quite meaningless, but the sets, costumes, cinematography and location are excellent and less there is always something going on. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
