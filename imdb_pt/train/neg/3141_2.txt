I just had the proof that confirmed my suspicions. A group of children, ages 14 to 22, put the "Titanic" DVD into a fantastic type of mega-screen entertainment. Only two of them had seen this before. But they had all seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the entire movie. Soon after the epic began, they began to get restless, some of them stopped asking the others - "call us when the iceberg comes". More than an hour and a half in the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, they were still there. They began to scream: iceberg, iceberg. A tumult followed, everyone returned to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat with their mouths open, emitting Ohs and distant exits. So, just like I thought when the movie first entered the scene. What is it? An hour and a half waiting for the bloody thing to sink, but the rest of the rest. Dr. Zivagho, for example, had a similar race time, but think about what happens in that movie within the same time frame. In "Titanic," Leo teaches Kate to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the supposedly crème de la crème in the ship's first-class dining room. Look at the historical details if you can find them. The plot is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings on a ship that is about to sink. The real sink here is of movie standards. All efforts are focused on special effects and opening weekends. The film became the highest grossing film ever, so what do I know?
