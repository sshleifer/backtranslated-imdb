A handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments. I do not want to argue with their opinion, but I totally disagree. When I watched this movie, I was slightly impressed. But after comparing him with other films, particularly with the late master Bruce Lee, I quickly changed my mind. In fact, if it was not for the title of the movie, I would never have bought it. Game of Death 2 does not relate to the original Game of Death, (except he shares a character, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see how Game of Death 2 was compared to Enter the Dragon. The plots have striking similarities: both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. The two sites are similar, in which both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of black belts. There is an element of prostitution in both films (women receive two-quarters of the guests in both films). Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis's squire have a missing hand. His is an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one in Game of Death 2. Han has a pet cat in Enter the Dragon, the director used his imagination and granted Lewis with a pet monkey! The list goes on. <br /> <br /> In relation to other aspects of the film, such as script and acting, I felt it was very bad. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed that they could act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can not deny that the choreography is impressive. Although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them, they are, however, skillfully executed. However, as the plot is insufficient, I could not relate to the characters because the fight sequences were more expositions than having a meaning for the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion I would say that this movie is commendable to any martial arts fan, but for those who like a solid action movie with a good story and strong characters, I seriously would not recommend this movie . My views on this film may seem very biased and one-sided, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in martial arts cinema, particularly after his masterpiece Enter the Dragon, this film failed to meet those standards. If anything they imitated a truly brilliant martial arts film, hoping to achieve the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> In reference to my rating, granting this film a very hard 1 out of 10, the film is barley and should be grateful to have the fight sequences he made.
