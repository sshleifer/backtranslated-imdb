I'm not sure who's writing those brilliant reviews for this movie, but believe me, it's STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horror movies and horror movies and this is LAME, it's only about 80min in length and I think that's all I could do. The plot is terrible, the acting is even worse. And there is no development whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau's films are better than that. JIGSAW RUN. I expected to hate acting, which can be forgiven directly in video films if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> That had no scares, very little Gore, <br /> <br /> and a truly unattractive cast. <br /> <br /> I watched this with three other friends <br /> <br /> I hope you're still talking to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to throw the disk out the window. I can not believe anyone could have given this buff a good review.
