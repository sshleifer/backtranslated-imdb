I've seen this on cable recently and kind of like it. I have been reading the reviews here and it seems like everyone likes the second half more than in the first half. Personally, I liked the first story (shame it was not extended). The second story, I thought, was clich√©. And that "California Dreaming," if I hear this one more time ... The Chungking Express is fine, but it's not something the mainstream audience will see, like "Crouching Tiger."
