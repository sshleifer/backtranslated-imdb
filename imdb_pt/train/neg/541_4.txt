I found this movie quite strange. From the beginning I found it extremely difficult to like this movie, and now, after thinking a little about it, I can well point out the reason. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him in small pieces (I think Zentropa is one of the best films of all time) is quite mischievous here, and although I can not imagine the life of me would be better, I'm sure someone could have taken their place quite easily and made this movie work. Everything else is good except for the stab wounds in the faint comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as the British major. Just suffer from one thing .. Jean-Marc.
