I rented this movie yesterday mainly because of the good-looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket. After putting it on my DVD player, I reexamined the jacket cover and, despite having removed the plastic viewer cover, I still could not read any of the detailed information about the film. This movie is titled Evil on the Jacket and had to locate it by going to Faith Films website to find out any link to it here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> The filming and special effects made on the film looked very good ... THEN a line reading actor spoke. Oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like a bubbly-looking high school athlete, whose voice was barely changed, and no attempt was made to go beyond reading the script. At first I thought I had a bad audio disc, so I had to assume it was a foreign film, since I could not read the jacket ... Dialogue in English nicknamed. If they had chosen the right person to dub the dialogue, this movie COULD have been decent. I gave it a chance about 20 minutes before ejecting it when I discovered that the bad line reader was not going to be dead, but remain as the constant main accessory. Yes, it's so bad! The art of the coat cover and the art made in the film are great, so gave a star but at least 1,999,999 stars for rotten dialogue. I would not recommend this!
