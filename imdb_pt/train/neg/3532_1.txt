It's as if you take the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, take off all your style and class and mix them up with a lot of pretentious new wave "I'm intellectual, so my film must be hard to understand" , kneaded in some extra styles for a good measure, cut the end, there you have Revolver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I thought about it a little after watching, and yes it did kind of make sense, however, that does not stop it being junk. <br /> <br /> Waste of money. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> Up there, like the worst movie I've ever seen, with not even a novelty value on bad film to rescue him a little.
