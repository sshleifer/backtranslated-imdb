This movie was not only bad - it was terrible. After I watched, I really felt the need to take a shower to get the dirt out of me. There's running 'gag' with an elderly couple making out, not funny, but it's disgusting. The monster makeup was cool, but that's all. Errors of continuity will only make you angry - at least I was. The issue is very poor. <br /> <br /> Almost everything you could do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends are in 'bad movies', this is exceptional in their ineptitude, I could not even laugh at it. You have been warned.
