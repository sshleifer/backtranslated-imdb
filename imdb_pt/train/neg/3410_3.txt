Yes, this movie has kids going to the space camp and gets well enough as you have kids meeting and learning the ropes. So they introduce Jinx, a robot that could not exist in 1986, since they have nothing with this kind of artificial intelligence now. Kid becomes friends with the robot and the robot and reciprocates the boy's gentleness by shooting him and a group of other children in this field into outer space with a very limited supply of oxygen and radios that have no signal to reach space. This camp is also not a lot of fun since these kids are put into real training and the instructors stay with them for failed missions or not doing the right things. Take the time, they're there for fun, not to become astronauts yet, just give them the experience of space flight not as a military camp. However, you get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly precocious role. So in the end, a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, you could also have the kids fighting aliens at the top of everything that was happening in the movie, as this would have done. the film a little more pleasant, at least for me. Probably for some others as well, who else would want to see the face of Kate Capshaw shattered by a strange alien creature.
