One of the worst romantic comedies (not the worst movies) I've ever seen. Boy (who works like a psychic phone!) Must pretend to be gay to move into the apartment with the woman of his dreams. The hilarity does not follow. Boredom, gay light-bashing and horrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his low quality dialogue, you will like this movie. Be smart. Avoid this. if you come, destroy the copy.
