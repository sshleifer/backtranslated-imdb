I took part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently, but I could not watch it until the end. Simply horrible! I can not even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula from the first film, which was bad enough. There was a lot of confusion, but the direction and editing were so bad and hectic, it was like watching deleted scenes or scenes. Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not enough to make me warm up. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst sequel I've ever seen, and that's saying something. Eita, because of the ten-line rule of IMDb, I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this sequel made for TV. Disney, hang your head with shame.
