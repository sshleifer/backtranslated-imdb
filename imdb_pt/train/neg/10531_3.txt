This is kind of a genre thing, which means you like the 50s musicals or not. If you do, you'll love it. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the 1940s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers, and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple and so on, but the songs of the 1950s , the slower numbers of dance and the soapy melodramas of the decade discourage me. <br /> <br /> This movie is a case-in-point. The first song was good, but the next three did nothing for me. Until then, the story had not much appeal either. The presence of Deborah Kerr is another less. I do not think I've seen a movie she starred in that I liked, including this one, where the English teacher she plays turns up half the movie threatening to leave Siam. (Me that she had!) <br /> <br /> However, divorcing me from liking and disliking, there is no denying that this production of Rogers and Hammerstein has much appeal to many people, particularly those who liked "The Sound Of Music" a decade later. . There are similarities in R & H music. So, if you liked Julie Andrews's movie, you should also like that. <br /> <br /> This is a lavish production with, yes, a "L." capital. This is the kind of great production musicals you've rarely seen since that generation. You also get dubbed singers, unlike today where the actress is not able to actually sing, so Marnie Nixon comes to rescue Kerr, as she did with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady." "Yul Brynner is the" Mongkut King "and is the stereotyped traditionalist, the kind that filmmakers always portray in a negative way. He is not" progressive, "as the leftists say, but the Education (Kerr, as Anna Leonowens) will put it straight. Today's secular progressives always put teachers above those who try to cure cancer! However, Yul is good in this role and even employs some comedy together with his character more bardo than with bite. <br /> <br /> Justified, he is the great star of this film. <br /> <br /> Even in "The Magnificent Seven", Yul was the only cowboy that hypnotized the public. In summary, it's a great movie for the day and millions of people liked it. I'll leave it that way.
