When you have a bodyless skull, an empty mansion, a schizophrenic wife, an intriguing corpse and a mad gardener, lay a minister and his wife - what do you have? <br /> <br /> AIP's response to insomnia. "The Screaming Skull" earns points out of audacity, offering free coffins to anyone who dies in fear of watching the movie. Bet fairly safe, when you are packed into a stupor by people who think they are in a production of "Suspense for Dummies". <br /> <br /> But Peggy Webber was cute, anyway. She had some good acting moments here and there (especially when trying to communicate with the gardener) and no one else fills a sweater like her. But that frightened face she does - scary in itself. Whoa. <br /> <br /> As a whole, though, there is little suspense here and everything is cabled like a punch thrown by a treat. You can not be scared of this movie, it's impossible. You have your moments, but not enough of them. <br /> <br /> BUT, thanks to a certain Mike Nelson and his two robot friends, there are several moments of pure joy, especially in the copy that they took ("The movie jumped, and it was really scary!"). <br /> <br /> A star of "The Screaming Skull", eight and a half to the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Talk about a "screaming" hole ....
