... for the lieutenant to have chosen this. First, the movie was not horrible, it was just Hollywood. At worst, I need this to happen or we do not have a movie scenario: if Willis's mission was to save the doctor, but she was convinced that her "people" could get out of the missionary, he would have put her in that first helicopter and would maroon those refugees to the border without it. He would not have compromised his package for the refugees. It is not how it works. But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we must have drama. That's why we make movies, because the reality is not so complicated. However, I thought Willis and the good doctor had viable chemistry. That said, there are also some well-done battle scenes in the film. Not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" is worth the DVD rental fee. Check it out on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
