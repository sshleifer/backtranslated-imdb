I was very surprised at how bad this movie was. Nice cinematography and beautiful scenery can only take the film so far. I was hoping for a reprise of Hero, but that's much, much worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is why kung fu movies have a bad reputation in the first place. No believable character (even within the cartoon world of kung fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), almost without plot, and ridiculous twists. <br /> <br /> This movie is so annoying and frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a game of making believe with a child. Every time you think your silly battle makes some sense, they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ("Ah ha, you just think you got me with your super powers and 10,000 lightning weapons, but I ate my vitamins with plutonium ) and teflon, so their lightning weapons do not work and I'm invulnerable to their super powers .... tap tap in the infinite trade backs PLUS one. ") Children can continue with this madness because they really do not care if someone You're listening because they're having fun. However, for the viewer, especially the adult viewer, this long movie is worse than a bad gas attack. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu filmmakers, (a) if you have a knife on your back it hurts unless you are in the PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b ) If you fall repeatedly on your back, you have a knife, it will hurt more and cause more damage, unless it is a false prop, (c) when you are stabbed in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient China where there is not a Kaiser Permanente on the corner, (d) kung fu fights do not last for hours while 3 feet of snow fall, and (e) sometimes it's worth explaining your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> In any case, go watch the Hero again, because at least within your own world is understandable.
