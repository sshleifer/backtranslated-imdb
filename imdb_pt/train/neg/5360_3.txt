"Nothing" was the most inappropriate continuation of "Les Noces Rouges" which in retrospect now appears as the last good film of the Chabrol Golden Age (1967-1973) "Nothing" is Chabrol's first real attempt in a film totally political. his previous work "Les Noces Rouges" also had political elements, but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual view of society in the French provinces. "Nothing" includes terrorists, ambassadors, hostage-taking, lots of blood, not exactly that of Chabrol. A heterogeneous cast gives the film the coup de grace: only Duchaussoy, who had played with the director, and Maurice Garrel live up to scratch. Vivian Romance, one of Duvivier's actresses ("La Belle Equipe" "Panique"), is lost as a madame (Gabrielle). The Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are horrible. <br /> <br /> With "Nothing" this is a second period of sterile inspiration for Chabrol. It would be "Violette Nozi√®res" before he was again at the top of his game.
