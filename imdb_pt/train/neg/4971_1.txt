I work in a Blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come with just a few copies, these are the types of movies that the science fiction channel shows. The kind of movie no one wants, and just what idiots rent, when they bring it back I ask "was that good?", They say "no, we hung up after 15 minutes!" Films with terrible computer-generated monsters, super-taxes, and the like, very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This is the same kind of movie that Grendel is, and absolute waste of time, if you want a reasonably (and only reasonably A good movie based on Beowulf, then try Beowulf & Grendel, starring by Gerard Butler, who is also starring in the hopefully 300, as King Leonidas of Sparta. In addition, this year we have another Beowulf movie, starring Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, as well as Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But do not let that happen as we all did with Eragon, or we're all for another big disappointment. <br /> <br /> And regarding rent, here's my general rule: if there are only one or two copies, do not rent because it's a lot of junk (this is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is foreign or a documentary.)
