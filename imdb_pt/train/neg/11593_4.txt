I consider this movie one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so annoying that I could not remember anything 20 minutes after the movie was over, I even got tired of writing a review. <br /> <br /> Ok, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the guy. clown. # 5 tried to get back to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is fine, basically. They tried to film a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares. Because of this Nightmare 5: The Dream Child is not funny or frightening. What we really have is a boring movie with the usual bad actors (perhaps with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddy killing Lisa's friends using Lisa's fetus dreams) has a good basis, but that's not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the story gets very confusing (maybe because it does not exist) and you can not stop thinking about what the filmmakers were after. The script must have had more holes than the Swiss cheese and therefore the film was very tacky in itself (let me say I do not like cheese, even if I am from Switzerland). Not even the special effects were as good as, for example, in part 4. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about renting / buying this movie, if it is not quite, it's a big mess. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get used to it, # 6 is also a mess ...)
