Why was this movie made? Even bearing in mind the generous tax breaks that Australian film investors have received, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film to receive the green light. For God's sake, the actors in the film are Australian celebrities (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the original Hey Hey Its Saturday drummer, and the Countdown voice actor. very watchable, as long as you give the brain's attention that it deserves: none.The script is bad (even for a confessed horror) and the acting quality and movie is worse.It often seems like a home movie, but even a movie Home cinema has "realism." Anyone interested in Australian cinema, please, for God's sake, pretend that this film was never made.
