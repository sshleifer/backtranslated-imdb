This was shot back with the 1992 version of Conan Doyle's famous novel, "The Lost World." And it shows. <br /> <br /> The film gets promising enough, with a ruthless organization that wants to explore the lost world and Challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go down. Everyone is stranded on the plateau and we get a faint and tedious repetition of the first film. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (which are rarely seen) are laughable. Are we expected to take that cute toy that should be an anquilylosaur seriously? And Tyrannosaurus seems rooted in place. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and get the silent 1925 version of the Lost World. Unbelievably in this era of CGI and other advanced effects, the 1920s version is the best and will remain so until one finally decides to make a decent makeover.
