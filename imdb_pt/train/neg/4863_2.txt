Why, why are not successful movies simply not the point of sale? Everyone in the movies, young and old, were there to see talking animals make jokes, and while they were doing it, we were all happy ... And then, as in Lost In Space, came the two murderous blows - plot and feeling. Who really cared about what happened to the tiger or whether Eddie Murphy was with his daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
