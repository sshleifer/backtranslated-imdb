I do not much like remakes, or steal the modern jargon of "recounts," but this movie really pissed me off. The original Prom Night, although not in my humble esteem a masterpiece, I still realized what it was ... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror movie. Suspense is crucial to maintaining public interest. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle movie was not! The scares were cheap and terribly foreshadowing. (A good example of scare that has already been made for excessive cliches now is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon after, but an unexpected apparition from the movie villain.) This film could not then, how could I expect it to fulfill any another of the horror movie conventions? There must be a nice hero or heroine. This movie does not have one. The person I most identified with was the chief detective. His calm behavior, but level approach to a killer's escape was what more movies of that genre should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from a magician wielding a psychopath, turn around and run in the opposite direction. Do not run, while looking back every three seconds, controlling the progress of the killer, only to stumble on each branch and inanimate object in your If you friend disappears, you will not search for them alone. And if you suspect a crime, tell someone, do not investigate. These cliches are tired and overly exaggerated. In the horror genre in general, and in this particular movie.
