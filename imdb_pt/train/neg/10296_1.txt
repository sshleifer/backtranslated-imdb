It was probably just my DVD - but I would not recommend anyone trying to see this picture on a DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to increase the volume of my TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80% of the dialogue. Some of the conversations still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, maybe you have a chance, though small. <br /> <br /> People's voices have been muffled by almost every ambient sound, including unwrapping a package, footsteps and even smoking a cigarette. With the volume increased to the level where the voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police when the scene switches to a noisy environment such as a nightclub. . And that you will get hurt by dipping for the remote control lower it. <br /> <br /> There is art and art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in times of war, would meet the international criteria to be classified as an atrocity. After about half an hour, I gave up, having seen nothing more redeemed in the picture, either.
