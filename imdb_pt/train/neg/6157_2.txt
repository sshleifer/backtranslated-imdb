Yeah, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where I surfed the canals and bumped into this stinking movie. For some of the cast's names, I would expect a much better film. I'm almost ashamed to see Oscar winner Murray Abraham being reduced to such a horrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students talked about fencing as if they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster. I mean, I've been surrounded, it's a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I watched the whole movie was because the remote control fell under the couch and I was too lazy to get it back.
