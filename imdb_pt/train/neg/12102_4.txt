This movie is really only the interpretation of Bill Maher's religion. There are several funny moments, and some interesting points, but do not go in there, waiting for an impartial discussion of religion. This is what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary - Everything is arranged ahead of time and in the editing to provide the director's opinion, rather than allowing you to make your own decision. EDITING - It's very choppy, inter-spliced ​​with clips from pop culture and media to reinforce the point. The respondent barely has a chance to finish a sentence before being interrupted by the edit. The only people who have a fair chance to say what they think are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say. Once someone departs from the gospel according to Maher, they are edited. <br /> <br /> INTERVIEWS - They are meant to represent the absolute majority of extremist religions. From the evangelical TV to the definitive Jewish stereotype, to a chapel TRUCK STOP (Seriously: A TRUCK WALK). He chose the worst grileiros, the heaviest extremists and those who have no budget to say no to choose. And when he gets a good person to interview, he edits the hell out of them. <br /> <br /> ESTEREOTYPING - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Especially affected are the Muslims. During the Muslim segment, he barely gives anyone the opportunity to speak before interrupting them, either himself, or by editing in chunks with suicide bombers. ALL Muslims are portrayed as armed extremists during the editing, and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly. <br /> <br /> PURPOSE - The message at the end is INCREDIBLY heavy and, although it is interesting, idea, is not presented fairly to the countless people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher is explained as clips of destruction play in the foreground. This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and will destroy the world. He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the flaws of the movie, it has some good points, and the humor, though very unfair, is really funny. But know that entering is a very one-sided view, Bill Maher's view of religion. He is not discovering anything. He is saying what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - Some good times, but with the documentary style extremely irresponsible.
