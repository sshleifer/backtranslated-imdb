This movie is great, remember - but only the way it tells a really bad story. Stella is so rude and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and stingy. Neither of you learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy ways and dressed, but can not understand that she just needs to tone everything up? I think not. Stella is a good woman and a very good mother. Giving up herself so that her daughter can be associated with a lot of fanatic snobs is disgusting. Much of what we see may have been normal for the time - people having a beer or two, enjoying a piano, dancing - but this seems to be a kind of moral inferiority. "I can not have our son living like this!" Spare me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the unrenowned working class can not hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes. And that's just a load of bullshit.
