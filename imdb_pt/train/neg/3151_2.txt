"It has to be you" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This photo is about Charlie Hudson, a former cop who turned Author. When Charlie's fiance leaves town, he gets all the wedding planning. He spends a week in a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn, a teacher who happens to be getting married too. The two quickly become friends and depart to plan their separate weddings together. It's when the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie rips all the romantic comedies of all time and just wait for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really mediocre performances, which makes this movie even more thrilling.
