CLASS OF '61 <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, West Point Academy students are divided beyond the beginning of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> Gregory Hoblit's OK historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men are blinded by conflict - although the production seems a little formal, despite the authentic details of the period and the cast. talented newcomers (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), represented by Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who takes up arms in defense of slavery, putting him in direct conflict with his old friends from the north. The film's emphasis on such a misguided character - though sympathetic - is particularly courageous, but the drama is flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is more efficient than inspired.
