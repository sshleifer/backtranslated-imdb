This film is exaggerated, predictable, pretentious and hollow at its core. The configurations are faithful to the era, but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure. The persistence of the artifacts interrupts the action and goes mad almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be somnambulating like Bruce Willis did in Hart's War. Tom, you can not give depth to a character by simply leaving his face blank! The content does not guarantee the histrionic performance of Paul Newman. This is a failure wrapped in an atomic bomb wrapper.
