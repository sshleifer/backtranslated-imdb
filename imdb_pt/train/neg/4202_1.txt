... I'm missing something here ??? "Unexpected plot developments"? "plot twisting with subversive joy"? are these spectators watching the same vehicle Arquette that I just submitted to (in a now obvious sadomasochism subroutine) I just entered this site simply to make sure no one else rents this stink. ... this film was an embarrassment for every person involved ... Quick question: Sir Stevie read the script before giving positive signal to Kate C.? if so, then it must be the same Spielberg who made the green light "howard the duck" ... do not get me that, "it was a hit" - I'm guessing Mssr. Reddin is not very satisfied ... the cover of the DVD promises "amazing songs" and a "distorted story ..." History !! It sucks like that that makes old Bobby McKee and his band of Structuralists seem like geniuses ... Sundance ?? Berlin? I have a homemade video of my farting cat evoking more interest than Arquette's negatively dimensional portrait of distressed loss ... and, I talk about deux ex machina to Mr. Stanley T.; Thank God, just the moment he thought he had Dave calling the cops! and thank shiva that the cops had just caught the real killer ... what !!! Even the credits, I was still hoping it was some sort of shackle against Arquette and his "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, you did not escape unharmed: what the hell was that kitchen scene with "athlete's foot in my groin "gag ??? Are you worse at this or "just cause"? I do not know ... hey movie lovers: why do not you make a blockbuster night and rent it along with "jersey girl" and "white chicks" and then commit sepukka (or is seppuka) ... and take E. Dunsky with you ....
