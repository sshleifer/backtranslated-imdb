What can I say about Seven Pounds ... well I watched on a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and as that flight was long and annoying the movie definitely did not help. Will Smith's character, Ben Thomas, is almost completely unpleasant, even with his redemption at the end. The two-hour running time of the movie wastes most of the screen time with random junk that just chains the plot as slowly as possible. In defense of the films, the character of Rosario Dawson adds a little life to the film, although not much. I do not understand how anyone could really cry during this movie, when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Will Smith also kills himself with a jellyfish at the end, proving that killing himself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.
