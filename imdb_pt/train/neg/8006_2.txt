What this film does well is to combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that elicits more public emotion than a typical horror movie. Unfortunately, with disjointed storytelling, frustrating scenarios and mixed scenes, this movie has caused me frustration and is hardly "the greatest monster movie ever". <br /> <br /> Let's start with the good things: comedy, acting and special effects. From the beginning, this film starts fast and cheeky. The opening scene - the origin of the monster - is exaggerated and quick, paying homage to the classic "environmental" disasters that gave rise to so many other monsters. The pace is fast, which was a welcome break from the long and often absurd opening scene of other monster movies and lets the movie into the action. With the 10-minute course, you get the "why", "where" and "how" of the beast and are ready for action. In this film the movie delivers. <br /> <br /> After another short and well filmed sequence, the characters are introduced: the lazy son and his precocious little girl, the kind grandfather and the talented sister (aunt) and, of course, the monster. Characters are introduced into each other's context and their conflicts are instantly apparent, allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster suddenly appears to wreak havoc on the river area where they live and work. <br /> <br /> The monster looks great: alien and familiar - kind of like a dog and a fish out of a squid. The creature's effects are unparalleled and, although it sounds strange, it's believable and, at no point in the movie, can you "see the strings." Even the monster's movement was terribly familiar, like a rottweiler growing and excited on the linoleum, the monster barrels in the crowd, slipping on surfaces, crushing and eating those on its way. When the path of the monster crosses with the family and the tragedy happens, it is really a painful moment, and you may feel the need for revenge, but from there the appeal of the movie begins to unfold. <br /> <br /> After the onset of dynamite the film quickly loses focus and continuity. Plot lines are introduced, then abandoned, characters change positions for no apparent reason, and comedy is entwined in dramatic scenes, confusing intent, while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random. <br /> <br /> As for comedy, let me say: I am willing to accept that much of the humor is probably cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, so maybe things get lost in translation. However, as an Asian student studying in college and as someone who has lived in Japan for 5 years (still here), I would like to think that I have a better understanding of Asian humor than the average white. That being said, there were many parts of the movie that I understood should be funny, but for me they were not. <br /> <br /> *********** SPOILER ************* For example: after the initial attack in which the young daughter is lost, the family there is the funeral; everyone is in mourning. A new character is introduced - a brother - and the tension is heightened even more when it becomes obvious that the two brothers are in conflict with one another. Both begin to cry for their loss and end up competing with each other for who is suffering the most. This competition is, in essence, funny: two brothers who do not like each other so much as to compete at a funeral - this shows the thorny nature of common family love in Asian comedy. It is supposed that this subtle slap-comedy that ridicules the family and ritualized mourning is funny, but it really seemed out of place in the context of a little lost girl. ************** END SPOILER ************** <br /> <br /> Then come the holes in the plot. there are so many points raised in this movie that are never explained, or, worse yet, are explained and distressed only to be proved impotent and meaningless in the end. Finding an obstacle is not an obstacle can be a good thing for a character, but you would expect some comment about this nature. Instead, the public is bombarded by times of anti-climax when the problems simply "are gone" and no one gives an indication that someday it was a problem to start. So, I ask: why bring this in the first place? <br /> <br /> This prevailed throughout the film because the problems gave rise to new problems, and suddenly the world of the film is filled with opposing forces that have never solved each other. Of course, introducing new and bigger problems is a time-tested story, but if the introduction of a new bow leads to the forced shortening of another, you would at least expect the new bow to be fully explained. Not in this movie. Instead, it was as if you had several stories, each explaining only 20% of the way, and in the end, the parties never converge to complete the whole. <br /> <br /> Once again, I am willing to accept this. much of it can be "cultural." Maybe it's in the Korean tradition of telling stories to put the comedy into a tragedy. It may be normal for the stories to spread like a child who has color off the lines on every page but never finishes one. It may not be a problem to have a problem to develop the plot, but then randomly remove this problem without any apparent solution or catharsis. Or maybe these are all the marks of sloppy work and the rampant bad narrative in a movie that seems to have a far better reputation than it deserves.
