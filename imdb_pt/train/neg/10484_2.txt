Being a fan of Elvis, I can not understand how this project could be done. It is by far the worst film related to Elvis of all time, totally bland, silly and many mistakes about the king. Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast try to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as an impersonator), the cameo Tom Hanks is a surprise, but the guy who plays the young Elvis sucks. In general, the movie is not fun and it becomes more annoying minute after minute. If you want to see a small, ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny movie related to Elvis, I really recommend you "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
