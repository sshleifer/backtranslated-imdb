Okay, at first, this movie looked pretty good, even though it was moving pretty fast and even though they had a budget of $ 60,000, that was fine, but if you found your dead sister in a pond and found out who could have killed her he around and pull a gun at him with just a bullet and waste it and end up running away from it all retarded and kill himself? Also, after you found your dead sister on the lake and found a clue and found out who the killer was, why would not you give that clue to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie, when she acts like her sister, who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy, she should meet him somewhere and recorded saying that she was dead and what happened to her "proves." I do not know I was not happy with the ending. This movie could be so much better if it lasted longer and the performance was better and if the ending was not so bad! Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do, you will be writing a review here too and you will not be happy.
