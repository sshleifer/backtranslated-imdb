This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I would like to be able to travel back in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the "movie" "War Games - The Dead Code" was filmed 2) Watch the original WAR GAMES with my current knowledge of computer science and the eyes of a pre-adolescent of 1983. 3) Invaded the pentagon computer in the 80s with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered. 4) Reprogram WHOPPER to NUKE the LOCATION of the DEAD CODE minutes before your first day of shooting 5) Go back to the present, have a beer and have Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones "flash" my blank memory of the entire event , especially my original preview of "The Dead Code" 6) Have another beer and watch GAMES OF WAR 7) Be happy until the next bad remake of a 80 GOOD movie. <br /> <br /> 8) I forgot Jar Jar is dead. I'm not sure if I would have to travel to the future for this. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
