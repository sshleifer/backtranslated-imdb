Much of "Over Your Dead Body" is so painfully dull that I was actually writhing in my place for the shame of the actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves she can not take a movie in this terrible romantic. comedy and, moreover, that she really does not even have a comic timing. She is annoyed and annoying as a ghost returns to earth to prevent a psychic cook from dating her widowed fiance. The groom is played by Paul Rudd, drippy and without charm, while the psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing the film any anemic energy it has. I felt a lot for Bell as she seems to have some comic skills and was working in an effort to make the stuff work. Unfortunately, she is against the unsurpassable task of making any film that features Jason Biggs tolerable, and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast as Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic." <br /> <br /> "Over Her Dead Body" really disappointed me, because of her laziness and utter lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that can not be funded, because large amounts of money are being channeled into such soft crap. Seriously, does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How stupid do they really think movie audiences are? <br /> <br /> Grade: F
