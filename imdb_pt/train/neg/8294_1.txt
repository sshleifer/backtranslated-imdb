There may be something poetic about seeing the dentists suffer. They suffer, in this sad movie truly horrible, but they make the public suffer also with the pain of non-dental variety. If you've always wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids, noisy children, sick kids, many long, long meaningful looks, a blank wife and a worried husband: it's all here for you. Boring, for a long time, stands out as one of those examples that scream: why? Is there saving grace? Yes there is. There is a short Nabucco scene with some good songs. Save your money or, if it's on TV or cable, save your time. You can always read a book or make an omelet.
