I spent almost two hours watching a movie that, with all the good actors, would be worth watching. I could not believe when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened ..... I was angry because I could have used that time doing something else ... I tried to find out everything but it really had not idea. Thanks to everyone who discovered and explained ... right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything !! Who was the woman in the movie with dark hair that we saw sometimes driving away? How did the first lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie, Kate said she would find out the truth. Does this mean that we will be subject to Game 2?
