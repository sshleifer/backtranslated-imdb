The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen all the versions of Jane Eyre already made). The development of Jane's childhood and character was exceptional. So it was as if someone said "Uh oh, this is running way too much," and cut the rest of the story to pieces. The main scenes, when included, are concealed, combined and placed out of order in such a way that they completely change the plot. There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone unfamiliar with the story to follow. The great disappointment was that the beginning opened up so much hope, and then the end destroyed it.
