This is another of the many B movies less marked as film noir, hoping to generate some interest in something that is devoid of it. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. The performance of the three leads is made of wood. I think John Dall was expected to go to places in the movie business but then someone realized that he had little talent and therefore ended up doing a TV job. Lee J Cobb, who is usually fantastic, can not beat the poor script and the bad direction. Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale, but she does not even come close to convincing viewers. The film has two of the strangest cars I've ever seen, the one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. DVD transfer is typical of Alpha.
