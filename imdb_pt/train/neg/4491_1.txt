1/10 and that's only because I'm not going lower with my ratings. <br /> <br /> skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie in the "Trilogy", do not buy or rent. Trust me, you will not be missing out on anything. the Architect does not bring new information: _ (spoiler) _ there have been more NEO's before him, he's like nr.6 or something. you already imagined something like that from the first movie: Agent Smith telling us that the first Matrix created did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died and Neo's "love" brought her back, where have I seen it before? Ah, well in the first movie the roles were reversed! even if the action scenes nothing new with only more opponents. the action scene (the 20+ ships) in the great battle that we did not see (perhaps in Revolutions?), betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe the guy holding the knife who wanted to stab Neo?!) who pushed the EGM Button for logo . <br /> <br /> All in all a shameless stratagem to make money (especially out of the guys who went to see him more than once), which evidently worked like a charm.
