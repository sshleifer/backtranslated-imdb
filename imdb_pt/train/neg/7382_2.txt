Well, let me say that I've always been a fan of Steven Seagal and his films are usually great, but that does not compare to the rest. This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like everything. The biggest reason I do not like it is because it's so flawed and it does not make much sense to me. The acting is really bad even Steven Seagal does not do good acting, The rest of the actors I can see because they only make direct to video films. It does not follow a direct storyline, everything happens at the same time, so it does not make much sense. There is no action on it and to make a good action movie, you usually need action. The special effects are very bad and you can tell they are fake. So all this has to seagals worst movie ever so if you want to see a movie Steven Seagal do not rent this just pretend it does not exist. So, just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ** out of ********** *** out of *****
