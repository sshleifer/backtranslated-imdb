I borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme, but the thought of role playing really intrigued me. I was pleasantly surprised that it was filmed in San Francisco since I live near SF. And of course it was cool to see photos of the Castro district (although the castro for me actually caters more to gay men than women). But other than that I can not really recommend this movie. The characters are not really developed for me to care about and when they finally started to get to role playing I was already bored crazy. And the role I saw in the scenes was a bit embarrassing to watch. Performance leaves something to be desired. Needless to say, I did not finish the movie. I would skip this one.
