What a fucking movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as fun as a dead slug. No talent, what ever actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script?! Was there a script for this silly movie or did the director accidentally press the record button on his camera and decided to make the movie as they went? Is this to be a children's movie or a comedy or what? My younger brother friends are in 6th grade and he and his classmates have just made an amateur movie for the school project that outperformed this nerdy movie. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! There is no excuse for this movie!
