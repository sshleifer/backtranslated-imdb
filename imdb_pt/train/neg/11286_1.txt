Where do you start with such a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Did you mention the cast of unpleasant heroes? The exaggerated acting? The terrible script? <br /> <br /> No. You just said that anyone who pays money to see a movie as poor as that needs their head looking. I know I do. I respect the poor guys who saw him with little or no prior word from magazines like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy is not available for quality movie magazines). However, cinemas really should start thinking of giving refunds if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after he opened with two other friends. The only other person at the movies was a guy alone. <br /> <br /> And that was cheap night. <br /> <br /> Either the ad campaign failed miserably or the news spread to most people. of the country than this is horrible. Since the days of The Avengers (1998), I've felt so little changed since watching a movie. If a partner shows up with this video in a few months, make sure he or she pays your electricity bill while watching. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves a prize for not breaking - or leaving the set; Keith Allen maintains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on set for his acting, Rhys Ifans does not make his career after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is kind of a busty secretary. Think of yourself, considering it used to be in The Word, any spectator's expectations about their acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not bad considering the obviously limited budget, but this script is atrocious. . If you want to hear a lot of nasty characters say "Fak!" for a couple of hours, then this should be right up your street. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bargepoles required. <br /> <br />
