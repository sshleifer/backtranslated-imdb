Lee hosted the 100 Years of Terror for Ted Newsom and was talking about film werewolves. He said something in the sense that his only contact with lycanthropy was The Howling II, and then joked, "The less you talk about it, the better." In fact, he was right, because this movie may well be the worst in his entire catalog of onscreen performances. The first Howling by Joe Dante was an innovative werewolf movie with its incredible special effects and its sense of style and subject. It was a movie to be taken seriously. Like other good original films, the filmmakers, for some strange reason, thought that more exaggerated sequences were needed than what worked for the first time (see CHUD and CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles and miles away from the first on all fronts. There is absolutely nothing scary about it. It looks cheap and is pitch black in most of the main scenes. Lee is the only actor in the movie that is worth mentioning (okay, I give Ferdy Mayne too). Lee looks embarrassed when he says futile dialogue and does ridiculous things (check out what ends with him and Stirba). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what this is, which is a bit more insightful than the two leaders who leave America to go to Romania. The story is not worth examining here, and you can bet there is a little story worth mentioning when you need Stephen Parsons and his band Babel to spend much of the film at the beginning and end that terrible noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, she undresses once and then we show that scene again and again and again - one critic said 17 times (I counted ten - but he may have been so bored so far). I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a scratch - the three I gave are 1 for Lee and two for Mrs. Danning's contributions. Disgusting!
