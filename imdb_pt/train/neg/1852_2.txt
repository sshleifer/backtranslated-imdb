Whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke. I mean, this was the dumbest movie I've ever seen! A snowman killer terrorizes a small town? Give me some time. I love it when he leaves driving the police car. More like a comedy than a horror movie. If you want to laugh, rent it. If you really want a horror movie, stay away from it !!
