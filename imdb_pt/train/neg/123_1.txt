Oh brother ... after hearing about this ridiculous movie for many years, all I can think about is the old Peggy Lee song. "Is that all there is?" ... I was just an early teenager when that smoked fish hit the US. I was too young to enter the theater (though I managed to sneak in "Goodbye Columbus"). Then a display at a local movie museum waved - Finally I could see this movie except that now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it !! <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case unleashed by its US release. Millions of people rushed into this stink, thinking they would see a sex movie ... Instead, they had lots of deformed and repulsive Swedish closes, street interviews in bland shopping malls, as a political pretension ... and weak who takes care of simulated sex scenes with pale and flaccid actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, sacred chalice, historical artifact ... whatever that thing is, tear, burn and sink the ashes into a lead box! elite aesthetics still try to find value in their false pseudo-revolutionary political attacks ... But had it not been for the scandal of censorship, it would have been ignored, then forgotten. <br /> Instead, the title "I'm Blank, Blank" has been tirelessly repeated for years as a titling for porn movies (I'm Curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I'm Curious, Black - for blaxploitation movies , etc.) and every ten years the thing rises from the dead, to be seen by a new generation of suckers who want to see that "film of naughty sex" that has evolved the film industry ... <br /> < Yeesh, avoid like the plague ... Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the "dirty" parts, only to end it. <br /> <br />
