First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like your other movies, but this movie is like my resume. The Biggest Crap Bag Ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who gets scared in a Comedy Building called Apollo. On the way home from a show, while riding his bike he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck. Shortly thereafter, he chooses the body of an old, white, selfish millionaire. Then he dresses up as the Outkast music group while trying to play the original scene where he comes out as a Jockey. Second, he returns to the Apollo and tries to be the comedian who tried to be in his previous body and begins to dissect the white population and tries to be black. You understand me? This movie is horrible, it tries very hard to be like the original and in the process comes out looking like a garbage bag. Just accept my advice, do not even watch this movie.
