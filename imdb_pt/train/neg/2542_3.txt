... not that all Disney movies are crap. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" first and loved the movie. When I heard it had 2 strings, I was in a trance. I finally found a copy of it and watched it one night. I do not see how they can make a sequel to a horror movie. The original is a film / documentary about the Fauke Monster, and can scare anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be seen by anyone. I do not remember the plot very well, it's been some time since I watched it and I will not watch it again, but ... It's about these hunters coming into town and they're going to look to kill Bigfoot. Three small children leave the house to stop them. A great monsoon passes. The hunters get hurt, they are saved by the children. Then they all hide in a boat with a large piece of canvas on top and try to wait for the storm. Then, suddenly, Bigfoot comes and does something really sick. I do not want to ruin the end of any of you, but it's not scary. Good....
