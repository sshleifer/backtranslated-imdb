Another cult attacks again. This is not a spoiler because the REAL ending comes after you research the people who brought in this overly long and pseudoscientific infomercial ... The Ramtha School of Enlightenment. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy needs to hide behind a screen of deception similar to OZ, I move away. Thanks Ramtha I watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a "friend" ... having wasted precious resources on this New-Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they "really believe that they can walk on water" enough to take that orientation to their "logical" conclusion ... in other words; walk, drown ... or shut up :-) As a movie ... it deserves a strong "1" in its entertainment value, especially to create the most unpleasant character in film history (the roommate of the photographer ... eeeeeek!). If you need to see this movie, borrow it from one of the people who recommended it.
