I saw this movie at London Premiere, and I have to say - I did not expect much, but I expected something that was at least slightly fun. <br /> <br /> The original "Wild Instinct" was not a big movie and still something of an "obscene classic," but it was fun. I remember countless times flipping channels on TV late Friday or Saturday night, finding the movie and beginning to pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> However, this brain lame, waaay-late sequel has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still beautiful? Well, let's put it this way - for a 47-year-old girl, she's really hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. She also had plastic surgery on her face, and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unpleasant. She does not look as smooth or genuine or innocent as in the original - which is kind of a point of being a bad seducer, and everything. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (a typically secure director - one who does not always do a great job but manages to make worthwhile movies) has officially handed over his first true turkey; a movie so bad that people laughed at certain moments that claimed to be serious. <br /> <br /> I heard that the movie went through several editing sessions, and it's very clear from the beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the end - alas! Talk about stupid and unbelievable. (Still predictable, though.) I've seen "Gigli", I've seen "Son of the Mask" - and although I'm not looking to "tarnish" this movie, I can tell with my own authority (what you do not I have to agree with that, remember you) that I prefer both films about this catastrophic failure. By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie started and people in the theater started to throw things on the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy-like nightclub. "Wild Instinct 2" - basically, it stinks too.
