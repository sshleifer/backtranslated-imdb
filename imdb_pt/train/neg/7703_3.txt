A famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend. Suddenly, she kills him and runs away while an old lady suffers a heart attack. The female killer's name is Sawa. She is still going to school and works for a ruthless criminal, Akai, who is sleeping with her. One day Sawa discovers that he has killed her parents. <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this action thriller is a disappointing Gore fest. "Kite" has style, but it's still crap. The strange plot about a teenager who kills people as a killer tried to be scary and touching at the same time, just making the story fall on the floor. One of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good / evil heroine Sawa is falling along with a bodyguard from a building, but the dramatic structure is not so well orchestrated and the quirky and grotesque animation of director Yasoumi Umetsu from the faces of the character is horrible. Not only that, the strings of intercourse are simply scary. Note: 3/10
