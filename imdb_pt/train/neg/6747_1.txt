Wow ... wordless about the making of this movie, I can not say much. The display box in the local video room should have said it all ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses who got lost on the Scream set and decided to film a movie! <br /> <br /> The acting was apparently not on the budget, but they were able to pay for nudity and good-looking actors! Style over substance almost makes its mark here, except that most of these working class failures forget that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they are reading this script. After only 4 or 5 deaths by the so-called masked killer and a confused plot about a Murder Club that the actress thinks is a real club she can enter (only if she can beat a girl bumping into her) car), you want to stab hands with the nearest pointed object to remember to never get overly excited with a possibly good movie like this. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the people who bought this movie and I can not find someone to take it out of their hands. Another example of what is wrong with the growing number of direct video releases of horror, without any thought, is put in the essentials. Throw it away if you bought it.
