The premise sucked me in, but it became clear about 30 seconds into it being David Lynch or something terribly awful. Interesting watch just to go through the list of fundamentalist outfits. I may be a sucker for a touching spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual about it. The message seems to be that we should all pretend we have an IQ of 80 (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without any kind of self-examination or we will unleash the second. arriving. It's the kind of attitude that drives people to ride jumbo jets in 110-story buildings (I work around the corner from the old WTC site). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
