This kind of film in which a psychopath of one variety or another tries to undermine the reputation (and eventually eliminate completely) of a naive person in order to take charge of his life. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female and Thousand Movies Made for TV are just a few examples of this. But while some, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, could offer at least some extremely paranoid characters, suspense or some twists in the plot, Unlawful Entry touches everything by the book. And were it not for the notoriety of its stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this film would sink to mediocrity faster than a miniseries of Danielle Steele. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessant A naive guy who asks for help from an officer when someone invades his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he silently expels his anger by feeling so helpless in the situation with the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a typically psychotic villain with no limits to his power. At first empathizing with Carr (probably just pretending to), the cop befriends the couple. But soon, the cops want Carr to stay out of the way, destroying the lives of the guys in almost any way they can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who installed the guy's security system his home) in order to take over and presumably get his wife. It seems less purpose-oriented, and more like the police officer just wants to prove his power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, an end. And the story unfolds entirely through the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the "shocking" moment, our main and naive character realizes that he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the villain psychopath) to the end of the turn-around-it-not-really-dead.
