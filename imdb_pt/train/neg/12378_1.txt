Wolf lusty and lustful. The young "Red" is wearing full makeup and shorts and extremely short shorts. It takes about 20 minutes and I realized that it could be the dream of a pedophile to come true. The up-beat music sounds a lot like something I hear in a strip club. I really think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, happy that I was watching this with my daughter, I do not want her to think it's normal for families to see almost child pornography together. Too bad, too sad is sold as a family movie, Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed that he is in it. And what's with advertising as a "spectacular special effects" ??? The effects seem low budget, horrible.
