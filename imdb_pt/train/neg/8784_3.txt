The idea was incredible, the actors were incredible, the story could be very scary, but the writing was bad and there was depth. I really could not get into that movie. I could not feel the characters, there were a lot of cliffhangers, and the movie ends up very strangely. Was it a happy ending? I do not know. Was it a sad ending? Again, I do not know. You leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. The film had a lot to give, but could not. Just because you can edit does not mean you should, right? I really would not recommend this movie because you can not say you left the movie as if it were full. You'll just be confused. Trust me, you'll probably thank me if you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
