Almost all the details of the plot of this film are illogical and implausible. It bears no resemblance to a genuine, dead, and bland human story. It's a parody of Hollywood, with musical trumpets reminiscent of a Denzel Washington movie, staggering photos and outbreaks, racist stereotypes, utterly unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in poses of clothing catalogs. It is made to suit the crowd of zombies whose meaning in life derives from seeing celebrity names. The only good thing in the movie is the final credits and fun songs that accompany it. I feel like an idiot for watching this, save yourself.
