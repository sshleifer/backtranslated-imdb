** Spoilers Possible ** This direct video mess combines an armed heroine, Z-grade effects, Nazis, a mummy and endless filming of lesbians and is still boring; The 45-minute length of the video just looks like Eternity. The only good part is one of blooper outlets, where thugs force an egyptologist to sit on a chair - and a villain's foot is almost crushed under a chair leg. Take this snoozer back to the video store and watch a game of golf, bowling or tennis.
