Have you ever heard the saying that people "telegraph their intentions?" Well, in this movie, the characters' actions do more than wire up future plans - they show up at your house drunk and pat you on the head. This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or differentiated. The character of Embethtztz is not mysterious, only wood, and Kenneth Branagh can not convey the impetuous charm that his character probably wrote. <br /> <br /> The result: obvious plot, one-note performances, unpleasant characters and grotesque "Southern" accents used by British actors.
