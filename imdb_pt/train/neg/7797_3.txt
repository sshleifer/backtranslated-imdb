This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I want to say that some of the criticism I had heard turned out to be unwarranted. <br /> <br /> As for the pure technique of making films, this director is competent. It is limited by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene are quite professional. I have seen many movies in which the "direction" was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and it has some clever photos here and there. In addition, the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. There is so much you can do with a VHS camera, and it does a great job with regard to technical details. As for artistic merit, there is none. The scene where the camera moves so we can see a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds is a kind of epitome of the art style of the whole movie. That's pure trash ... Total trash. <br /> <br /> Blood is decent for a movie in this budget range. It's obviously false, but there's a lot of it, and it's very strange. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version with intentionally extravagant dubbing. That was a good idea (and it's the only thing that allowed me to get through the movie) ... Unfortunately, it's an exaggeration, especially in the end. <br /> <br /> It really is a terrible movie, but I have to recommend it for the value of the camp. It is very difficult to find a movie worse than that and it puts you in a unique category.
