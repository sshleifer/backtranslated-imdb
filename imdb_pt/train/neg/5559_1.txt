This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Did the Avengers have this dubious honor? but not more. The performance on "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. Do not know if it wants to be an S & M movie or a really bad thriller. Just watch under extreme intoxication or if you're in bed and need a distraction dressed in leather. This script must be reworked into a porn, would not require much effort and would have a longer shelf life. Pornography, even bad pornography, would not do the damage to Dolf Lundgren's career in the way this movie has.
