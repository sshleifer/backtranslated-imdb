Lightweight SPOILERS contained here. I'm spoiling this movie to keep you from having to watch it. <br /> <br /> Jet Li's films fall into one of two categories: period films and Shaolin films set in modern Hong Kong, which revolves around triad-like organizations or triads. Each genre has its best and worst movies. "Twin Warriors" is Jet Li's best Shaolin-era film, while "The Evil Cult" is his worst. "Fist of Legend", while in the recent past, is the best movie "Jet Li" of the modern era. 'Black Mask' is undoubtedly the worst. <br /> Jet Li plays a self-exiled mercenary who has received an injection that gives him superhuman ability but shortens his life expectancy. In his "new life" in exile, he plays a pacifist librarian. When his former mercenary squad goes into fury, Jet Li becomes a determined vigilante to stop them. He uses a very silly corrugated cardboard mask to conceal his police (and public) identity as a librarian, as well as hide his true identity for his former comrades in arms. <br /> <br /> version I saw was dubbed, and terribly in it. Why does Jet Li capture and hold his classmate hostage if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why does not the chief of police care when he discovers the true identity of the Black Mask? The plot is simply BAD. Bad because of the tacky superhero, bad in the sense that the characters are never properly developed, bad in their character interactions, all crowned by a semi-explained story I quickly lost interest in. <br /> <br /> The action and martial arts sequences are far above the top. Plenty of blood, explosions and superhuman martial arts fights in the Matrix style are present in the film. Unfortunately this is the best and only selling point of the films. If you want to see Jet Li playing a vigilante superhero in an Impossible Mission style movie, 'Black Mask', it will be released. For the rest of us Jet Li fans is a real disappointment. This is one of those movies in which Jet Li never gets to be Jet Li: he does not have a chance to charm us with his charisma, nor the chance to impress us with his impressive but realistic martial arts ability. <br /> <br /> Normally, a Chinese imitation of Ozzy Osbourne would be enough to swallow me into a movie, unfortunately 'Black Mask' proved to be an exception to that rule. In fact, the antagonist of this film, by the way he dresses, his long straight hair and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged Ozzy Osbourne. However, the villain is not on the screen long enough to make the trick worth it. I'm guessing that the similarity with Ozzy was intentional; besides the villain's visual, he also ran a satanic-looking hiding place. Much more could have been done with the trick of Ozzy Osbourne's villain! If only the writer, director, or ANYONE had bothered to develop and develop the character of the movie villain! <br /> <br /> `` Black Mask '' was Jet Li's first video released in the US. after Lethal Weapon 4, and I'm glad I've stayed away from it so far. It may well have ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li in his worst case, rent 'Black Mask' and 'The Evil Cult' and make it a dual feature or horror, both intentional and unintentional. Otherwise, join movements that use Jet Li's talents and have plots that are well thought out and plausible. 3/9 stars.
