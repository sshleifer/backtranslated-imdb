I do not remember seeing another murder / mystery movie as bad as that. This film about a medical examiner who investigates the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident has the complete receipt of a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of suspense, bad humor and no drama. I remembered seeing this movie on PAX, a notable TV station for offering low-budget, TV-made movies like this. TV movies, of course, do not have the edge factor or the suspense like big screen movies. But this movie certainly hit all sour tastes. The producers of this film missed the opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" a great TV movie; the title offers some suspense. <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, do not watch this movie. This movie alone can kill your appetite on TV. <br /> <br /> Grade F
