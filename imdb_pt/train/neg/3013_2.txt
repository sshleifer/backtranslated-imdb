Beginning with its long filming of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers at a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes tries to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and on traditional societies. His monotonous narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is totally unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. That there is no connection between the current Asian thrust of industrialization and wealth and the earlier experiences of hunger and terror are never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is an effort to present the photographs of Edward Burtynsky. industrial waste as somehow "beautiful". Much of the film is a slideshow of these images. They are well-produced, museum-sized, and have apparently appeared in various exhibits. For me, however, they just demonstrate that almost any photo can look beautiful if well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photographs and the spoken message of the film remains unclear. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize. Manufactured landscapes, however, offer only a strange and bitter despair. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. It may have some value as a demonstration of what is wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
