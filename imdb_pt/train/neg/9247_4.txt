"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essanay films. Although these film groups are more watchable than those of 1914, this seems a little below average. The gag with the locker double locker and the end of the difficult fate that has Charlie waking up from a dream, in which he is stroking the hair of the front lady, only to caress the head of a mop that he wore like an almost pillow , both are classic moments of Chaplin. Both are ironically the beginning and the end. The middle is filled with fights with the caretaker of rival coworkers and bursting a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this film and Charlie uses it for a comic expert effect, whether it is the intention of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter ego doing things he'd like to do, but not with his own hands. Interesting stuff, but there is better.
