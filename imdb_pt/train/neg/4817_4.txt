When you're doing a witchcraft thriller, I believe you should do everything you can to help the public suspend their disbelief for the movie to work. Some photos ("Rosemary's Baby", for example) did this; others (such as "Necromancy") do not have it and potentially frightening material appears cheesy and goofy. This film has some atmospheric moments, but about half of the dialogue is difficult to understand (sometimes it is poorly recorded, sometimes it is incomprehensible) and Orson Welles, who has the best billing, has a role that is so BENEATH that you have to assume that he was desperate for work. Or maybe he was just having fun ..... (* 1/2)
