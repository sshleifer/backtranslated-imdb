I can watch a good bloody movie now and then. I saw some very sick things. However, this is one of the few movies that I found grotesque in a way that was simply repulsive and revolting. I like gore movies when they are fun. I like it when they are very creative behind them. The blood in this movie is not creative. Is sick. This is disgusting. It's completely unpleasant. Because of this, this movie is certainly not fun. The movie is a horror movie, but it is not afraid. So, pretty much the only reason anyone watches this movie is by blood, but that's the ugliest and ugliest aspect of the whole movie, and that's a lot. The acting is terrible, the plot does not make sense, and the music is very boring and very electronic. Everything got me out of the movie. Almost the whole film is a long and depressing ordeal. There's a guy who has a strange accident on a bus and wakes up in a hospital to find that his skin is dissolving and melting. I think after that he goes out and eats human flesh to slow down the melting process. There is a strange subplot involving a couple of old men being chased by a dog, a dismembered head floating in a stream and an end involving a man being electrocuted. There were times when I tried very hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the entire movie that I found really amusing was the scene at the beginning when a nurse walks down a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly, nasty and nasty horror movies, this one is for you.
