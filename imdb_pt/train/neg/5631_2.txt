The picture on the DVD is so dark I thought the screen had died. I think I missed seeing half of the movie. Still, it was poorly crafted and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title "The Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but I did not get involved enough to take care of the first frames. I rented the film especially for Willem Dafoe and was sad to have wasted his talent. I do not believe Giada Colagrande has studied film enough to develop a great movie. She is attractive and can become an actor, but she has taken on many tasks in this film. Although they are married in real life, they do not have chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem believable. I do not understand why the other characters were introduced to the plot.
