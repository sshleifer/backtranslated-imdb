I, like many people, watched this movie when it first came out in '97. It was a below-average movie, at best, not the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fanatics like do. Firstly, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter which way you look at him. People like him because of his appearance. His acting "skills" consist essentially of saying many cheesy phrases and trying to act sexy. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: the girl falls in love with a guy, the ship is in sinks, many bad love scenes after that. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize that this is not ingenious in any way. Nor is it original. In addition, the director felt the need to drag him for more than 3 hours. I could compress it in a block of 1 hour without losing the plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most overrated film to date. Because you have so much attention and money is beyond me.
