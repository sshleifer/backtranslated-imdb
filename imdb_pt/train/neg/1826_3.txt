I saw this movie last night and even after a few beers, the only giggle this movie left me was when I realized I was actually watching. in a word, it is bland. Not funny. I totally believe the tidbit trivia about black jack apologizing for making this crap. I can not believe that Barry Levinson not only played this script when he read the first page. Also, I can not believe I watched more than ten minutes of it. <br /> <br /> I gave him 3 out of 10 * because I love watching Christopher Walken make terrible movies for pay. In addition, the "corky" horse, because it exists only as a character in this film, is really ridiculous.
