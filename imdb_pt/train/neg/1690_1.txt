This movie was horrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if it were paid for. The so-called horror scenes were unpredictably predictable and most touched. There was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Do not go see, do not rent, do not read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed to mess up her good name with this movie. Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible and horrible movie. Horrible movie, you do not have to see it.
