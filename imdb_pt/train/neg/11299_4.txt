The Mummy Tomb begins with a review of events in The Mummy's Hand and then advances the story for several years and crosses the ocean to the United States where the current high priest and mummy Kharis try to take revenge and avenge those who raped the tomb in the past. <br /> <br /> Although I loved "The Mummy" with Boris Karloff as the Imhotep mummy, and I quite enjoyed "The Mummy's Hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (who is the direct prequel to this movie), I was not so taken with "The Tomb of the Mummy". <br /> <br /> It's done in a similar style to the previous movie and has a somewhat similar storyline, albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is fine as Kharis, but does not stand out. And I think that's my main criticism of this movie - that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing really remarkable either, so the viewer gets a rather tasteless mummy tale.
