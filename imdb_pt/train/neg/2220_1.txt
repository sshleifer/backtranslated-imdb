What the hell is on their minds? This movie sucks! Every minute I was getting more and more bored. I struggled to watch the end because I hope at least something finally happens! But instead, I was struck by how tedious the end was dealt with ... What is this story about this damn "boggart"? How does he not die? He's a bloody human for the love of God! A mere kid who killed his silly sister 15 years ago. So what ? Did your stay in a psychiatric hospital make him immortal? This movie is fascinatingly stupid ... It's a must for foolishness. I'm going to resell it now to a silly guy who will understand this silly movie.
