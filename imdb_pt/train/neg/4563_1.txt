<br /> <br /> However, it's the funniest and most idiotic movie of Disney, and it will ensure laughter from silly stories and plots from start to finish. Finishing. <br /> <br /> It's a bunch of short stories that seem more fanfictions. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * The first is about Beast and Belle being petty about a pathetic argument. So three new losing characters decide to fix things by forging a pardon letter to give Belle. In the midst of this little episode, Belle has wall eyes, which made my brothers and I laugh so much. Then she and the Beast fight over the letter ... and then learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> So the next is about Lumiere being the biggest drug in the world when it comes to romance. This coming from the man who could attract anything feminine. And they make FiFi a psychotic villain who tries to kill Belle, and ends up getting free of the scotch until the end. What a message to send the children! <br /> <br /> So, the next one is about Mrs. Potts being distressed. And the next, after all this, is about Beast becoming overly possessive of a bird, to the point of looking plain silly. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly that it kills. There are at least 100 errors you can see clearly ... and the coloring is horrible. <br /> <br /> Belle is a sap that licks whenever something goes wrong. Besides, she's mean and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the secondary characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time.I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated in that.) <br /> < But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She's ruined by it. I can not even describe it. Just buy and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give 1/10 to the sap, but I give a 10/10 to the comedy.
