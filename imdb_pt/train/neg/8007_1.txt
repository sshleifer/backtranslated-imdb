I really did not expect this kind of movie outside of America. How one can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turning it into a "thriller" is just sick. Auteuil (whom I had admired before) walking around like a kind of Rambo who saved children was ignorant and insulting to all the sexually exploited children around the world. <br /> <br /> What is doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground floor hit movie "Happiness" came out of the year before this movie. Menges and his companions should be ashamed of themselves. It is admirable to read some of the comments of the most intelligent spectators out there. They were able to see the poor and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think that this is a great movie exhibit a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch "Happiness" to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely? be kidnapped and sold as a sex slave or molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm ... I wonder. If they are going to make a film about international child slavery of any kind they owe it all to make it realistic and emotionally engaging instead of this crap to push the button. 1/10
