I've never seen anything as horrible as this movie for some time. The film was boring, long and terrible plot. Special effects suck, it's like watching a movie in 1999. It's a total loss of an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was very poor. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he was not that bad. Actually not bad at all. But in this movie, his acting was not convincing enough, it was really bad and there was not any chemistry among the rest of the team either. Besides, his eyes seem empty as if he is not feeling it. That surprised me, really, because he was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, do not even bother watching this movie. It is a great and great waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, get something else to do besides watch this movie. Trust me, you'll be sorry!
