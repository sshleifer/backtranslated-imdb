This does not reach the depths of Creepshow 3, but it comes close. He also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in various roles throughout the anthology, which is a distraction to say the least. <br /> <br /> It's also quite annoying to boot up The Twilight Zone (with the bookstore being comparable to Serling's Night Gallery). Unfortunately, the producers and writers forgot that Serling would create sympathy for his characters before ending them. Neither character is particularly nice or interesting until the last segment. <br /> <br /> Plot: Adam West is ... well, himself. He does not make the 60s path of Bruce Wayne / Batman, but rarely does. He simply plays the non-particularly-enigmatic "Jay" (there is a sinister name chilling to compare to the likes of Dr. Terror, Eramus, and The Cryptkeeper), and makes some slightly awkward / scary statements. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: "A Stop in Willoughby" by Rod Serling? So you saw that. The nut's wife's red herring is presented for no purpose, but even the friend of the main character identifies him as a coward. As well directed as can be expected, but basically incoherent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Dinner: Remaining from Serling's time-travel stories, mixed with Steve Allen's "A Meeting of Minds." Most of the actors are not so bad (except for Josh Astin as Cassius, who can walk, talk and even breath awkwardly), and the idea is slightly interesting. But like Abernathy, she's not going anywhere. The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, deflects a little (who would not?) And for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear desert. Life Replay: It's not a bad little piece, and it manages to precede both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magic properties of remotes. The main character is slightly sympathetic. Nothing substantially groundbreaking here, but that's okay. <br /> <br /> Spirit Fighter: You see the turnaround coming a mile away, but as the main character, it has a little heart and is a decent story of defeat and redemption. /> Finale: So ... why do people end up in cold rooms with silver clothes? Do not know. And it does not make sense. So ... all the protagonists went into the bookstore and got stuck? Half the happy ending ends with the boxer (thank you, guys!), And the guy from the first segment died. So how did he get stuck? He visited the bookstore before he died, got stuck and ... did not he? What? There is? I suppose this does not make sense because it's supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> General: Basically not unlike the two most recent Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time. But there is nothing really spectacular here.
