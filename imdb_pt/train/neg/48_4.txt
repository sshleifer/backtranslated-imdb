There are some cool scenes in this movie, it captures some of the scenery with such a beautiful light, in fact, cinematography is probably the best feature. <br /> <br /> But it's basically done more for TV movies, and although it has many plot twists, which keeps it pretty interesting, there are no subtitles and developments of main plots are revealed in Spanish, so the speakers non-Spaniards will be somewhat lost. I had as a Christmas gift, as it is a feature of the family working through the movies of an actor that we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was amazing in "A Time to Kill," and the " The Newton Boys "so I expressed that I wanted to see more of your work. <br /> <br /> However, while saying in the DVD box is a Matthew Mconaughey movie and uses it as a marketing move, it has a few lines and is on screen for not too many minutes at the end of the movie, it's basically an extra and it does not light up exactly the screen while it's turned on, so the harder fans are, but it's not worth from that point of view. <br /> <br /> Film star Patrick McGaw is great and very easy, and his character is so cool and kind and thoughtful, a real saint of a guy, he would be well written in a ROM with. <br /> <br /> So, for the true brilliance of Mcconaughey's acting, I recommend, "A Time to Kill," "The Newton Boys" "Frailty," "How to Lose a Man in 10 Days," "Edtv "and" Amistad "and also avoid" Greater Than Life "and" Angels in the Field "unless you feel like a children's movie or have children around as none of these are indicative of your talent but are a lot of fun children's films, again MM is really nothing more than a supporting artist with only a few if there are lines. <br /> <br /> As for Scorpion Springit is not a bad movie, but neither is it screen theft.
