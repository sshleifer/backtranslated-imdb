Cradle of Fear <br /> <br /> This is not a movie in which intricate and delicate narrative nuances occupy our attention. This is not a movie where special effects should leave us open-mouthed, expressing that whoa feeling. What is, however, is a slice of lo-fi horror that leaves little to the imagination, created in the eyes of director Alex Chandon, as "a setback to the horrors of the 70s and 80s." <br /> <br /> This is a very visceral experience for 2 hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood, reams of dismembered body parts and bowels, tied by a bowel wire for revenge. <br /> <br /> The provider of such horrible violence is Dani Filth, lead singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth, performing a role he was meant to play. <br /> <br /> As others have said, there is nothing new about wanting to carry out occult revenge. In this particular context, a condemned predator and sexual murderer, Kemper, the father of our devilish avenging angel, compels his son to demand retribution from those who are somehow bound to condemn him to purgatory within an asylum. <br /> <br /> What this gives Chandon, who should be congratulated for also writing and editing this piece, is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free. He seems to delight in the idea of ​​splashing blood in the holes on the screen, and in every nook and cranny that can be reached. We are also accustomed to close-ups of skulls being crushed, demonic rapes and other varied images to engage those who enjoy being close and personal to their horror. And for some of those who closely follow that kind of movie, there's a weird sequel that might make you think, "I just saw what I thought I did," because of course Pretty Woman is not. This reminds me of some of the bloody feasts created from the Italian horror 20 to 30 years ago, and a host of other works in which disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were seen. <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> The set's history is particularly intriguing, where the idea of ​​obsession can lead to death in the quest for Internet violence through the "Sick Room" where the user is in control of how a life can be erased. Other thanks must also come out for a soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass, often overlooked in filmmaking as a viable form of visual support. Using the city of London as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie substitutes also adds support to the film's sense of command. OK, classic, it may not be, but blood, intestines, intestines, occultism and demons in a non-perverse and little problematic way.
