May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May adrift, unsure and questioning his life and future. Finding herself drawn to her daughter's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences. Filmed beautifully, but despite all the realism and acclaim, The Mother offers a collection of unpleasant and even unpleasant things. repellent character, and asks the viewer to get involved with them. Reid shines as May, and it is his skill and commitment as a wonderfully discreet actor who rescues the film from a thoroughly depressing mud, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create absolutely obnoxious characters, which becomes increasingly difficult take care of what happens in May. As it is written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are indeed so selfish and cold that they begin to wonder what exactly Kureishi was trying to say. As instructed, they do not want or are unable to raise Bobby and Paula above the two dimensions in their gruesome selfishness. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing for Reid's performance, but little else. A tearful shame
