Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to rank judges below 1. What a shame. This ghastly movie is so bad that I actually changed the damn thing well before the end. The script had some brilliant moments, but the direction, editing, acting, audio quality and especially the time in the delivery of the line was as disgusting as making the judges totally unbearable. <br /> <br /> Judges was advertised as being like a modern day western style comic, but in reality it was nothing like that. Which is more like dog poop at the bottom of the shoe. You can try to pretend that everything is fine, but it stinks. <br /> <br /> Why do the broadcasters think that it's okay to carry this type of garbage with constant flaws in audio and worse than high school drama class. Acting is beyond me. We rent movies to see something better than what is on television. But the judges are worse than the most pathetic original on the SciFi Channel. I intend to demand my money back from Hollywood Video.
