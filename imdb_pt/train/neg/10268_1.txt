Without a doubt this is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted money on! The plot is, sorry, did I say there was a plot? The scariest moment was when ... I can not think of one! The best special effect that hid me under the bed covers was ... I can not think of one for that either. You knew who the killer was from the beginning. There was nothing scary about the whole movie, in fact, the only two vaguely interesting moments were when you saw your younger sister, Misty, in the shower and when you saw Toppan taking off her blouse. This movie should only be seen to get an idea of ​​how NOT to make a horror movie !!!
