This is going to be the most useless comment I've ever made, but I still have to do this to warn you about the movie atrocity that "Freddy's Dead" is. It's not just the worst chapter in the Nightmare series, but it's up there with the worst horror sequel ever! It was boring, meaningless and almost free from death. The terrible 3-D and over-the-top CORNY killings are enough to get this "movie" to the ground. However, it does not stop there, just add a bad acting, a terrible script and a lot of curious participations and you will have that pile of guano! No wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, made two post-mortem appearances. I would if I went out like that. This is a strictly fan-only movie, do not look at our shame.
