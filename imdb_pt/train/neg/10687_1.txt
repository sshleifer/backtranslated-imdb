End Game started well, the less said about the end, the better. it seemed that things were just happening to keep the plot, for example, the reporter who at first is a very curious and intelligent person, halfway does something really stupid and totally out of character, we are not given a reason for this. Besides, the next scene would not make sense without her. The entire story could have been told in about 30 minutes, would have made a political TV drama on average. The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very much assisted however and James Woods does an admirable job considering. <br /> <br /> The end The game was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen ...... and that's saying something, I saw Gigli.
