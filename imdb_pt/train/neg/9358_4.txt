From the moment the movie starts, there is already a discrepancy. As this film takes place on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East, and is also an international film, one would expect suitable accents portrayed. This is not done like most of the sound of the American cast. Also, I think the performance is rehearsed at best, the plot a bit difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very accurate in clothes and scenery. If you want to see a movie to get an idea of ​​what it was like in the past (though the lack of accent) then this movie is worth renting. If you are looking for a movie as epic as the Kingdom of Heaven, look elsewhere.
