Where to start ... Ah, yes, Message to the bad guys: When you first meet the person you have accompanied (to kill) who witnessed a crime you committed, do not waste time talking to her so that she has one more opportunity to escape. Message to the victim: When the bad guys are talking to each other and arguing, take the opportunity to "RUN", do not sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear. Message to the director: If someone has a 5 or 10 minute lead in a vehicle or on foot, you can not have the thugs on your heels or bumpers right away! time and movement do not work that way. It would also be good to think that a woman does not have to brutally kill (4) men to enable herself to leave an abusive relationship at home.
