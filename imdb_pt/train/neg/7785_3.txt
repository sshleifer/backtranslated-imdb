I did not know this was a silent movie with narration. I do not care for silent movies - the humor humorous, the flickering lighting and the cinema, etc. I'm sure the attributes assigned to the low grade were assigned to it. It was about Chapter 8 before I found any interest in this story and had popcorn that I could have thrown on the screen. Maybe that pleases the science fiction crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on a Friday night and there were a total of 6 people all over the theater. Isabella Rosselinni narrated this film - the only nice aspect of the film. No one failed to comment how much they liked it, nor did they appreciate the unusual approach of telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
