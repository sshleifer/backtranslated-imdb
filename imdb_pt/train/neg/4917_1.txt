**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely without doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. Totally impossible to take this seriously. It would take a great novel to list all the comedy routines it contained. During the glory days of her show, Carol Burnett and company, who often took off in movies, stuck it in ways hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the music came out and everyone looked around, asking where she was coming from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with chains and almost seemed to like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing funnier than that is the actual movie. <br /> <br /> What a death scene in the end. Jenny really looks like she's dying well ... dying for her makeup artist to come in and give her some color. And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to go to bed with them during the patient's final moments. The final scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the world of movies is an instant classic. He had so much to worry about. He never recovered from it.
