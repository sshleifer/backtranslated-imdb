Interesting movie about a real event that occurred during the Civil War in Vermont. I kept my attention to the end and did not regret seeing it. I've never read anything about this incident, so I was curious to see if the rebels had succeeded. I like historical films from that time. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is with the uniforms of the Confederacy. They look very good !!! The acting was a little hard sometimes. I like the old man eating mashed potatoes because he had no teeth. The wounded soldier playing with a dog was a little strange. Overall, it was a descent movie.
