I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or because he gets his name in the title, but maybe he should not bother. As another commenter mentioned, there is not enough horror or eroticism to attract fans of both genders. The plot is incoherent, the Sade sequences are free and most of the acting is like that. Englund was doing her best with weak material, and Zoe Trilling has a great bottom, but not even enough to carry this film. This is a tape. Grade: F
