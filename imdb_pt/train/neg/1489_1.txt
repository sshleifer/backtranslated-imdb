It got bad, it got worse, and by the time the girl attacked the old lady in the end I literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed and choke the C ** T to death with it. Avoiding this movie, a bit of good cinematography and a few naked pictures would be almost acceptable if I were 14 and had not seen Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If anyone feels the need to watch this movie, I strongly recommend that you pass the time more appropriately, as an example, I would say that trying to stick a Lego house on your rump without lubricant would be a good start. I heard that this movie was not the original version, I would very much like to see the original, as it seems that this cut version is devoid of all the plot, and apparently most of the nudity, can someone please tell me how I can achieve in contact with Christian Viel he owes me an hour of my life back!
