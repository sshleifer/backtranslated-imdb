Basically, what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious classic kitsch horror 'Death Line' of the 1970s, which ironically was like this cobbler, also partially filmed in the abandoned underground station of Aldwych. <br /> <br /> Make good use of the now-disused Jubilee Line platforms in Charing Cross as well as Aldwych, this movie contains basically the same plot - suspected of killing crazy zombies in the tunnels that attack the lost passengers they lost the last train - originality is not strong point. <br /> <br /> In fact, the strengths are sadly missing. Blood goes from the poor to the unnecessarily bloody, while the sub-Gollum nut is never really fully explained, as it seems little more than an underdeveloped plot device. Franke Polente has little to do with a thin script than running over a lot of tunnels and screaming from time to time, in fact she was like almost everyone in this movie, out of action by a small dog and a bunch of domesticated mice. <br /> <br /> If chilling films set in the London subway are your bag, or you just want to play 'spot the tube location' they catch this on DVD when it hits a bargain box. If you're looking for classic horror, go and dredge a copy of Death Line (also known as Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a quality, well written and acted film, you will need to change trains. .....
