I chose this because the song was made by Hans Zimmer, a client of Metasonix modular synthesizers (made by someone I loved). Cover art says "2003 version". <br /> <br /> I give you a point for a strong woman, a point for futile dialogue and a last point for the clear blue eyes of Meg Foster, of which there are plenty of Shots. It was fun to see David MacCullum swimming casually (the pool has a plexiglass viewing window!) while his mistress was being chased by a psychopath in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were marginally impressive - that is, wealthy houses in Los Angeles and Mendanassos (sp), where the castle was. I caught myself wondering how they were able to keep cleaning with all the dust around. The wind was not fierce enough to be believable to me. I kept thinking that the animal skins on the furniture should be unpleasant ... etc. and I realized that the movie must be pretty boring if I'm imagining these things when the supposed plan was unfolding. I stumbled over things like why she lit a fire, put out the match, then threw the match into the fire?! Stuff like that. It was at best clumsy. Oh well. Robert Morely had a little fun with his weird character and a good vacation.
