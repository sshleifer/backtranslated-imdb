Honestly, who in the name of God gave this movie a rating of 8.1? I think the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise, this movie sucks! This film is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student film. I'm a movie buff and I've seen terrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeemable here. The story and acting were the worst I've ever seen. The props, including the use of toy weapons with terrible special effects, were as bad as anything else. I'm in favor of bad language in the movies, but F-Bomb has been dropped every three words and I think we can have a winner for the biggest use of F-Bomb in any movie. The film also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not real movies. I would expect this to receive awards for an amateur movie only shown on public access stations across the country, but does not belong to a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free rental movie coupon. This is a valuable time that you will never return. Unfortunately for me, this time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this my warning.
