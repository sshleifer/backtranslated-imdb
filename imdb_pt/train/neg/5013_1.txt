I'm not going to argue with anyone who considers this movie as execrable as the performance of January Jones, but please make sure it's already on the AMC Mad Men TV series, starting later this month. She is excellent, Like the whole cast, I will affectionately assume that she took the role of "Taboo" strictly for the money, and, realizing that a putrid mess would be, did a minimal work to avoid starvation. know if that is the case, but I (now) know for sure that she can act. At first, watching "Taboo," I was convinced that his delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some meaningful revelation about his character or plot. No such luck. It's hard to believe which the director did not suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjaw. Ironically, her winning performance in "Mad Men" comes as a character who, at least in her first appearances, is very repressed, reserved, unsure of herself, and quite colorless, not unlike her paper "Tabu". But as the TV series progressed, it began to thrive on someone questioning the traditional role of white mommy from the early '60s. I can not wait to see where they will play their character in Season Two. <br /> <br /> To summarize, avoid "Tabu" like leprosy, but definitely check out "Mad Men".
