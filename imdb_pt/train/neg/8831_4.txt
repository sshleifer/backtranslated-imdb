Having heard so many people talking about this movie, I thought I'd give it a try. Aside from being incredibly slow, which I do not mind as long as the wait is worth it, but it just is not. As many others have said, there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film does not seem true. The reaction of the four men changes shock, horror in finding the body to complete indifference while they fish. Of course, if they were the kind of man who would continue to fish happily, then they would have just informed the body and said that they only discovered it after fishing ... why on earth they tie their bodies to a tree, they go fishing and then say To everyone that you found the body two days before? It's so hard to watch a movie knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the city's inhabitants, well, do you think at least one of them can show some curiosity about who really killed the woman! The body itself, naked, except for the panties ... what scenario leads to this? If she was raped then why still the panties? If she was raped with the clothes, then why remove them then bar the panties? If she was not raped, then why take all your clothes off your panties ... leaving yourself with evidence to undo? I really can not think of any realistic scenario that would lead to this other than killing someone to steal your clothes so you can fill your jumble sale booth! Oh, well, it's watchable, but just fair and just because, despite the poor script, the acting is strong.
