Revenge is one of my favorite movie themes. Moreso, "the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite movie themes. Having seen Irreversible, by Gaspar Noe (2002), I expected an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weak and unenthusiastic attempt that expresses nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus. * SPOILERS * The final scene, a scene of gratuitous rape / torture between men and men, has emerged as nothing less than a fantasy of female revenge. However, the movie does not even go away. Instead, the rampant scene (which FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both to the degree it was graphic and in which it was ritualized) is crowned with a photo of Dawson's face in an expression of regret or "This does not fix anything "while the rape of his rapist is heard continuing in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not one of shock, but of confusion about what was such a graphic scene. trying to pass to the audience. I mean, did we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice in Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of all this? Do we feel the moment of Lamentably Deplorable of Dawson? In addition to this flaw, the film is actually kind of clumsy with more style than substance. The characters are fine, the dialogue is monotonous, and so on. Normally I try to make movies on their own terms, but Descent does not really seem to know what they were. Thumbs down.
