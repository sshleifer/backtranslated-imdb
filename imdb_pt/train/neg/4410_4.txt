Typical action movie: A good cop gets tangled up in a mess of corrupt cops and Japanese gangsters. <br /> <br /> The right result has decent performances, a few fleeting inducements of laughter, and a few fair action sequences. plus a chance to check out the beautiful Danielle Harris - who takes full advantage of her perpetual typecasting as a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** out of ****.
