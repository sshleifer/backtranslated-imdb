As is often the case, movies about self-loathing characters are not usually a good drama. 'Downloading Nancy' is no exception. It's supposedly based on a true story about a woman being murdered at her own request by someone she knows online. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is Nancy (Maria Bello) who is married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game that his company has successfully marketed to several bars and restaurants. Unlike most humans, Albert has virtually no positive attributes (except for his ability to be successful in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a somber, serious expression on his face. He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to prostitutes. When his wife asks for sex, he punishes her by masturbating in her presence. <br /> <br /> Nancy is also a character note. Not only did she have a loveless 15-year marriage, but she was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up (fortunately there are no flashbacks of that story in the film). Her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and a result, she is forced into therapy. However, she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy is so depressed that she gets in touch with Louis over the internet. He is a kind of sadomasochistic gigolo, who has sex with women for money, while inflicting huge amounts of pain. It is revealed that Louis has two children, but he does not see them anymore (the children's mother does not want anything else with him). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is to first have painful sex with Louis and then kill her. . There is a particularly nasty scene in which Louis has sex with Nancy while cutting her vaginal area with a piece of broken glass. These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis makes a visit to Albert, who ties him and attacks him with a golf club. It seems that Louis has a double plan in seeing Albert: 1) rebuke him for his treatment of Nancy and 2) take advantage of the beating he receives. It takes time before Louis reveals Nancy's fate - first, he forces Albert to take his dog to a relative so that someone cares for him in the future. Nancy's fate, of course, is that Louis finally ended up choking her to death (but she did show some hesitation at first when she made it clear he had some "feelings" for her). We soon learn that Louis has been imprisoned all his life for the murder of Nancy. <br /> <br /> What exactly should we get out of a movie like "Downloading Nancy"? Should we feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is that the main point of the movie? Is sympathy for Nancy really justified? I think not. The writers of the film create a man of straw in Albert's character - someone who is so disconnected from his emotions that he is solely responsible for Nancy's decline. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I think not. They have the repulsive Louis, a man who earns his life inflicting pain, arrives and rebukes Albert for neglecting Nancy. In addition, his expressions of love for Nancy (before killing her) should show their "sensitive side." <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not matter if the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie. the various characters in the film. They are so keen to excite their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence, that Downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in bad taste and soft porn.
