In short: Spike Lee clearly has a lot in mind. He is thinking about colorism racism, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, 'hetero-sexism', drug policy, etc, etc ... <br /> <br /> This level of consciousness is itself is great. I think it's a blessing that more and more people choose to critically examine key aspects of our daily lives; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee is making contentious films does not make him a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> What appears in "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two major failures: First, Lee is simply trying too hard. He seems to be desperately trying to accommodate all the political / social statements he can think of in the 90mins. And as such, the end result seems confusing and irresolute, as he does not allow himself time to develop characters that can fully incorporate the ideas he hopes to present. And so he exhausts the stereotypes and we get hasty testimonies and very loaded dialogues. The end result is very staged and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Second, in attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of social functions, he seems to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social / political issues presented. What appears is a pool of regurgitated nonsense. You feel that he bought an elementary level sociology book and spat out all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are highly problematic features because the art of cinema is sacrificed and the work is turned into a speaker for the voice of the filmmaker's voice. He is unable to distance himself from work and allow him to speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It works neither as a work of art nor as a solid political argument. <br /> <br /> Although I still appreciate Lee raising these important issues, I must say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
