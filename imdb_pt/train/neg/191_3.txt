... did not live in Montana and especially did not live there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "A river runs through" is certainly a well-made film from a filmmaker point of view. Great scenery, Redford acting well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story). <br /> <br /> I felt sorry for the narrator / author, who is as dry and narrow-minded as his father, a preacher. Being led, not directing his own life, he is left to watch his brother, who is also caged in the small-town environment, losing his life. The author never comes close to understanding the motives of his brother, but at least realizes that he is without the least amount of homour / fun. All that is there is fly fishing, where he follows even as an old man the style of his father. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it is predictable from the start. <br /> Definitely NOT a must see (3/10) <br /> <br />
