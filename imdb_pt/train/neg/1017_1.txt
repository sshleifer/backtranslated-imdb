Oh dear God. That was awful. Not bad, so there was. This movie does not make any sense. He runs all over the map and is not clear on what he is saying. The music seemed to be trying to be like Batman. The fact that "Edison" is not a real city, takes away. Ever since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places has become unbearable. Why did not they make a real city? The only writing that was decent was "Timman," in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over and campy. It was really a shame to see John Heard play such a bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie to be a failure. What a pity. I hope someone important will see it, and at least give credit to John Heard where credit is due, and hire him as the bad guy again, that's where he should be. list A.
