I remember watching this movie in '86 when it first came out and what a horrible movie. The acting was atrocious, the plot was so fragile that it should or should have been blown away. I think it put me to sleep on more than one occasion and I was not tired I remember. Please avoid at all costs better yet have all your teeth removed without anesthetic cos it would be more fun. Too bad I can not give you a zero or negative rating. I wish I had not wasted my money getting this from the video store all I can say was that the tape that I was in was still new, pretty much hardly surprising how the movie was so poor. If I remember well I sat and watched it with a girl that I really wanted to leave with the fact that she was sitting next to me was still not enough to keep me awake that's how bad this movie was.
