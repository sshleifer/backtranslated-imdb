This show is simply boring !!! I'm sorry for the actors for having to try to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laughter tries to cover up the sad jokes and the track "Awwww" appears in the most unnecessary moments. Super-dramatic children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also, this show is cliché of the city. If you were looking for the word cliché, it would be "Full House". Every story has a "life lesson" to be learned in the end. A sappy speech makes everything better and still has the ability to make the most naughty child have a sudden perception of GASP goodness too bad this could not be possible in real life. I do not know how anyone can watch this show without speaking badly about the characters' behavior or laughter. I find myself screaming on TV saying, "That's not funny / sad / beautiful." If life really were like this, the world would crumble.
