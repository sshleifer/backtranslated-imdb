102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> It is believed to be cured, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and begins to make a fresh start in life. Things are going well for Cruella, who is busy helping the homeless dogs on the street. When the clock hits Big Ben, things get bad. The hypnotic cure is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she's determined to make that tarnished coat she's always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close reprises his role as Cruella de Vil and once again is the highlight of the film. Each scene with her is worth watching in this boring sequel, which looks more like a replay of the previous movie, rather than a new story. <br /> <br /> She has changed. ???
