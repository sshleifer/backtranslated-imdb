The Quay Brothers are directors who, judging by conventional thinking, should have made short films. I really enjoyed your first feature film, The Benjamenta Institute, but judging by your second work, The Earthquake Shuffler, I'm willing to agree that they have not even come close to equaling your genius in the past. The piano tuner is undoubtedly a wonderful film to watch and often to hear. Unfortunately, it is very painful to sit down with your contorted narrative and its glacial pace. Reading the plot synopsis, it sounds like a good story. But the Brothers fail miserably to bring him to life. One thing they should consider completely avoid in the future: dialogue. My God, it's awful here. A huge bust.
