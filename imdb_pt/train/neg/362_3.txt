Not to be confused with Madonna's "The Next Big Thing", "The Last Big Thing" is a silly and extravagant comedy about a man who wants to start a magazine called "The Next Big Thing." reviews a variety of artists on the rise. This low budget indie makes "Chuck and Buck" look like a masterpiece. Disturbed with lousy performances, bad sets and costumes, etc., "... Thing" deserved some terrible reviews and so far only been nominated for a fringe award. Go through this one.
