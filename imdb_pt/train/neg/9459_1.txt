Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines sum up this small, low-quality movie that only draws idiot kids and their parents to the movies. and it's ... # 1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looking more like Michael Jackson. Some Chineese lady who falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and horrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham leave in 2005, I'll be so happy! (no) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan are probably going to play two funky guys trying to find the lost Green Eggs and Ham. They're going to try to chase Sam-I-Am and that guy who's getting away with it. (I hope they do not spoil the classic book.) Do not waste time and money watching this.
