I gave it a four purely out of its historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it suddenly appeared on Showtime in the early nineties. <br /> <br /> Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act like a duo. Spade Cooley has some numbers. I think it had something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not sure why the plot was so minimal that nothing really stands in my memory. I vaguely remember being a Western musical comedy. Even the Stooge seem to be going through the motions. Overall, nothing to really recommend here. <br /> <br /> If you are not a Stooge fan, do not bother. If you're a Stooge fan, stick with the shorts.
