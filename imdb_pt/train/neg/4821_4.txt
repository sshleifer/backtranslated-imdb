Fictional film (it counts as based on a story, although it has a "documented" credit) on a group of scientists going into the jungles of Canada to try to find a Bigfoot (they want to capture one and then attach a trace). device). Its lots of mumbo jumbo scientific mixed in what is actually a dull movie of a group of people wandering in the wilderness. There are some attempts to create tension and scares, but to be perfectly honest, there is nothing worth seeing outside some fantastic scenes of the fields. This is a perfect definition of an exploration film, it promises you a lot, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it offers very little. Recommended for insomnia only
