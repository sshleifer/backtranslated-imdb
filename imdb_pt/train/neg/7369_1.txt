I had the feeling that after "Submerged", this would not be better ... I was right. He must be looking for champagne money, and not caring about the end product ... his voice is repeatedly dubbed by a stranger who does not sound like him; the edition is - well - just a note above amateur. It's nothing more than a level B or C movie with enough money to hire a couple of talented cameramen and an "OK" sound designer. <br /> <br /> As the previous poster said, the problems seem to appear in post-production (... voice dubbing, etc.) Too bad, because the plot is really right for a SG movie. <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG movie unless he sends me an e-mail asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Sorry - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> --jimbo
