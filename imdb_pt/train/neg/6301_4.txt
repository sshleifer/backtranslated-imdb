Despite the excellent work of supporting actors and an intelligent screenplay by Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of character / central actor charm. One character describes Richard E Grant's character as "a little whining mole" and, unfortunately, that sums it up perfectly. There is nothing about him or his performance to make it believable that his girlfriend and the high class editor / friend spend so much time and emotional effort with him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive, and completely annoying. The part called by an actor that can make you love him even when he's being silly - an Ewan McGregor, for example. <br /> <br /> All the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted, thanks to this annoying and completely appreciable performance. All I wanted to do was shake him up and tell him to get over himself.
