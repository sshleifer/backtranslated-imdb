I chose to see the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it had been selected for the prestigious Competition section of the Cannes film festival. I was surprised that Cannes could be so off target in judging the quality. <br /> <br /> The film, some critics, noted that there is not much of a shootout - but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your child or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There is some evidence of Corleone's contrasting sons in Copolla's "Godfather" that seem to resurface here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film, but the quality of the two is as different as chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> The film is only recommended for violence addicts.There is not a big movie theater here. At best, it can be considered better than the usual Run Run Shaw production for production values.
