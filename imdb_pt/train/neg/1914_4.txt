not bad, but not good. it's just fun. <br /> <br /> Like a comedy that's supposed to be, it's terrible. many laughs are not all, since all the jokes in the movie were made a million times before. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, since all the actors in the movie are usually great, but none of them actually do much. and the end is a drug.
