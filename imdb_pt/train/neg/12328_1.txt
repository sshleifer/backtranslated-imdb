It's obviously illegal. Pedophiles pray for things like that. How did they manage to make such a movie? This movie is all summed up in one word, SICK. Where do people go out doing and watching this kind of movie? Since I was watching the movie, I really did not think they would allow this kid, say, 12, if he really slept with this woman. Sorry if this is a spoiler for you, but I would have rater did not see this. Where did the sanity of these people go? Maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles? Our society today is full of all kinds of sexual predators who pray about children, but filmmakers make these kinds of movies that do nothing but trigger such behavior. I noticed that in a previous comment someone asked if there was a version in which it showed nudity. This is a child here, and is someone asking something like that? What's wrong with this picture?
