OK, I've been a big fan of Black for a long time and got kicked out after watching this movie. Let's name the problems ... First, this movie has a lot of the same team as the first two. PREQUEL was also called the original Black Stallion. Why can not they have the correct Shetan's mother's name or her color? In The Black Stallion Returns, we learned that Sagr was the CHESTNUT mother of Black and in this movie she is a gray mare Jenny name?!?!?!?!? WTF And this is set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 ... I may be wrong, but the first was set up in 1940 as well as when the ship is shipwrecked. The timeline does not seem right to me. Also, as a joke, there is a friesian at the beginning of the movie who is supposed to be Shetan's father ... after notice, it seems to be a castration. Ben Ishaak is the only character who even stayed to make this movie seem related to the previous two in some way. It may be a cute family movie for some, but it's my biggest movie disappointment of the year.
