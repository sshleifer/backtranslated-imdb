"Laugh, Clown Laugh", released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito created an outcast (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) into adulthood and named his Simonetta. Tito created the girl in the life of the circus and became a talented dancer. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not let go of the fact that Tito, now well into middle age, is horny for young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he raised her as a daughter. This kind of "ick" factor pervades the entire film. Tito competes for Simonetta's affection with a handsome young 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls in love with the young man, but feels guilty for abandoning Tito (for loyalty, not for romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it incredible that no one in the movie tells Tito what an idiot he is (until he reveals it at the end). The film is noteworthy just because of Loretta Young, who would have a great career. While I love the brilliance of Chaney as an actor, this whole movie seems out of my mind and simply creepy.
