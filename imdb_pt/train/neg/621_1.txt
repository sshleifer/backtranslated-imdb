Holy @ #% and this movie was still hot and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to watch this pile of purulent waste, but found it easier to slice my wrists and push back a Lysol floor-cleaning shooter than to withstand more than half the crap that was on my screen. I rate this well below anything I've ever seen in the movies or on TV, and that's saying something. I once witnessed a cow crap in a field. I watched the steaming pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... could have moved or something. Well, that was better spent than watching that gut. The acting was non-existent, the plot was elsewhere than in this movie. I think I saw a cut seen at the beginning where the plot managed to escape and was walking in the background in the back of an old pickup truck heading to Portland in the hope of becoming a holder of Steven King. Please tell me the principal is taking medication that he needs so badly. It is very clear that he needs heavy medication and I would like to receive the money needed for his lobotomy reversal. Bah ... I can not give this comment the total punch it needs because nothing so painful can be done justice in the word typed alone. Let me just say that if you are looking for a movie to spend some time and you see this Chilton in the rack, walk up to your car, start the engine, then push both fists directly into the fan until you can not feel your bones vibrate more. Make sure you have your wallet on hand too because you were going to waste money anyway. You may also have the privilege of wasting it. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw this after a "friend" of mine sent his girlfriend so I could see. He came, so did she. What's worse is she had to watch this $% & @ thing TWICE! I've heard your married now and he can visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
