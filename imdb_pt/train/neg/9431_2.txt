Basic premise of the horror movie, 3 young people ruin your car and end up with a frightening family. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Watching 36 minutes of a premonition of OJ car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Old lady with hot and cold insanity controlling her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes watching the actors eat - YAWN Trying to identify what the hell they're eating ... OK, there may be a drinking game here ... no - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free bath scenes ... Okay, I have my interest for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Completely random and uninspired murders ... YAWN <br /> <br /> The end ... man! that psycho is demented - why the rest of the movie could not be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately that's it - My advice - move on to the last five minutes and watch this and then put something good on the player - I'm going back to sleep for myself.
