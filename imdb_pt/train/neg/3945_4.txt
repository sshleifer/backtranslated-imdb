My Name is Modesty is a low budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's just not what I was expecting or waiting for. Although I have been aware of the character Modesty Blaise for years, I am not very familiar with comics or graphic novels, so I am entering this film as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is directed by dialogue. I suppose I was looking for something with a bit more value than camping. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deadly serious movie. There are very few, if any, "light" moments. The performance, at least of Alexandra Staden, is acceptable, but nothing exceptional. As others have commented, she seems a bit too fragile to be completely convincing in the title role. What action scenes exist in My Name is Modesty is one of the weakest points of the film. I never got the notion that this woman could handle a bunch of trained killers. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumors a big budget movie based on the character Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that the concept has a lot of potential and I look forward to it very eagerly.
