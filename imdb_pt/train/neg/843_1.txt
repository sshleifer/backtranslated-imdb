A Los Angeles BDSM subculture serves as a backdrop for this low-budget and embarrassing mess, clearly a piece of vanity for Celia Xavier, who also produces and writes while playing a dual role as Vanessa's twin sisters. and Celia. It then becomes a question of whether camera pyrotechnics, illumination, and rather unreasonable editing can reach a point of connection with a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensitive viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated parole officer for the Los Angeles County while her grumpy twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances on CD-ROMs but when disaster strikes "Mistress Vanessa," virtuous Celia, determined to unearth her sister's vicious aggressor, begins a new job as a "sex slave" at the private Castle Club, where the house specialty is a "dungeon feast." Two FBI field agents (whose location in Vanessa's case is allegedly necessary due to their involvement with BDSM Internet sites), as well as a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while striving to provide security to Celia. The enthusiastic performance of her new vocation is eagerly regarded by her clients as having created conditions of personal danger for her. Flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide being allocated to the Operations-South Bureau of LA, a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the film's configuration. Direction is blurred and is not aided by erratic editing of post-production and sound reproduction. The aforementioned photographic gymnastics culminates in a crazy setup near the end of the film, which is tangentially related to the scenery. A solid performance appears among this scum: Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent.
