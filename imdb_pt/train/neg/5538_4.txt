This is not really a zombie movie, if we're defining zombies like the dead walking around. Here the protagonist, Armand Louque (played by an incredibly young Dean Jagger), gains control of a method to create zombies, although his 'method' is to mentally project his thoughts and control the mind of other living people turning them into hypnotized slaves . This is an interesting concept for a film, and was done much more effectively by Fritz Lang in his series of 'Dr. Mabuse films including 'Dr. Mabuse the Gambler '(1922) and' The Testament of Dr. Mabuse '(1933). Here, unfortunately, he is subordinate to his quest to regain the love of his ex-fiancee, Claire Duvall (played by Anne Heche with a bad hairstyle, Dorothy Stone), which is really the main theme. <br /> <br /> The film has an intriguing start, as Louque is sent on a military archeological expedition to Cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there. In some type of compound (where we get incredible clothes and clothes) he announces his engagement to Claire, and just five minutes later, she returns her ring declaring her love for her friend Clifford Greyson (Robert Noland). It's funny how they talk without making eye contact. This would have been a great movie for the 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' if they had not already baked it. <br /> <br /> It is never shown how Louque actually learns the secret of 'buzzing', but he then uses it. to kill his enemies, create a gigantic army of rifles carrying soldiers and body guards. We will not see such great willpower until John Agar in 'The Brain of Planet Arous' (1957). <br /> <br /> Finally Claire agrees to marry him if he lets Greyson live and return to America. Louque agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves. On her wedding night, he realizes that Claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his "powers." To win his love, he does so, causing the "revolt" of the title, in which all his slaves awaken and attack his complex and kill him. Greyson hugs Claire, and it seems that we are at the end of a parable: "Who the gods would destroy, they would first go mad." <br /> <br /> So, actually, it's not that bad, despite the low popularity of IMDb that you currently have. In repeated visions (?) You can see the art in the script well formed! Dean Jagger had yet to turn into a good actor, and is almost unrecognizable in his youth - is that really his own hair? We remember him more for his bald and old roles in 'White Christmas' (1954), 'X The Unknown' (1956) and 'King Creole' (1958). The story lends many of his basic themes to the Halperin brothers, the previous film 'White Zombie' (1932) in which Robert Frazier (as Charles Beaumont) uses 'zombification' to win the love of Madge Bellamy (as Madeline Parker) <br /> <br /> If you want real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds!), I would start with 'White Zombie' (1932), 'King of the Zombies' (1941), 'I Walked With A Zombie' , 'The Night of the Living Dead' (1968), 'The Last Man of the Earth' (1964) and his two remakes. In the modern era of class films, there are "Horror Express" (1972), "The Serpent and the Rainbow" (1988), "28 Days Later" (2002) and its sequel as well as many, many others. numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> This is not really a zombie movie. Judging this movie on its own terms, it's more of a semi-gothic novel. As such, it ranks somewhat below some of the B horror movies, the band, the late 30's and early 40's. So I'm going to give 5.
