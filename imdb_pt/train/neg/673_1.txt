... let me tell you the ways. <br /> <br /> 1. A title-only remake that extracts all the clich√©s from the slasher manual. <br /> <br /> 2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or emotion. <br /> <br /> 4. A PG-13 rating that does not guarantee blood, violence or sex. <br /> <br /> 5. A villain who is neither scary nor mysterious. <br /> <br /> 6. A cast of characters that are so finely written and stereotyped that we could not care less about them. <br /> <br /> 7. The lack of a really scary atmosphere (very different from the Original Night Prom). <br /> <br /> 8. A script of dialogue that is beyond the poor - is mind numbing. <br /> <br /> 9. A series of cardboard performances (I'm not sure if I should blame the actors or the awful script for it). <br /> <br /> 10. A complete remake of slasher aimed at teenagers who is not brave enough to try to have an imagination - or even to show a pool of blood. <br /> <br /> You're a horror fan, save your money. /> <br /> BOMB out of ****
