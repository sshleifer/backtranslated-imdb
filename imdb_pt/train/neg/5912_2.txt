Having enjoyed Mike Myers' previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations for a parody of 60's titles were quite high. It became clear, after the first minute, that this was an exercise in being as childish and unpleasant as possible. I hung up after ten minutes. I watched the other day a second time to see if I had been unfair the first time. I hung up after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve-year-old could find this funny. Dialogue is a problem, Myers is painful to watch (like Heather Graham) and the succession of characters, including Fat Bastard, makes things even worse. In addition to the lightly entertaining title and psychedelic scene, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I personally recommend that you avoid this like the plague, although several friends of mine have liked it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).
