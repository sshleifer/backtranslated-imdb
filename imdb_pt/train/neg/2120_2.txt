I considered myself rather melancholy, especially when I was watching big, touching, rough movies. But not for this (which surprised me!) And it's also really amazing for me to see how many people praised this movie so highly. <br /> <br /> There are several disturbing facts throughout the films: 1. Despite the guilt Ben's true intention of saving 7 lives to rescue his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems to encourage this kind of suicidal action. Some people may realize that this is heroic action and others think he behaves cowardly; in the end, that was a disturbing action for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot of the film is over-dramatized, but the logic is oversimplified. Medically, blood type is required to be an organ donor. Towards the end of the film, we learned that Emily had a back blood type that limited her chance of getting the donor within a short period of time. However, it seemed that Ben had a rare blood type, just like hers, which allowed him to be his giver, and conveniently, despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he donated not only his heart, but also his kidney, his cornea . and its bone marrow, which in all cases requires not only the corresponding blood type, but also the tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to be donated, despite the jellyfish poison he used to kill? <br /> <br /> I could be analyzing the whole story, after all, it's just a movie. However, some troubling facts described above will probably help you reconsider your plan to watch this movie. If you go for a kind of soap opera movie, go ahead. But you'll look for smart entertainment, give this one the missing!
