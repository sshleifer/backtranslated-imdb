Although I never like being the kind of person who denies the personal taste of the other; if you like something, fine. But this movie was horrible and there's no way around it. I do not like Ani Difranco very much, but she is a great guitarist and composer, which I can admit. But I can not admit that there are redeeming qualities in this film. Many people like to accurately portray the problems faced by high school students. Maybe, but everything is portrayed exaggeratedly. There seems to be an attempt at "Naked Gun" - a kind of comedy, but the time is wrong; there is plenty of space between each line of actors, as if they were holding back the laughter (there were none). Who wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to put together so many controversial subjects in a film, almost never fully developing any of them (especially the girl getting pregnant from a teacher). I did not laugh once during this whole movie. I was very insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes to the screen.
