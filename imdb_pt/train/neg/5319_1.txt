Revenue from one of the worst movies of all time: a villain who seems to have escaped the WWF, has a terrible goal with a weapon that has inconsistent effects (the first guy she shoots catches fire, but when she shoots someone else they simply disappear) and takes time to pet a deer. Then you have the unpleasant characters, 30-year college students, a frustrated attempt at a surprise ending, and much, much more. Avoid at all costs.
