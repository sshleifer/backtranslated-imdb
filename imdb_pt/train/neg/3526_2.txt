(Spoiler included, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie can not be taken seriously. In some places, it's so stupidly stupid that I can not stop laughing at everything. Try me for the sequel in which the character of Stallone jumps about 20 feet with full climbing gear or (and this is actually my favorite) snuffs a bad guy by putting him in a stalactite. Yes, what impious force has he gathered to accomplish such feats? I do not know, but he sure gives a run for the money.
