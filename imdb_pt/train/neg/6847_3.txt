This was a movie that I wanted to watch whenever it was released Promos were attractive and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise <br /> <br /> But the movie is not so good <br /> <br /> There are many failures <br /> <br /> The beginning is good and even the murder all goes well, but the film fails when the romance begins between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow <br /> <br /> Then the twist on Govinda and Tabu are in love leaves more doubts and failures and then How does Govinda become a rich criminal of a poor villager? <br /> <br /> The last flashback is also prolonged and also the whole confrontation between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> N Chandra disappoints Music is well, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out <br /> < Govinda tries a negative role and gets along really well although she overdoes it sometimes Karisma is good, but annoys sometimes with her screams Tabu is alright Nirmal Pandey still does not know the difference between loud shouting and acting rest are oka and
