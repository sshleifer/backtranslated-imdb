Of the ten actors who played Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed the nicest, but in this script the audience is way ahead of the famous detective. After all, when the jockey, Douglas Walton, stares into space, obviously hypnotized, and says something like "I need to ride and be killed," I felt like a jerk no one noticed after he was killed. Police thought it was a suicide because he said he would do it! After hated horse owner Gene Lockhart is shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same thing, telling her that she is going to be killed and then fatally leaves a bus. I laughed when Lowe finally yells "I get it," as if it were a revelation. The guilty party, however, was cleverly concealed and there was considerable suspense generated when that part began to hypnotize Lowe to make him jump off a roof.
