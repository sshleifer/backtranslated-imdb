Oh, my God ... I thought CBS's television shows were the worst things that Gerald McRaney appeared in ... Four people are experienced by a crazed mind control. computer. That's it, do not rent it. <br /> <br /> I saw this under one of his many titles - "Gray Matter," and it is perhaps one of the worst recent memory films. The other comments are correct, it's awful. Never have so many unstable shots appeared on the screen, EVER. The cast is horrible, the direction is horrible and the script is horrible. I can not emphasize how horrible this is. <br /> <br /> Avoid as you would with smallpox. <br /> <br /> This is classified (PG) for physical violence, armed violence, mild <br /> gore, some profanity and some adult situations
