With an absolutely incredible cast and crew, this may have been a classic. Rather, it is a repetitive paraphrase of all the 1979 conspiracy theories about the gravely unsuccessful JFK murder in a vaguely incoherent plot about the assassination of the fictional president Kegan in 1960. Many superb character actors are wasted because they either are not given enough to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach for example, or they are asked to go a little more exaggeratedly - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins manage to absolve themselves very well in their very different ways, though. <br /> <br /> The picture is beautiful, but does not justify an hour and a half of your life, or the price of buying the DVD.
