This is undoubtedly the most offensive "girl movie" I've seen in years, if not always. The writing and the characterizations are so full of stereotypes that the movie borders the parody. Before we left the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster, we were subjected to the following themes: having a baby will solve all your problems, "performative types" are miserable messes, and musicians can not be good mothers unless they dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast and some great looks and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that unless she lived a more conventional life, she would end up shuddering - "alone!" I felt sick. I can not believe this movie has reached the theatrical release. It's the kind of fare you'd expect from the "women's" cable channels that I always get when I navigate the channel. I'm a woman and I'm over 35, so I should be part of the target audience of the movie, but man, "Evening" misses the mark.
