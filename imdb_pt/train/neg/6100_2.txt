Effort aside (This is not a review about good intentions, it's about the final product), this movie is poorly written, over-hyped and misdirected. The story, of course, had potential, but this story is not present anywhere in this movie. Clara Barton was a human being. She had passions, desires, love, pain, shame, weakness, and self-doubt, just like the rest of us. You would never know this in this movie about the performance of the lead actress. In fact, apply this to all the characters in the movie, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. An epic about the speech from above as if it were from an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well on one at the board meeting, and I figured it out because she's making a speech! Every idea she has is unbelievable in her context and she comes up with ideas that sound as if they take a lifetime of soul-searching in the hour. For example, when she sees a man injured, she will begin to pontificate on the needs of the battlefield and protect the soldiers and place white flags, etc. As played in the movie, there is no way she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie steals Clara Barton from her struggles. This robs her of her humanity, and that inherently weakens everything she has done, because the script is written in clich√©s. The writer does not know Clara Barton and seems to have based his script on an article in the Britannica encyclopedia. (yes they had those back then) But hey, Technicolor good! (Who cares)
