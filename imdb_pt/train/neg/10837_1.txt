I can not tell you how angry I was after seeing this movie. The characters are not at all interesting, and the plot is non-existent. So, after waiting to see how these characters' lives affected each other, hoping the last two and a half hours would lead to a meaningful end, what did we get? A frog storm. Now, I do understand the references to the Bible (Exodus) and the underlying theme, but first, it was presented with absolutely no resolution, and secondly it would be lost to anyone who has not read the Bible (a significant portion of the population ) or Charles Fort (an even larger portion). As a somewhat well read person, I thought this movie was a poor self-indulgent imitation of a seinfeld episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better to spend reading ... <br /> <br /> ... anything to be honest
