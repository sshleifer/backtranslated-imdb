To compare this misery with an old low budget porn movie would be an insult to the old low budget porn movie. The animal scenes have no meaning nor represent this man and his crimes, even in the broadest sense of abstractions. The synopsis on the back of the DVD says, in part, "retaining the reign of terror of BTK Killer". This is not a recount. A recount would suggest that you are being told the truth about what happened or how or why. None of these things is true. I am an enthusiastic scholar of serial killers and have seen some very bad movies about them and honestly, this is not one of them. That's not even about the BTK killer. Save some time and a few dollars and rent Dahmer. This serial killer movie is accurate and true. However, if you just have to see this movie for yourself, take a look for free at your local library and even then you will still feel cheated.
