Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you squint, and the light on the subject. But core accuracy is not a compensation for a dark, patchy and inconsistent plot with stacks of cardboard dialogues and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are merely characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes ranging from the 'enigmatic and noble' American Indians to the 'muffled but sadistic' English officers. A miserable and unworthy version of a fascinating period of American history. I want my money back.
