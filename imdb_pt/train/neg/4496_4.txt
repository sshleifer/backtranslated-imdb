This movie is a feast of bad acting and bad scene design, as well as cheeky lines and a lame plot. But it's a lot of fun to watch. Everything about it is hilarious. The basic plot is a group of future scientists who travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who wants to destroy them all. They reach it in the year 1146. The scientists' "futuristic" laboratory of the year 2033 is an eighteenth-century style room with a bunch of "futuristic" buttons and a time capsule that looks like a garden shed. The actors deliver their speeches with impudence without enthusiasm, which is not difficult to understand, considering that the lines are usually terrible as "I checked everything twice!" Did he check everything twice? Has he checked four times? Not only that, but they feed the whole premise of the film in the first five minutes, and continue at a rapid rate of fire until they reach the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And it had to stop traveling in time and consequently in different sets. The medieval ensemble is a hodgepodge of anything from the late 10th to the 16th century. Whatever costume they could find, they wore it. I guess mail was not in the budget, because all guys wear sequined shirts disguised as armor. The fight scenes are laughable, with men casually casting themselves in cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death bids without any blows. It looks really awful, but I like it every time I watch. The lines alone are enough for you to fit in and everything else joins together to create a fabulous B movie that, if you're a connoisseur of funny movies, I suggest you watch. And once you have it, read the commentary on unfamiliar movies. I love hearing them point out all the funny and truly awful parts of the movie.
