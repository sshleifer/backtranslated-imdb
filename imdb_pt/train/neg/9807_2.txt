Very rarely do I give less praise in a show or movie I do not like in IMDb, but the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is so terribly scary, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I would not have minded if that had happened. an animated series - would have been better that way, I think, but as a live action show, it typifies the terms "tacky" and "flamboyant." Of which Power Rangers is. Five multi-colored, teenagers wearing spandex fight evil, using their martial arts skills. The outfits are horrible - they look like something reminiscent of what athletic athletes and female gymnasts would wear. The acting is deplorable, and the choreography of the fight is so shockingly bad and so stupid to see, that it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme look as good as Bruce Lee, which is a euphemism in and of itself. In fact, they seem to be jumping and dancing; as if it were some version of 'Nutcracker', or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting. In addition, there are some cartoons that strongly characterize martial arts and it is still done in a fun but not so tacky way that makes it sound silly. <br /> <br /> Children show or not, this is so lame and on the edge of the absurd. And even though this version is set in the United States, you may be forgiven for thinking that while watching some of the fighting sequences, they were not filmed in the US, but in Japan; so the fight and the "fake" scenes were borrowed from the Japanese version - just to be juxtaposed to the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of thing, stick with Sentai - the Japanese equivalent.
