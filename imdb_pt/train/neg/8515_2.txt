I was so disappointed with this show. After hearing and reading all the commotion about this, as it was an "innovative show" and all sorts of wild promises if quality, I tried to watch. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment! The performance was forced and exaggerated. The story made very little sense. As for any hint of "looking at teenagers' lives," I could only see an insignificant attempt that had as much reality as a reality show. <br /> <br /> Some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that, in fact, it's not so good, and drumming the quality drummer on this show serves only to draw attention to how badly done it is.
