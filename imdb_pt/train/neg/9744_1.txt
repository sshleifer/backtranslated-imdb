This is one of the worst things that has ever come out of England, so that says a lot here. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is hosted is incredible. On the plus side is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, at her picnic table printing underwear for some time after being captured by Dr. Mouse's face. This film has several visions of London as well, although none of them is good. There is also a point where there is almost a car accident that causes your heart rate to return to normal. There is also a clock that is teleported away, and the woman's fear of not seeing it parallels the horror of "The Sixth Sense," only much more monotonous and British. Add a furious weapons fight between the British police and Dr. Rat, which results in nothing but the electrocuting of many people, plus a cat and yourself ... ummm ... A British movie. The MST3K version is very good, although none of them is the best.
