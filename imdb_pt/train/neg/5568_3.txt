Dolph Lundgren stars as a former police / boxer who seeks out the perverted Boston scene to find out who killed his brother who was well thought of in the community, yet along the way he learns how his brother enjoyed bizarre sex and what a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this film, in fact, based on his performance here, would forget the rise of Lundgren to fame involved in action roles. That said, the material gives Lundgren nothing to work on, in fact, Lundgren is completely left to dry in a dark thriller that is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact, the film works best when focusing around the chemistry of Lundgren and Brett, in fact, the film took the time to explore their relationship the film would have been quite decent. However, the film is mediocre, the action is non-existent, the plot is not exploited enough (Lundgren's much boring investigation into his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily bloody and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is actually quite good (as is newcomer Danielle Brett), but the film only moves from one sequel to the next, which makes this movie particularly disappointing. However, if it shows anything else, how underrated Lundgren is, as an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (Bad)
