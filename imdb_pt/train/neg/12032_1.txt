This movie was awful. I had a really hard time watching this all the time. I did not understand the point of the movie. What was the purpose of this film? The soundtrack was poor, the acting was poor and the story uninspired. The two main characters in the film were very boring and their dialogue was uninteresting. There was no chemistry between cast members. I do not know that, but I suspect most actors were newbies. The film could have easily been reduced to about an hour and a half without losing the plot. This indicates how many useless scenes there were in the film. I'd rather have a root canal during the two hours of the movie. I want those two hours back! If you want to watch a good and funny movie that is familiar and made by a bunch of Mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite.
