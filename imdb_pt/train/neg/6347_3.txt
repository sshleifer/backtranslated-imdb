I'll probably always see a Woody Alleb movie, as you never know when it can make a real comeback to your past greatness. Just one or two great moments or lines may be worth it. unfortunately, however, this movie does not do this on any score. Saying that really makes me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my reaction is a lot like many other Woody fans, but what can you say? It is probably time for him to focus on his Clarinett, which in my opinion, is quite good. Saying all this, I'll probably go to any new movie that Woody might release in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect WOODY !!
