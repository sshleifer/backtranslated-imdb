... or an audience. A quick recap .... <br /> <br /> So you have this doctor who is experiencing stolen body parts for some vague reason. He wants to perfect the transplants, but he thinks he needs to do it in the basement. WTF ??? And then, all of a sudden, unfortunately, and conveniently, her fiancé cuts her head off in a traffic accident for which HE is responsible. Agonized with sadness, he preserves his head in a pot of lasagna (or is it strudel?) And the full pump of "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep it alive. And then she wakes up, talking outside her head (so to speak) even though her neck has obviously been severed from the vocal cords, and she has no lungs, so she could not speak, even if she had them. It seems that the ingrate does not like everything his fiancé did for her. Exactly like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his pain turns into horny when he sees the possibility of grafting the head of his beloved into the body of the first despicable prostitute that can catch on the street. Meanwhile, the doctor's assistant, a kind of dime shop, goes into philosophical arguments with his head, which began a telekinetic friendship with the "monster in the closet" (every mad scientist has one). Eventually the screenwriter realizes that he can not continue to inflict his misogyny and fear of intimacy problems in the public ad infinitum, so he kills everyone, so he presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the film's financiers have a chance to stop the payment . in him. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that I think this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> One should tell Turner Classic Movies to stop showing the edited version without the bloody stuff. The assistant's view with his arm ripped out, spinning around the house without leaving much blood anywhere, is simply too precious.
