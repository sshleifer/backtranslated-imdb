The first one was different and fun. That attempt should never have left the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. It's a weak attempt at rude humor. The movie selects current and old movies to be stolen. This time the jokes seem worn and exaggerated. The audience I saw just re-acted to the scene of Hannibal's dinner and was asleep.
