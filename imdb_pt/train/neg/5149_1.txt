This movie is about a rape / comic book victim from New York who decides to escape all that glamor of the big city and move to a dirty, run-down town where she finds refuge in a single trailer on a dirt road. very in the middle of the 12th and nowhere. The townspeople are mentally ill, but she's also inviting crazy men into her trailer. Irritating is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to put herself in dangerous circumstances after dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was at most high school. He's one of those cute little actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career has not been kind and mother nature is on the right track. To the previous commenter stating that the performance was "so real", well, I agree. He was not really acting. The two main characters are pathetic, weak, and unable to make healthy, mature decisions. In short, this movie sucks, rent it to laugh at it. The real crime scene? The heinous wooden panels in the trailer-enough to make me commit murder. And finally, she's an artist / writer, so she could not afford a double trailer and something other than a Chevy Chevette yellow-sun for goodness sake!
