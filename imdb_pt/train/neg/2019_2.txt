Oh dude, this sucked sucked .... I could not even get any value camping out of this ...... and I sat through the whole thing on Showtime .... Do not bother to wait for the 'bare scenes' as well. .. it's too late and only Jenna Jameson of plastic is involved. It shows how much discretionary money must be around Hollywood just to get its name on the final credits. I think Showtime had to release something at 1 am ... Next time I think I'd rather watch ESPN loop every 30 minutes ...
