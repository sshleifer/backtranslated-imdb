Based on a self-serving novel by a friend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this useless story. Gregory Peck remains in shameless excess as a strong alcoholic alcoholic; in contradiction to the gentle and gentle spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on the era of Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing at the end of his life, the very honored author was actually living a quiet life and struggling effectively against his alcoholism at a time when AA was still not well known. Fitzgerald was not proud to recycle his honeyed stories to support his wife (in a psychiatric hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a Chevrolet second hand, his life was 180 degrees different from the one pictured in this movie. Virtually every 20th Century Fox movie made during the leadership of Daryll F. Zanuck, as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King, was a work of excellence. The infidel beloved was the exception.
