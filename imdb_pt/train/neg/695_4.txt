I heard a lot about this movie as it was a great slasher and one of those 80's movies that die hard fans of most horror movies just had to see. Well, I rented it and I have to say that although I kept my eye on suspense for most horror movies like "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night", this movie might be right up there with the aforementioned just lacked real enthusiasm and potential of the characters as well as the ongoing story. Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weird guy with the curly hair that kept crawling around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the finale with him facing the killer. Another would be the dirty, scruffy guy with the denim jacket, he could have played more roles in that movie that could have made the movie more interesting, instead the movie interpreted this guy as just another loser making unknown connections while he slept. with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts it to the end, which was a waste, I was disappointed in his part in the end. As far as the true identity of the killer, when identity was revealed about who he was, I just laughed but everything was obvious and he really made a real jerk out of himself as well as a boring character after his true intentions were revealed. This movie should be a watch at least once for all fans of slasher, but do not spend your hard earned money on some rare inventory and hard to find collectors.
