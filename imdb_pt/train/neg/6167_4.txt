Like most people, I was drawn to buy this movie because of the photos of the mighty Bun Yeung plastered across the box, and the assumption (from the above mentioned photos and movie title) that this movie is about the Beast of the butt of the East for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, to my disappointment, the Chinese Hercules is for Yeung Cake what No Retreat No Surrender was for Jean Claude Van Damme and the Fearless Tiger went to ... erm, Bun Yeung - maximum exposure in the video box, minimum real screen time! Oh well! The plot is pretty basic, but it was well done - a peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again. He then flees to work as a workman on a pier, where he impresses his co-workers with his heavy-bag lifting prowess, making them suspect he is a formidable fighter (I'm not sure how that works, but it does not matter) . Meanwhile, the corrupt commander of the pier makes a deal with gangsters, giving them exclusive use of the pier. As a result, workers are tossed in the ear and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their boss, the gangster boss and his Yeung Bong Yeung. <br /> <br /> While the film was quite watchable (mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of Bolo), I had some problems with it - first of all, bad dubbing, but of course that's a given in old kung fu movies. But also, the film tended to drag itself between the various scenes of struggle. As for the fight scenes, I found them very long, poorly choreographed (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Poorly filmed and sometimes performed by people who did not seem to have any martial arts skills .... in fact, most fights in this movie were not 'fights', only people being beaten without offering any resistance! <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero - played by Chen Hui Min. I've never seen any other movie with this guy, but in no time I was rooting for him. Not only did he look weak and on the verge of tears at all times, but I found his insistence on not irritating fighting! I understood his reasoning but he could have spared a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he would eventually do, and fight! A great mystery was why this entire community of people was putting their hopes in a face they never saw fight! <br /> <br /> Actually, the great saving grace in this movie was the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is he as massive and brutal as ever, he has some great, funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a master-class on how to fight in the movie. The guy exudes screen presence and you can easily see how he has become a star. The guy scares the life out of me, but I'm sure I was not the only person to have watched this movie that I was cheering for Bolo during the entire final fight! <br /> <br /> In short, a below-average kung-fu movie has raised several huge points because of you-know-who. I've never met a person who did not think Bolo Yeung was great. Man is a legend !!
