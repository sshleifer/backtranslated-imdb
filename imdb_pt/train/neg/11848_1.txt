What is supposed to be a simple generic plot of mystery involving a dead philanthropist is actually a head inducing tale about a lot of characters (the only great actor being Ginger Rogers in a very precocious role) all trying to find the killer among a small cast of locals in an elegant building. These characters range from completely stupid to frank. As a cheap, low-budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and his protagonist (a guy, I do not care who he is because he really sucked) talking about his various possibilities of resolving crime while constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head on his ass. Honestly, I've never had a worse time watching an old movie of this kind, and I've seen some real scammers head on. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the butler did not do it. because there was no butler. But pay attention to the face of a butler. There you go. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
