No one should try to adapt a book by Tom Robbins to the screen. While the movie is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well for reading, sucks when spoken. Or, to put it another way, no one could suggest that hearing someone else's name was like seeing her written on a radio in a pearl. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looks like an ill-adapted cliff. Notes to the book - most parts have been cut up to a fifth of their size in the book, in terms of current history and history, and the ending is uncontrollably (and unpleasantly) different from the book. Most of the book's tangles get lost, including what makes everything make sense at the end, and there is more of a reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "Huh?" It's not a worthy effort, unfortunately - the script should have been read, compared to the book, burned out and all the actors sent to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously, but not even someone of his caliber could have made a decent movie from such a complex book without doing a miniseries.
