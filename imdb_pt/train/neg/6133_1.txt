Kurt Thomas stars as Jonathan Cabot a kind of gymnast who trains for a special game that involves being hunted by a group of ninjas, but these ninjas will not stand a chance, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! Taken as a whole Gymkata is a bad movie, the atrocious acting, the horrible script and the really incompetent direction make the quality below human standards, however this film is so terrible that it becomes really funny. I mean, with dialogues like "I know I'm going to lose them!" or "Ha !, your means!" add only to the simulated value that Gymkata gets more. In addition, it is (wisely) the only movie that has as hero a gymnast who finds things to sway in the heat of the moment.
