Joel Schumaker directs the script he co-wrote and has a group of graduates in Georgetown confronted with adulthood situations. The plot is a mess, but some scenes are good. There's a lot of talent and time wasted here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Featured are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Est√©vez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. Most notable are McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is pretty nasty. Getting old is not so easy.
