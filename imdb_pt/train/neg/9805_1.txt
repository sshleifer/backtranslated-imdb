I never quite understood the popularity of Saban's Power Rangers program, which was simply an Americanized second-rate version of Japan's ultra-popular super sentai series of the last three decades! What was cool about the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course many kids will say that Power Rangers are the greatest, but they would be incorrect. /> <br /> I'm sure if they spoke Japanese, they would learn how much super sentai is better than the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers is completely horrible, try Super Sentai! Looking for a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension!
