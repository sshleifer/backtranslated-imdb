This was really a really bad movie. I am a big fan of Horror Italian, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two Demons movies to be fun - they were so bad they were great, but it's so bad it's really, really bad. It's intensely annoying, the story is never going anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife beating her husband and the tearful baby pain in the fucked wife drove me crazy, there was nowhere near the story devoted to the Ogre that was probably the best actor throughout the film. I hung up about three-quarters of the way because I was very, very bored! Do not bother yourself.
