I remember this show being shown on TV when I was a child in the early 1990s, and there was this fury about kids with freaks doing kung fu on each other and walking on plastic dinosaurs. It was called power rangers. I remember little kids popping around and then the shirts and show stuff were banned in many school districts across the country because this show taught kids to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> I never thought of it as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids. Most older teens have always looked at the power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful way, and it's not hard to imagine why. Filming is ridiculous at best. The colorful ranger outfits look like things you'd work on and dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you get to act and of course those really laughable haircuts. All guys run with earrings, half of them wear '90s robes, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then switch knit using power rangers. <br /> <br /> Toys are especially ridiculous too. and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts. And of course two of the worst movies ever made, and I really mean that two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show, with almost all the critics destroying the movies and the shows it was based on. <br /> <br /> Power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commercial for a particularly bad toy merchandising. As an adult, I do not look at him fondly, but as another embarrassment of the 1990s children's shows, fashion and boys earrings.
