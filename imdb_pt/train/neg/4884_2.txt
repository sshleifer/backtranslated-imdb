Criminally Insane 2 is included in Satan's new Black Wedding / Criminally Insane DVD, and it's a good thing too, because when I saw a movie and I know there's a sequel (especially something that's as obscure as that) I'm always curious. I have now had my curiosity satisfied and will never attend to it again. Most of CI2 is nothing more than "flashbacks" to CI, and footage of Ethel sleeping, remembering good memories, I think. Thanks to Proposition 13, she is released from the state of Napa (imagine if she could see The Cramps playing while she was there?) And sent to a house run by a nice old woman whom Ethel readily calls "grandma." All this is shot with a video camera, so the picture and sound are quite pathetic, and are still complete with some "rolls". Of course Ethel does her thing, which is to dispatch anyone between her and food, especially the guy who witnesses one of his acts of disorder and extorts his dessert. Also, you should ask yourself about any intermediate home for murderers who have a large drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink. I think it's all a matter of mistaken "trust." If you liked or did not like Criminally Insane, anyway there's no good reason to watch this, except out of curiosity. One wonders why the makers of this have cared. 2 out of 10.
