Very funny to watch "Beretta's Island" as a kind of natural junk movie. It's as a response to b-movie type by Jess Franko. Bodybuilders counterattack (! Face to face!) To shooters. The strike very very much Stupid! : Unbelievably bad shooting directed scenes (shooting) looks even better than melee fighting.Snoriously ridiculous scenes.Saving beauties incredibly stupid scenes.Erotic scenes are very unerotic.The main draw of the film is quite scenery and scenes from the festival. Do not miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's joke at the beginning of the film and the list of relatives of Franco Columbu at the end. Special attraction: naked breast. Something else forgot - Franco can sing!
