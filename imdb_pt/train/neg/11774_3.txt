He made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was well filmed from the beginning, but this is the last positive comment I have about the movie. The acting was horrible, I wonder if real gogo girls were hired? But it was the storyline that was really laughable, in fact, that was laughable and not annoying is the only reason I gave this 3/10. <br /> ** Spoilers below **. <br /> <br /> I just want to mention some of the scenes that really made the audience laugh: <br /> <br /> Pushing the girl in the field: who would have thought that a child pushing another child could be represented? seriously. A real eye-opener. <br /> <br /> The bus scene: the girl is getting on the bus. But according to music, the world is ending. <br /> <br /> Scrolling under the clothesline: Wow, this one actually demonstrates the writer's skills. In the room, followed by raw meat and selling skill. Why not just make her perform all three "sins" at one go? At least the film could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> The down stairs of the mall: watch as one of the girls tries to descend the stairs pursued by a meat eating Dau, without waiting. she * is * just walking quickly trying not to break her nails. <br /> <br /> The Blood-Covered Race: This is definitely my favorite scene, and an appropriate ending to the movie. A half marathon of red paint, completed up the stairs and across the bridge, only to be sent flying unreal by a passing car. Not only that, but this suicide is performed by the most obsessed girl in the movie, now that she's staying true to her character. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that this film was created for a year of 16 years. old man and his companions. Unfortunately, having encountered the director in the presentation, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> But if you're in a sarcastic mood, and you like to laugh with some friends .. so do not even think about it yet.
