I can not believe this movie was allowed to be made. These people should be drugged and hit with blunt objects. They must be tortured. This movie is an abomination. It's nothing more than footage from the first movie. Everything that is original is strange and makes no sense at all. It's kind of like a drug hallucination. Like naked treatment of a mirror. Besides, any idiot who got that shit together did not even bother watching the first movie because they kept calling Suzanna Love's character Natalie when it's Lacey. I felt like screaming this on the screen: "It's LACEY, there's LACEY !!!!". I give -50 out of 10. MY GOD !!!!
