I rarely write reviews for the filmmaker, but I feel compelled to warn prospective viewers that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies. (I'm not a hater.), and I had high expectations for this since I found him listed on many "Top 10 Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" sites. (Now I'm convinced that these top 10 lists are all the cut and paste tasks). Firstly, there is almost no action in the movie. Most of the film consists of talking about the plot, which is an incredible feat because it is fine at best. And the action itself may have been impressive in 1978, but it is routine by today's standards. A special alert for Netflix users: the DVD they send is terrible; the image is horrible and is not even 16: 9 improved.
