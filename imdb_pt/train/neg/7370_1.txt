I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and although most are not great, or even good, this smoking stack has lowered the standard for bad movies. <br /> <br /> The plot: I'm not sure. Something about a drug that makes you crazy and strong or something. Who are the good and the bad? Hard to say. Most of the movie is between choppy scenes between people in dark rooms complaining about how good Seagals character "Mashall" is. <br /> <br /> Performance: Beating. <br /> <br /> Voiceover What was it with the horrible voice overdubbing?! Could they find someone who sounded less like Seagal? Also could have Cheech or Chong doing voice overs, could at least be fun then. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring, and completely stupid. Avoid at all costs !!!!
