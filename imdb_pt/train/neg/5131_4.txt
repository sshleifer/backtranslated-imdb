I liked it, but I think I could have ironed it at the same time. This rewording of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a stereotypical and undemanding romcom rescued from direct ignominy to the video at its launch by Janeane Garofalo's sharp turn. Playing Frasier for pets, she finds herself trapped in love when insecurity drives her to spend her best friend (Uma Thurman) as herself when an interlocutor comes to court. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film in Ben Chaplin's fascinating career. An ordinary British actor, he gave Hollywood a chance with this movie. He is not noteworthy and his anonymity in studio productions is not surprising based on this, although he has appeared in substantial appearances in both later films of Terence Malick. Uma Thurman makes a turn on autopilot and Michael Lehmann brings everything together competently. Sex with the cell phone Icky though. 4/10
