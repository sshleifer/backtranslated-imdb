Do not listen to the misleading title "Werewolf Woman". Europeans are well known for putting emphasis on sex and nudity over real scares in their horror films, but this one is a little too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have had a contemptuous sex scene with the title character going mad and brutally killing her partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of it becomes very monotonous quickly. She's not even a werewolf, but a little schizophrenic girl whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can not even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being a legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in a classic after that) for a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured for a revenge thriller. In the end, the director insists that this is based on a true story. Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some interesting aspects of production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are some gore effects and nudity scenes. However, these become quite monotonous quickly. Also, the dubbed dialogue box is quite hilarious on a camping way, especially the most swinging doctor in the world (he drinks at work). Unfortunately, the film becomes very annoying. There is no real plot or anything else really. It's a shame, because reading a description, I felt the movie had some real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is very time-consuming, slow and a bit pointless, even for the standards of the exploit genre. (4/10)
