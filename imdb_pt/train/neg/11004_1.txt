It really strikes me that it was done. The director / writer / actor must really be charismatic in reality. I can not think of another way to pass the script stage. What I want you to consider is this ... while watching the movies, I was sorry for the actors. It seemed to be in a comedy club standing where the guy is dying standing up and you're sitting there, not liking it, just feeling really bad for him having to try. I really like to know what the budget is, I think it must have been low as the movie quality is very poor. I want to write "the jokes did not attract me". but the reality is that they appeal to you, you would have to be the man who wrote them. or a retard. So, imagine this in script form ... and this guy has that green on. That's impressive, is not it?
