When 'My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu' aired last season, I was pleased. Scrubs, I thought, are doing something clever and unique with regards to the clip-show concept. Instead of repeating filming, they are repeating jokes in a self-conscious way, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I found it very unfortunate that I was wrong. One season later, they succumbed to what almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the clip shows ... and it looked like it was ridden by the boy's work experience. Dr. Cox's shaved head shows how lazy the editors were riding, since it does not appear again until 'My Long Goodbye' a 4 episodes later. I can not imagine that a wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well built sitcom. Who knows why it was put there, it seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (in large part) of the episodes that aired last year. <br /> <br /> Three seconds clips together with background music is an extra DVD for a (very) rainy day, not a prime-time television episode.
