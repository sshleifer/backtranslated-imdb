Unfortunately, this has been shown at Star Movies here in Thailand during the last week. It's a complete trash action. As another member said, this movie is a good example of "how not to act". I have not seen such a badly acted movie in a long time. The actors (can you call them 'actors'?) Are completely flat and deliver their speeches with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that to really understand how bad the acting is, you would have to see the movie ... but that would be similar to torture. <br /> <br /> I shrink when the protagonist delivers her lines. and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or invented) is equally heinous. Another actress with the fake British accent was pretty, yes, but good sir was her terrible accent. Mix it with her (lack of) acting and you will have a disaster. She should have just said nothing and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl. Oh my, we just got to the scene where the main lady's lover says "Really me?" after a scene of forced crying from her. Laughable. No, really, I just laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> Sets and art directors offer some saving grace to the film. Some of the scenarios are colorful and some of the scenes are cool (minus the actors). <br /> <br /> The old magic potion? What?! Another member mentioned the 'modern' love song that was in the film. Totally inappropriate for a part from a period started some 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered 'Big Budget' in Thailand at the time of its production. I would be seriously annoyed if I was the producer of this movie. This shows that money does not necessarily make a good movie (or even mediocre). <br /> <br /> I would give the Creator King a 1 in 10, but the costumes and scenarios save the film a rating. 2 out of 10.
