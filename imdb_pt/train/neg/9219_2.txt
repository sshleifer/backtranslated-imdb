I did not even know that this was originally a made-for-TV movie when I saw it, but I guessed it during the runtime. It has the same faded colors, bland characters and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80s, plus a "social platform" that practically screams "Afterschool special." Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe's Labyrinths and Monsters (thanks) were made at the height of Dungeons & Dragons, a pen and paper RPG that has conquered millions of geeks in the United States. I consider myself one of the geeks, although I have never played D & D specifically, I became interested in one of his brothers. M & M was also made at the height of the great D & D controversy - it was so engaging that people could lose touch with reality, worshiping Satan without knowing, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point, if extremely rare - but this movie dates awfully. <br /> <br /> We met 4 young college students, who play the appropriately named Labyrinths and Monsters, to socialize and take a little time away from mundane life. Except that M & M as presented is more annoying than their mundane lives. Nothing of the fascination of the games is presented here - and Jay Jay's request to take M & M into the "real world" comes out of nowhere. It's just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere - even though at this point we do not mind. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel are supposedly different - but they are all lazy rich who have problems that no one really has. <br /> <br /> But things continue, getting worse in more ways than one. . The low budget comes terribly clear, (I love the 'sign' sign and cardboard clipping to the forbidden caves) Robbie / Pardu shows why he is not a warrior in the fastest stabbing scene of all time, and payment on the 'Two Towers' is involuntarily Hilary. Tom Hanks's excrement "Jay Jay, what am I doing here?" made me laugh for minutes on end. Definitely the low point of his career. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it as a convincing satire, just a laughable part of the 80's TV junk, and you're still going to have fun. That is, if you can stay awake. Most are boring, but worth it for the collapse of Pardu in the end. At least Tom Hanks got better. Not that he could go much worse from here.
