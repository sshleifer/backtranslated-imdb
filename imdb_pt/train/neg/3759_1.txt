Oh where to start. Cinematography was great. When the film started, because of the early scenes of the landscape, I thought I was in a good movie. Then the cgi Bigfoot appeared. It looked like a cartoon drawing of King Lion and King Kong's love son. It totally took away the credibility of the character. Now I knew there was not a Bigfoot chasing people walking through the forest for no apparent reason but a cgi cartoon. So the whole movie was filmed for me. The money they threw in the toilet for the cgi they could spend on a costume like Roger Patterson's. He was the best Bigfoot outfit anyone could match. I'm a bigfoot hardcore fan and was warned about this movie, but my compulsion led me to watch this movie and was disappointed as the previous reviews alerted me. I know that once you read this review, you will still say "I need to see the Sasquatch hunters, I need to observe the Sasquatch hunters." So you'll say why I wasted my good money on such a boring movie!
