It's sad when you can see what a movie was trying to do, and it's pretty obvious that it fell far short of the mark. Film students should consider this as a lesson and a warning. It would be formed has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces his cinematic masterpiece alone. Usually, your concept is way beyond your budget. Usually he writes an exaggerated script full of all the sloges he can create. Usually, he is more interested in the great sweep of the story than in the intimate of working with actors in individual scenes. Usually, he ends up with a movie that is weak in its attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget. Usually, it ends with a series of encounters (we can not do it justice by calling them scenes) that seem to have been written by a 12-year-old. And usually he ends up with misinterpreted scenes that can not catch the viewer. When you look at the Judges from this perspective, you can immediately say that it is just the usual fare.
