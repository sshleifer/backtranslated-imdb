Wanda Nevada is a fantasy pubescent movie that uses ideas from 1979 about what constitutes illicit romance for 13-year-old girls. Script, rhythm and direction are uniformly awful. Strings of action defy belief. The characters speak with the simplified diction normally found in 10-set films, but also includes multiple sexual references involving the character of Shields as well as graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be a comedy on some level, but it's never funny, an adventure movie, but plot and action are insipid, and a children's movie, but introduces pedophilia and child rape as possibilities real. He also wants to be a photo of friends, a picture about his age, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travel diary and a western. The overall effect is massive stupidity with an unpleasant twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time, unless you want to see many good scenes of the Grand Canyon. Which you can do very well.
