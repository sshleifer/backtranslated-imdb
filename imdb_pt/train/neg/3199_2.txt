Joe Don Baker. He was great in "Walking Tall" and had a good part in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice" all hope was gone ... the black side won. <br /> <br /> As with most of humanity, my main experience with this was in MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots sink their claws into Baker's flesh and pierce that movement completely. It's obvious they were just getting started with "Mitchell" in his anti-Joe kick and here's his continuation on a theme. <br /> <br /> But it's a funny experience: there are many riffs of choice. My favorite - "John Rhys-Davies on sale," "It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'," "none of them are worthy of sponge," "Why she was wearing her prom dress in bed," and my favorite - <br /> <br /> By itself, "Final Justice" is, as Joe Don puts it in the film, "a big fat nothing". But here, in fact, has some entertainment value. You have a chance, get this version of "Ultimate Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Ultimate Justice". Ten for the MST3K version ONLY. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
