This movie is just another ordinary action movie, but it could have been so much better. When the guns came out, they really needed some choreography help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who did that brilliant action sequence in Heat as he went up the street from the assault - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the movie was good - predictable but watchable - better than you'd expect from that kind of movie. Then came the final scene, the show-down, what we were expecting, but it was like watching something from A-Team in the 80's. They shoot violently, nothing hits, and they run around the house trying to kill each other - the same old man, the same.
