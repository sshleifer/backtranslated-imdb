Someone owes an apology to Ang Lee. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I've never been interested in the Ang Lee movie, Hulk, because of the almost unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels rarely showed this. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on the US network and, wow .... <br /> <br /> SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE AMAZING HULK <br /> <br /> It was annoying! I could barely get through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was unimpressive, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was nasty (and that's not fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descriptive face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it became clear that Ang Lee Hulk should resemble Bruce Banner frontally in his non-irritated state. When Hulk fought with a mutant poodle, I was ready to admit Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever. <br /> <br /> But then something happened. About 3/4 of the tedious film, there was a truly exciting, and - dare I say - reasonably convincing, action scene that starts with the Hulk coming out of a containment chamber at a military base, battling M1 and Comanche tanks. helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was very good. This is not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But that did not require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in many non-superhero action movies. And that is a great feat. <br /> <br /> Of course the finale got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into a kind of villain who changes shape, but the long sequence of previous action shamed any of Iron Man's heroes . . And overall, in addition to the mutant animated dogs, it actually looked like the CGI in Hulk tried to convince him that he was real and actually interacted with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected. <br /> <br /> OK, but what about the Incredible Hulk? Guess what ... It sucks too! There are only a few Hulk appearances and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version seemed fake at times and caricatured in others - but it also had its compelling moments. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had a skin tone and muscle tone that did not even look like a living creature, just a kind of computer generated texture. It was really absurd. The lighting, the mood, and the facial effects did not look like 5 years younger than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there's really no excuse for that. We really are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie as completely as any director, actor or filmmaker ever could. Worse, the screenwriter and director of this film seemed to learn almost nothing at all. "Fail" by Ang Lee. All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is virtually emotionless. The general is so inexorably implausible and unidimensional that he seems pretending than the Hulk. Love interest is not convincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are pretty easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson acts almost as much as Nick Nolte, despite being only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really does not do much in this movie, certainly no more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was a little faster, but since nothing really happened anyway, it's not worth much. Oh yes, the villain is as fake as the Hulk. He's actually a lot more interesting as a human than a monster. <br /> <br /> This is how I can definitely say that Ang Lee's version was better: if I had the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to see the good action sequences, or more to try to enjoy the dialogue a bit more (more likely I would just advance to the good parts). But there's absolutely no scene in The Incredible Hulk worth seeing once, let alone twice. It's really at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. Caricature CGI is an insult to the public - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course). <br /> <br /> It is absolutely incomprehensible how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by doing almost exactly the same film. <br /> <br /> It's to Edward Norton's credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this movie.
