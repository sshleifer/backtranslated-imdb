Although properly warned, I actually sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give each movie a break, and because I thought a single movie could not be that bad. I'm corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once, during that mood, a helpless parody I laughed. That is, during the Simon says scene. The other jokes are poorly executed or just plain bland. And some of them you actually see coming a mile away. This movie just does not have what it takes to be a good parody like the plane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny jokes, B. good dialogue and the most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men in white have D. none of the above. Calling this bad movie would be a crude euphemism. AVOID THIS ANYWAY MOVIE YOU CAN! BE ADVISED!
