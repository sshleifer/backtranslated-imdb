After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more credible and well-represented than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviewers have mentioned that as well, namely, what exactly is the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon's character? Has he raped other victims before? Is he completely psychotic or a "common" sociopath? How did he expect to flee with his attack on his younger sister? Is this character credible or is it just a matter of deeper being needed? He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortable and crazy character to be able to hold a teaching job that puts him in touch with young and vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint from the viewers in general. It has nothing to do with your performance, which is terribly convincing. The film occupies an uncomfortable position between pure exploration and a half way through serious treatment of the subject, without accommodating itself in any of the modes. Not the worst movie of all time, but not so good.
