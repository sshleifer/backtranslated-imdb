There are exactly two good things to be said about "Fantasies" (both mentioned by a previous critic as well): a) The extraordinary and inspiring beauty of Bo Derek's poetry. She's got shots in this movie, where she gives Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a big compliment, in fact. Her nakedness is brief and discreet, but just look at her face. <br /> <br /> b) The scenery of the Greek island, with its sun and clear blue waters. <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is abysmal and sometimes unintentionally funny ("He touched you where you are a woman!"), and the character of Peter Hooten is a viscous idiot . Bo overplays the naivety of her character, but again, when you have to work with the dialogue this bad is unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name "Damir" in almost every sentence is a great irritation) . Oh, and although the film is on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from children to old people, speaks English all the time. (*)
