Terrible, horrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> A condescending comment at the beginning and some nasty autopsy photos do not make a good movie. Once again I am impressed with the determination and skill that some people have in getting a film production and yet they are not proud to realize that what they have done is a lot of crap. <br /> <br /> I sat down and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that I could at least balance my criticisms, but the only one I could think of was that Pink's opening track was very good ... I I wonder if she saw it? <br /> <br /> Look at this at your own risk, boredom can kill you.
