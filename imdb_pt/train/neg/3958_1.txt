I'm not going to waste a lot of time on this one because, as far as I'm concerned, it's not really a movie to start with, just a careless mishmash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateur new images made exclusively for the film. purpose to stick the whole mess and call her "Boogeyman." Literally 80% of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor "The Boogeyman," a film the writers of this garbage apparently did not bother to watch because they could not even get the name of the original character of the actress Suzanna Love (Lacy ). right. And to add insult to injury, the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I wanted the IMDb rating system to be so low, the most insensitive and flagrant attempt to rip the money from the people I saw, YOU WERE ADMITTED!
