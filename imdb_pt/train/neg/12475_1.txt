I do not remember leaving a movie theater, except this time. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. An uninteresting plot, characters made of clay, violence with no point. I did not care when the good guys died; I did not care when the bad guys got it. Fantasy and magic were put like liver pudding and there was no coherence. In short, well entertaining if you spend an eternity in hell.
