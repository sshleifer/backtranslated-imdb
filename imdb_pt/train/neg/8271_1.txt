"Pretty Guys With Bad Haircuts !!" "Beautiful girls without any clue !!" "Stupid gangsters who can not shoot straight !!" From Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama, "Dragon Heat." For reasons that are likely to remain forever obscured, the production and casting of this movie "criminals-in-steroids" somehow managed to get both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to portray themselves as villains. But they do not have much to do in this horrible snail festival. <br /> <br /> They are two of the best contemporary actors, each with their own curriculum and a list of accomplishments, and Biehn in particular has had the courage to take on quite challenging and non-heroic roles. Maggie Q was the super-bad "Mai" in "Live Free Or Die Hard," Nuff said. Biehn is, of course, famous for being the soldier of the future who made The Terminator, 1984, a science fiction / fantasy joke, when he collided with Big Arnold. now the governor of California !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost totally wasted in this terrible disaster of a police drama. There is absolutely no reason for this, since the incredibly complicated plot - given mainly in Chinese, as is a Hong Kong story - could have been better crafted for non-Chinese audiences with a foreign narrator. In other words, if Biehn had been used as something as an observer or coordinator of Interpol, or an undercover agent, who needs to get some 'splaining' given to him every five or ten minutes, this would be great. But no, he is brought as part of a strange group of thugs of the special forces type who seem to be hiring their own corrupt agreement in the middle of the totally corrupt agreement of another person involving the local king of corrupt agreements. <br /> <br /> Yes, I said it all. Confused? Me too. "Welcome to the party, comrade." <br /> <br /> In Hong Kong's truly amazing crime drama, known by its title in English as "Breaking News", there are also a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot. <br /> <br /> Bad men against good cops. In this miserable and excessively violent incursion into the world of a Hong Kong triad or gang, it seems the hottest police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery, just as criminals knock them down. <br /> <br /> So, not surprisingly, there is an almost incomprehensible scene (several scenes, actually) where kids are trying to shoot wood ducks in an arcade game, to win rewards from stuffed animals. And so, good-looking, good-looking cops naturally intervene in their favor, so the gun owner has to give up Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also a hesitant attempt to create a "love". interest 'between one of the' visiting police 'and the only female' visiting policeman '. Visiting police officers are expected to be important witnesses against the triad gangster leader who is abducted on the way to his appearance in court , but not by his own team, but by the mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q and a few others.) All these killers want something, but we can not learn about what it is until the end of the movie !! of general history. <br /> <br /> You can not create suspense in a criminal drama without something to get, or get, or run away, being introduced too early in history. <br /> Add to this some " cut scenes "made for purely artistic purposes, all showing the recent past of bandits and bandits, and any movie fan can easily understand why this barking dog gets a rating of 1 this fan of all things cinematic with criminal s and conspirators and Hong Kong.
