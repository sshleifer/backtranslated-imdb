OK, this movie was made for a reason and a reason just to make money !! The producers obviously did not mind killing a classic horror movie. I knew this movie would be horrible as soon as it was pg-13 how many slg-13 pg-13 movies proved to be good? This is like asking how many women were on the moon? The answer is NOTHING !! The night of the 1980 ball did not have any masterpiece, but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a film that stays true to its genre and does not try to be anything beyond that. <br /> <br /> My problem with graduation night 2008 is the way he handles the killer and I have 3 big problems with him ................ ..... 1) The way he escapes, he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through an air conditioning outlet !! WHAT THE HELL? why would they have air conditioning ventilation in the patient room? Do they want you to be comfortable during your stay or something? 2) His intentions are a little uncertain the killer wants all the main family victims and dead friends so he can have it all to himself, he says he loves her, but the next minute he tries to kill her, so he do you want to kill her, love her or just rape her? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his skills? He used to be a teacher, so in that scene he kills the boyfriend of the main victim while he's basically over his sleep and she does not realize, it's all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible, silly and stupid attempt at a horror movie
