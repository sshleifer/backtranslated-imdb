This film is still a big step down from typical Bollywood cuisine. The performances were horrible. Even Boman Irani, who always manages to shine, is completely OTT as the villain. The soundtrack is also not memorable. And despite the effort, the female leaders can not be sexy. Vivek Oberoi is capable of much better projects, while Fardeen Khan seems to be stuck at a similar rate for now. But this monstrosity is even below his limited capabilities as an actor. Esha Deol and Amrita Rao are horrible in poorly written clich√© roles. It is time for Indra Kumar to hang the steering hat. I hope he never directs another monstrosity like that. Future Hindi movies are in better hands now. In short, stay away from the waste of celluloid.
