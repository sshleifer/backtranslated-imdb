This is not a boring movie, the audience can stay in his chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, filmmaker and actor here. The plot is simple: after a divorce and ten years of a non-Hollywood career, the author plays in search of love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all this: what is written, what came by chance? Both answers, "yes" or "no," portray M. Berkowitz as a low-average human being. If you are looking for a self-fiction about love like this, I recommend you read a few independent comics: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I was very disappointed to hear so much against my country, France. I know that American people often say that the French are arrogant (this may be true), etc., and certainly the French (and the whole world) have many sorrows against America, but why do they hate it so much? Do not think I could not like this movie just because of it.
