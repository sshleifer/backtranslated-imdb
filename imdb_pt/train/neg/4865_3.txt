I just did not like this movie. But then I loved Babe, a Pig in the City and were spoiled by animal movies that are exceptionally well done in every way. The animals were not pleasant. They were all annoying, especially Chris Rock guinea pig, but what I would expect, is Chris Rock. I believe he smiles once or twice at some cute lines, but that's it.
