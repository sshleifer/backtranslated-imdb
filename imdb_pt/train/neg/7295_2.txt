First of all, the reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone gets 10 stars for trying to salvage this totally useless attempt to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, I was all excited to read the commentary on a poster that Andrew Stevens in this film gave "the performance of his career." For me, it was Stevens' bad performance that completely ruined this movie, so I was all set to throw all kinds of insults at the person who made the above comment. So I thought to myself, what else did Stevens do? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbus movie was made, apparently all 33 projects Stevens has been in since then has been crap, so it's doubtful anyone has seen the rest of his career. <br /> <If you like Columbus, watch all the other 69 titles before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.
