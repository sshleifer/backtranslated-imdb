My kids watch the show every day they're on. It's a great program for small children. However, they need to stop showing the reruns and do some more shows and get rid of YELLOW TEETH from Rooney and Deedee. Moe is the only Doodle bop with clean white pear teeth and the kids notice these things and ask if they never brush their teeth? The show has already arrived in the United States and, if so, where can we find its programming on. And one more thing, if we can add. Moe, you need to stop hiding so much. Sometimes when you get out of a place where the younger kids are scared and the pulls the rope? What does that mean? other then get wet all the time. They need to add new stuff to the show instead of the same ole. Children lose interest that way.
