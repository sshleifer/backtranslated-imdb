Wonderful actors. <br /> <br /> Lousy script and not too great direction too. My main problem was that I just do not care about any of these people. Not the killer, not the victims. The settings were pretty monotonous. Dennis Quaid's character was so poorly written that I did not even care when the end came. He got his son back. Great deal! I wanted my money back.
