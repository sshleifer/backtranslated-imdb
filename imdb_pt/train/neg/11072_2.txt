I saw it on TV last night. Yes, I can hear what you say about it. It is likely to be categorized as one of those typical stereo TV soaps. In all honesty, the plot has a good idea, and you can agree by saying, "Well, that's not what I expected." But as a film, well, it is not easy to identify a redemptive element. Casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there's nothing to compliment. Rated R ?? Oh, this scene. We need this? This is a movie that you can watch and then forget that you watched. And what was the title again?
