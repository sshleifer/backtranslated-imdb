This film is another on the long budget line, effortlessly, without talent films recorded on video and with cover to fool unsuspecting renters. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what watching this movie is like, get a video camera and some tincture of red food and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and "attacking " people. Congratulations, you just made "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now see if a distribution company will buy from you. <br /> <br /> I saw a low budget, filmed in films that showed the talents of the filmmakers and actors or at least effort, but that does not have it. Avoid unless you are a true masochist or have fun with badly made horror films.
