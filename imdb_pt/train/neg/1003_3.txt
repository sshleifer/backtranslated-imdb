Okay, I'm not Japanese. I know a little about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Besides, I'm Spanish, like paella and I like black humor. Well, with that set point, I can comment on the film: I have no idea how nice the Japanese audience, Mamoru Oshii is a good director - despite postmodern things overly pedantic in the style of Talking Head, and even that was curious and in some interesting way - and I'm surprised he invented it. It may be just one of those lost translation cases, I fear, but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext subtitles overloaded in English, I thought it was horrible. The jokes looked bad, the script was overcooked - I mean, give the audience a break and shut their fucking narrator a little - almost to make my head explode with an exaggeration of quick conversations and absurd deeds. <br /> However, I found the animation was pretty cool. The idea is great and is well explored in these animated scenes. However, the sweet eye ends as soon as the characters are left out to begin with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech about still images. This only makes you want to move quickly to the next scene of cut-out hysterical characters. <br /> <br /> I read that Mamoru Oshii is actually planning a sequel to this. The idea was good but terribly exploited. Maybe the second part brings the good parts of this first one and really makes an interesting movie, or maybe it's more and more narrated scenes. But hell, if you thought the Talking Head was dense, Amazing Lifes from the Fast Food Gifters will cause you a stroke. <br /> <br /> Of course, all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European. Probably this is totally useless to the Japanese people, maybe it was a really funny movie lost in cultural borders and translation. Perhaps.
