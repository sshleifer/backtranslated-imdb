Gadar is an example of one of the most overrated films of Bollywood of all time. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make films related to the period, gives a film of trash. The songs were boring and not the kind of music you want to hear in your car, full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies, where he hits some 100 thugs on his own. He even kicks a metal (Indian) prison door and kicks a moving car away (Teesri Aankh). I can give you another 50 examples of shameless action from the Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know that. Sunny gives a pathetic performance, again repeating the same type of paper. A guy claiming to be fighting for his part, using violence. Amisha Patel is very sexy with an incredible body that I would love to bone. But even she could not save the movie from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does, in this movie she does not. Maybe because she was playing a Muslim, but she does not act like one in the movie. Overall, this is a bad show, I'm sure it will please some people, who love watching the Bollywood actor defeat 100 guys. Give me some time.
