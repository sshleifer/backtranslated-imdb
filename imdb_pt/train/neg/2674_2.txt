Someone had a great idea: Let's make Misty Mundae make her own version of Lara Croft - firing two guns, not only in tiny but also topless clothes. It was a really good idea. The problem is that the people who owned it could not come up with any type of road map or budget to support it. So we get a "movie" that hardly achieves the average duration by reproducing many of its parts (usually in slow motion), and was apparently filmed entirely inside a garage. The appeal of Misty Mundae is still evident: she is incredibly cute and has a natural beauty of girl next door. However, her two co-stars here, with whom she shares a long lesbian scene, are nowhere near her league. If "Mummy Raider" was presented as a Youtube video, I would rate it higher, but as a "movie" intended for DVD consumption, it can not get more than 1/2 a * of 4.
