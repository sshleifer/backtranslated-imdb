The plot is about a female nurse named Anna, caught in the midst of a worldwide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin to rise and dominate the world and attack the living. She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far, so good! I usually like horror movies, but this movie does not deserve to be called horror. It's neither exciting, just ridiculous. Even the "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunks not being able to get into a mall for more liquor. The heroes who locked themselves in the mall so that they would not be eaten by the bad guys out there are not any better. Even though they do not appear to be drunk, they appear to be mentally incapacitated. Save your money instead of spending it on it!
