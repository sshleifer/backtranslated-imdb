A fragmentary film about some people in Austria during a heatwave. This type of film was made more often and, above all, the better. The stories really have nothing to do with each other, other than the pathetic ending: "people are cruel." Ugly meat, nasty people and a movie that lasts a long time without actually making a point ... Ultra-realistic? Hardly ... annoying? Indeed. Not even the beautiful Franzisca Weiss can save that! 3/10
