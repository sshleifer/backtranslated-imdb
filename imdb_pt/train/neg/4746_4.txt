There are several things wrong with this movie - the character of Brenda Song is one of them. I do not believe the girl is a lousy actor - I honestly do not believe it. I believe she is given poor lines. She should be, "that vain, rich girl," and although it's funny on the TV shows she plays, she can not even laugh at me here. <br /> <br /> I really should know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was not so terrible ... initially. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you around telling you to wear a locket and insisting you were needed to fight "the great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is entirely fiction, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" of Wendy's family lineage were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt the monks were okay with it. Of course, maybe they could have worked somehow, but they offered no explanation. In doing so, they have only contributed to the many extravagant attempts at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that, however, we will continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the movie continues. Yes, she's a teenager, and she's close to coming home-that is, who wants to fight evil while on the way home? The problem is that when "evil" begins to manifest, Wendy does not seem as terrified as she should. She is extremely careless even for someone like her. She still does not care about her training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, evil will prevail, and all good will vanish." Wendy: "Whoa, talk about pressure. Well ... let's talk about something else." Yeah, come on, Wendy. Let's also dance when you should be training properly. Of course Shen leaves her, but her character has an excuse. It's better that he cooperates with her, that he does not, and she does not train anything, and make them both dead. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way. Shen also told Wendy that it was her fate to die for her in battle, as he did for her great-grandmother (I am assuming that part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable. As the screenwriter said, Wendy's return and this "great battle" are on exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you have to guess? Yes, she ends up going to battle, because when she tries to leave for the ball, the monks (who Shen had cornered in her coach's body and teachers because she "felt strange struggling with an old man") informed her that Shen was to battle alone, then she will save him. <br /> <br /> Initially, we see some fairly decent fighting, which is actually fun. Until finally, the great evil comes from the body of Wendy, rival for homecoming, and creates the actual embodiment of himself from the pieces of the bodies of his former warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy gets all "panicked." So Shen goes and defends her from this guy - forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name - and manages to get killed. <br /> <br /> Wendy catches Shen as he makes his long descent from being pushed uncomfortably high into the air. <br /> <br /> She shouts the title of the said article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful very, very fast. No, I will not let her be excused because it was her "destiny" and she had "the power within" her. Since when, however, has she learned the cure? No, worse ... since when could she resurrect people? Then Shen is resurrected from the dead. So, Wendy and he fight with the guy. <br /> <br /> He loses his way easily. The worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. So the monks recommend Wendy her sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: The writer and director do not know that a battle needs a little more finesse? # 2: What sacrifice? The fact that she did not go to the ball? Because the girl did not sweat or bleed. I mean, come on now, this movie was PG TV, I wanted to see someone get hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-ha ... moving on. <br /> <br /> I know it sounds like maybe I should have given the movie one based on my comments. Part of the criticism, you should know, however, is to break a thing. You do not necessarily try to look for evil, but if you are there, you draw attention to it. This movie has a lot of bad things, but something funny happens when you never expect something to be very good in the first place. <br /> <br /> So, I suppose everything was fine. Not that I was not saying it was not okay, it would have prevented anyone from watching it.
