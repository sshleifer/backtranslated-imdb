God, I was bored out of my head while watching this pilot. I was expecting a lot from that, since I am a big fan of James Cameron (and not just since "Titanic", I might add), and his name on the credits that I thought would be a guarantee of quality. , he also wrote the Leaden Strange Days ..). But the thing failed miserably in catching my attention at any moment of its nearly two-hour duration. All this time, he barely passed the two-line synopsis, and I would be hard-pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot of all the mess of wires that got nowhere. Also, I do not think the stunts have outperformed any regular "A-Team" episode. As for Alba, yes, she's beautiful, of course, but the fact that she shows only a single facial expression throughout the film (cranky and grouchy) makes me bored with her "gal wit a attitude" attitude soon. You can get me out of here, Mr. Cameron!
