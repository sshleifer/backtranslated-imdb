There is no way to describe how this movie is really, really, really bad. It's a shame that I really watched this movie, this very tiring and predictable movie. What's wrong with that? Performance: There is no performance that is remotely alike even though it is unsatisfactory (at least they are all very beautiful). Soundtrack (songs): "If we can get Orgy on the soundtrack, everyone will know they're watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (punctuation): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can make a soundtrack right nowadays. Do not even get me started on "what the heck?" Moments, here are some: Killer can move at the speed of light - the door opens Actress turns, no one is there, turns back, there is something sitting in front of her; Out of now, where the killer appears with an electric drill, a very large one! Filmmakers earn points to at least turn it on, but I can really believe that the killer has had time to find the outlet to power it. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grail and I mean "Where did you get the electric drill?" I could keep talking about how bad this movie is but I have only 1000 words. I'll give this 2 out of ten stars. One star for making me laugh and another star all over my neckline. Seriously, do not waste your time on this one.
