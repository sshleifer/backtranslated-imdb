I'm not saying this because the production values ​​were so low, but because they were filmed terribly. That picture of the girl washing her hair in the stream? Did we really need to sit there for a long shot and watch her do it for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, the lighting was just bad. You could barely see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course I have not jumped most of it, and I do not want to hear anyone say I need to watch the whole thing first to try it. This film has been so poorly executed and executed that even by the independent and low budget standards it is simply terrible. A horrible movie ... do not waste time, unless you want to have a good laugh, but still not because of the "funny" lines of the actors, it's because of how painfully bad production is.
