The movie is very funny and involves about four dates, so it becomes a blatant commercial for a guy you (and even your "friends") really do not support. It is a very interesting concept; film date on a quest to find true love in modern LA. The problem is that he feels incredibly (and badly) scripted sometimes and ostensibly self-promoting. It's hard to care and be drawn to any of the characters because the writer / actor is so selfish, uncool, fake and just plain nasty. You end up feeling sorry for his encounters.
