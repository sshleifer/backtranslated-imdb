This is a movie that makes you say two things ... 1) I can do much better than this (acting, writing and directing) 2) this is so bad that I should leave a review and warn others ... < It looks like it was filmed with my flip video. I also believe that my friend who told me to watch this has a revenge against me. I have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; It must have been left by staff members or people with something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. I hope the writers and the director leave the business. not even talented enough to do commercials !!!!!
