Imagine the scenery - you're at the movies just because you're in Washington over the weekend and it's raining and finished with the museums. You think you can go see the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer looks so and you do not have to wrap your brain around. Is it sold out. Options? - The bank's work in Bruges, The Leatherheads or prom night. You've seen Bank Job (surprisingly decent assault movie) and In Bruges (again, very good) so you're up to two. You do not like to see Clooney or the office guy running around in 1930's football uniforms, so you'll see Prom Night, right? Wrong. You get the $ 8.50, go to a stranger on the street and ask him to punch his face for $ 8.50. It would be money better spent. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's more of a comedy than a terror / suspense or whatever. If I financed this film and they showed me that, as a final cut, I would not know if I laughed or cried. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence ... my roommate was laughing loudly about the acting, they might have robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. The detective has to be possibly the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his interpretation so much that I do not care how you spell his name) that you're relieved with his title (s) <br /> <br /> So in summary 'not good'
