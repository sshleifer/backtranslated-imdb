Jeff Lowell wrote and directed 'Over Her Dead Body' badly. The idea is first of all, it's as old as my jokes and execution is just a cherry on the cake. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker, there is nothing appealing in this movie. Eva is great as always and offers a nice performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd seems tired and less interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. She looks manly and offers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, just like Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I expected more entertainment with this movie. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy myself.
