I think the biggest flaw that something can have is being boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing does not have the breath. It has the interesting fact of occurring in Cambodia. How many American films from the 1930's were made in Cambodia. However, the conflict is a bit hard to figure out. Even the movements of the troops are a bit confusing. What drags us to a resounding stop is the love story. Why these two guys are so completely fixed on the blonde I do not know. I thought he should continue to use his zombies (as they are) and forget all about it. The movie just goes on. The perfect microcosm is where one of the main characters follows a Cambodian priest across the water to reach the secret place where hieroglyphs (or any other) that explain how to turn people into zombies are kept. I thought they would never get there. A guy takes two steps. It stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. It stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is bad acting and insipid dialogue. I really have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This is unbearable. By the way, a more appropriate title would be Hypnotized Uprising.
