It was Jon Pertwee who said "It's so hard to be funny, but it's so easy to be silly." Well, if that's the case PASTY FACES is "very easy". David Baker (as director / writer) and his cast seem to be under the impression that the comedy involves stealing scenes and style from top britcoms like LOCK STOCK and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down talking a lot fast loud voice. Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this kind of OTT performance, but not enough to ruin the film because there is not enough film to spoil. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially in the sense of script. I could not understand why it ended the way it happened, it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly way. Oh, and other glaring mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the US and a green card to work there - that movie would make you believe that you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without authorization - that you are still paid to donate blood in America - People I know in America, who donate blood, tell me that donation payments stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any kind of weapon from a gun store. As far as I know the gun laws in America differ from state to state, but no gun store sells anti-tank weapons over the counter. So we have a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal movie and oh so bland. Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very hollywoodian view of the Scots? Maybe, but that does not stop PASTY FACES from being a comedy.
