I stopped five minutes when Beowulf received an automatic two-shot beast. Not only the beasts do not have telescopic sights, but Beowulf defeated Grendel in close combat. The terrible acting of wood and the eternal darkness that haunts all the original science fiction films did not help either. Having just arrived a few minutes before feeling my bile rise and decided to watch I Love Lucy reruns instead, this is really about all I have to say. But, you may very well just realize that it's a made-for-TV movie and ignore it right there. <br /> <br /> A farce.
