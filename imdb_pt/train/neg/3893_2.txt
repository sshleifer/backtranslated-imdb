I was thinking that the main character, the astronaut with the bad race case (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) could always have more work in the movies after being reduced to a puddle. All he has to do is get a job like Blob. The premise of this movie is very bad. An astronaut is exposed to solar radiation (I think), and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day. Not only is this a puzzle, but apparently he has to kill humans and consume his flesh so he can maintain some kind of cellular integrity. There is? Have you noticed that whenever some kind of radiation accident or experiment happens, the person instantly turns into a killing machine? Why does it happen? <br /> <br /> The astronaut enters the night from the "secret facility" (which has no security), leaving parts of himself as he goes. Apparently he holds only enough memory to get him to the launch pad, maybe because he wanted to go back into space. <br /> <br /> So begins the part of the movie that is quite filling, with a doctor wandering with a Geiger counter, trying to find the man melting by the buzz he gives. He kills a stupid fisherman resembling Bill Gates, scares a little girl to la Frankenstein, and ends up with an older, crazy couple (punishing them karmically for stealing a few lemons). Then there is a short scene in which he beats his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young potboy and chases his girlfriend around. You'd think that after she cut off his arm and he fled, the scene would change. But no ... we are treated with about ten minutes of the woman huddled in a breathless corner and screaming in terror, even if the monster has disappeared. All I could think about was ... the director's girlfriend, anyone? <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is even worse than the rest. The melting man ends up turning into a pile of goo, and then ... nothing. That's it. This is the end of the movie. Well, at least that meant there was no room for a continuation.
