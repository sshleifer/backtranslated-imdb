This was a better-than-average movie, I thought, being on cable. I expected something of the tacky melodrama type and bad special effects seen in classics like Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> The cast was well chosen ... especially liked Ron Livingston as the SWAT commander pressed. It's good to see him revisiting the same stuff he was so lucky with Band of Brothers. The producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and scenes seemed to have been made that day in 1997. So if you get the chance to see this movie, I'm sure you goes from FX reexecutions all 50 times ... take 2 hours and have fun.
