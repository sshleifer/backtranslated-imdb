About the worst movie in distribution right now! I love zombie movies and I saw this in the used rack, so I thought why not? Oh my god a shame for zombie movies and fans for the genre! Whoever made this movie needs to save their camcorder and go to film school! There are so many injured dogs out there who have invested time and effort in their films and have something that this film has no dignity. I know what it takes to make movies and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent doing the Meat Market, but none of that money and time went to making it good. You need actors, a script, a real camera, to invest in some books on how to make independent films. I do not know how you got a DVD release, but whoever did this is a good friend or banging his head on the wall. In blood films is quality and not quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that this is really in the stores and that I could not get my money back. Please, if you saw this movie, write here and put an end to shlock. I know I'm being too harsh, I only had 10 lines, so I'm trying to get to the point.
