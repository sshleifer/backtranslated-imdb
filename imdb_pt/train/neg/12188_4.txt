Although I can not deny that his films are fun, I've always felt personally that Martin Scorsese is a bit overrated in his abilities. His use of flashy styling in most of his films seems to scream, "Look at me, am I not an imaginative director?" His best film I've seen is the one with the least flourishing, the superlative "Bull Raging". <br /> <br /> For this remake, it looks like everything was normal, though. The stock of bland movies to convey a 1950s scenario was so insipid to the point of being a distraction in itself. Melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic "Psycho" are more likely to provoke grinning smiles than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score for "Psycho" was incredibly annoying, this "homage" sounds strident and annoying. Even the cast, which can sometimes be decent, makes theatrical performances that just scream "caricature"; the notable exception to this being a clever twist of Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The worst offender here is surprisingly De Niro. Of course, it looks adequately menacing, but as soon as it opens its mouth, the aura vanishes. Now I'm no expert in American accents, I originally came from close to Manchester in England, and all but surely he could have a more convincing Southern accent than that? Being the talented physical actor he is, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not quite. It was disconcerting to me, as a De Niro fan, to be wishing he were off-screen, rather than be ecstatic with his performance. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SHEETS.) <br /> <br /> -The top style of the entire film extends to the ridiculously exaggerated end. When will Scorsese learn that underestimating the situation can sometimes create tension as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and audible bombardment? I also thought he was a very respected reputation for resorting to the cheap "murderer-not-dead-yet" trick that less talented individuals could employ. <br /> <br /> In all, a completely ridiculous 'thriller'. Scorsese and De Niro did MUCH better work together.
