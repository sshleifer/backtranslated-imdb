This was a waste of time. Danger: If you watch, you will be tempted to tear your DVD from the wall and push it through the window. <br /> <br /> An amateur production: a terrible, repetitive and empty dialogue; fine paper webbing; wood performances; Lucy Lawless was pathetically banal. <br /> <br /> History seriously flawed, characters completely unbelievable. The two worst concepts in film and t.v. are: (1) the twin of evil, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> The plot "twist"? Outrageously simplistic and obvious - like watching a train coming down the lane in the middle of the day on the prairies. It does not even resolve correctly. Evil is not punished for the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please, please - do not watch this, even if it's free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue.
