I found Darkness to be very dark. It had some kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and some fun times to get you out of UGH! BUT, it was underlit to the point of confusion. You do not really know what's always going on in the dark scenes and for a movie that's shot in Super 8 Film, you already have all that nasty grain to deal with. Just like in Nathan Schiff's movies, it's awesome. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he does not have the know-how to do it. The camera is never pointed in the right place, the lack of fundamentals like how to shoot scenes of simple dialogues and how to light a movie also hurts. The actors are all quite unequal and tough. But despite these negatives, the music is good, the gore is a lot and ranges from silly putty to very good gadgets. Is this a classic as it is called? Is it worthy of the two discs worthy of praise? DO NOT. But it's a good first try. Now, if these guys stop patting you on this movie (from what I understand here, the one they've already finished) for a while and try again, they can do better.
