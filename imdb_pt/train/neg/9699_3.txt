Despite what many other people thought about the first movie, I really enjoyed it. This however. How to sum up in one word?: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's see part by part: Here's the plot: Finally the old queen has been removed from his castle, but his successor: Snow White has other types of problems: The Court-Jester, father of his son, has deviated, like the super, Spliss, goes to the extreme, to fight with his gray hair and sells the real offspring of some blond hair and full. In his desperation, Snow White seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first find his other six dwarven companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend where the writers were very drunk but were under pressure from the studio to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it is not worth buying the DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least saves the film from complete forgetfulness is the performances of some of the actors. That's why I gave the 3/10 move. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at one point, they even go through our reality, and unfortunately .. they do not do anything funny being here. <br /> <br /> Still, many great actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Hagen Nina, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (Especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as the mirror, Helge Schneider and many more, but unfortunately, all these comedians are not capable of giving life to this really bad script. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a treat for some hardcore fans, but for regular movie goers or even for DVD renters or buyers, it's not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I even regret renting the movie.
