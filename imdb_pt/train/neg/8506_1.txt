This may actually be the worst movie I've ever seen on the scene. Inconsistent would be a compliment. It did not make sense to the end, but it was a tremendous relief that it was finally over. I watched with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and it did. At the end of this mess, I regret that any of the characters survived and I was not feeling very charitable about the actors either. If you want to watch a train accident, I recommend leaving at a train station. Even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess. Apparently I did not unburden myself enough to fill my ten prescribed lines, so, at the risk of redundancy, I'll say it one more time. This movie is a zero and would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. How about minus zero?
