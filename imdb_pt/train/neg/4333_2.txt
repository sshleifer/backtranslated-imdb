Quote: teurgista: Anyone with an I.Q. more than 50 would have seen this movie as it is, a smart prequel and well represented in a modern classic, yes, it does not have a highly successful cast or a huge budget, but it is still very well done and addicted me for the whole duration . One IQ over 50 you say .. what else means that you have an IQ less than 50 .. his name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! which means you should have something with the first one to do .. <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone an OK movie if .. YOU CHANGE THE TITLE AND NO CHARACTERS CALLED CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps do not comment on a movie if you do not know anything about movies. but I think an I.Q. under 50, you will not know what the hell I'm screaming ... <br /> <br /> Peace out !!
