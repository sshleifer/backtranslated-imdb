A young American woman visits her Irish roots and dodges a druid witch who owns her. It sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start, I got lost and spent most of my time wondering where I was going. The film seems to be hesitant in two directions - are we watching the penchant of the Irish-American woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a horror movie about an evil witch returning from the past? The director can not decide. The two do not look like gel and in the end you get nowhere. This could be much better done and the story seemed to drag on until the end. This was very annoying and disappointing.
