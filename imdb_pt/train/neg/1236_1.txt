What happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he did the kind of typical summer action that could have been directed by anyone available at film school ... and, in fact, they probably would have done a better job. They would have at least put half the thought into the terrible writing. <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who has traveled through some kind of wormhole and landed on a planet ruled by monkeys. Except that this time the monkeys will squirm through dialogue worthy of moaning, nonsensical plotting, and flashy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could have been put into about 10 independent films that would have been considered. The masterpiece 'next to this gut. <br /> <br /> As much as I appreciate the excellent acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as the evil ape leader, Thade, is nothing more than an intense composition of heavy and sloppy breathing. Luckily for him, the makeup allows him as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles. <br /> <br /> And unfortunately, the ever-reliable Hollywood tradition of leading the man and woman leads and connects them in the end without any relationship or cause development. And the "haha, we're so smart, are not we?" way Hollywood blends references from the original POTA to this. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this, spend the night here and call some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands',' Batman ', or even a little less' Sleepy Hollow, and reminiscent of the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... not shameful and ridiculous.
