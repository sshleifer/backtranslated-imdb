Strange horror movie from producer Charles Band. On the days of Full Moon's biggest hit, Band said he would never make "real movies" because he thought little puppets and big monsters added an element of fantasy that made movies better - people who killed themselves were real and less fun . A good philosophy and a real shame that the band, having destroyed the Full Moon studio through shoddy deals, became so desperate for home theater profits that it started to do exactly what Blockbuster wanted, and therefore , sacrificed creativity and originality. The staff behind this also worked on 'Delta Delta Die!' and 'Birth Rite' - both equally soft by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is at her best as a newcomer to a gang of boys and girls who decide to come up with a story about a "murder club." She - as would be obvious - does all she can to join in and then panic because it was not a true story and the idiot of Miss. Rochon believed that and now everyone would have to be covered in blood and maybe kill each other or maybe not. The choice is that there is and in regards to this movie, its ... not recommended, but also not totally bad.
