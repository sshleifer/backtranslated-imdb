Horrible! Absolutely awful! No plot, no point, no end. It looks like the director turned on the camera and then the whole crew went to lunch. Everyday. I'm trying to give this video but no one will accept it. I am giving a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger, I'll have to say otherwise. <br /> <br />
