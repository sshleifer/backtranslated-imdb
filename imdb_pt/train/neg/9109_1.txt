The First Cruel Intentions, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how could they do such a bad follow up? Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first film. In this, Amy Adams sucks. She's terrible. And they could not have found a girl who really looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean, come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he's absolutely terrible when compared to Ryan Phillipe. Sebastian in the first film is dishonest, misleading and much more evil than Sebastian in the prequel. And what about the plot? Basically it's like this ... <br /> <br /> 1- Sebastian has a bad rep in his first school, so the movie says, although he does not mention anything about him and his love life, and how he's been with girls 2 - Sebastian moves to New York, and suddenly decides that he will turn around. He "falls in love" with Danielle (I might remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle Giller says the quote "You broke up with the FIRST PERSON you ever loved because I said ... so how could he have fallen in love with the prequel? "And he's all nice and charming, and every" good person, "as he rejects the sex of the girl his father was doing. 3. He makes a total of 180 and ends in a threesome at the end of the movie, and then seduce Cherry. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's terrible And I loved the first one so much I still did not even see the third.I hope god is better than this prequel.
