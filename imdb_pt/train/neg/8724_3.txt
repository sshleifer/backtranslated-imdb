OK - the cons first: The mandatory 70's alligator (right, alligator) with non-moving limbs becomes the worst for miniature underwater shots (with the full extent of the reptile compared to the size of the boat) using a toy alligator being wheeled around the toy boat in well lit water - even for night shots! <br /> <br /> Unlike most primitive films that kill Western explorers, superstitious natives clap their hands and start massacring tourists. unjustified this time. No one really abused the natives - exploited, yes, but far from abusive treatment. After all, it was one of the natives (fiddling with a spoiled supermodel during a full taboo moon) that brought the River Demon curse on them, right? <br /> <br /> Vacationers are easily irritating (with the notable exception of the old symbolic soul / little-girl-blasphemy-who-takes-a-hero-shine you often see in Euroflicks' 70s), but far from deserving violent death - unless they were their next door neighbors, remember. A couple is actually dead being heroic - notable for none of them filling the role of helper. There are only two villains straight across the film, so the disappearances seem more arbitrary than cathartic. <br /> <br /> The sequence in which the gigantic alligator crouches and arrests thirty tourists in less than five minutes is likely to hit him involuntarily. <br /> <br /> The point where the natives decide not to clean up surviving westerners and practically say "hey, you're not too bad, after all, I'm sorry for that mess last night" - because they blew up the monster lizard - you're shaking your head while the cheesy music kicks in. You know, the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village because of the tourist trade after the credits roll ... <br /> <br /> The Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You know why you're interested in this movie in the first place, right? I thought that way. If you are a Bach complician, get the DVD reissued by the NoShame movies earlier this year (digitally remastered with no real addition, in addition to the director mourning the current state of international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not at all bad, he is far from being an idiot (always a plus in B movies) and the cynical little boy provides most of the comic relief. <br /> <br /> Take a look, but buy cheaper!
