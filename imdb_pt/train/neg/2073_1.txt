Oh my God. Oh my God, I can not get over this movie. It was horrible. horrible terrible! Do not even waste your money to buy it in the 99-cent deposit. No, avoid at all costs. I'm warning you! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? Are you kidding me. Be real it sounds like some kind of new Barbie doll .. Super women? Are you kidding me. It was so fake. The townspeople did not seem to care that there was a blonde flying around just hanging around town saving a fire ... Oh, great! <br /> <br /> Jesus, was it just me or did I? movie looks offensive? I think what you need to be a superhero is a pair of double D's, fluttering blond hair, no glasses and a tight leather suit? <br /> <br /> If you were trying to be romantic ... .. god, I do not know. It was horrible, if loving means taking someone to an art show and having sex in a bed And in the air ... than they had totally love! <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything was too fast. First that guy was single, from what he was dating G-girl ... from what they ended up from what he dated that girl from Hannah ... and ... it just goes on. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie made me think .. How the hell did they get it in theaters? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
