And how this came to production surprises me. The main character is an unpleasant show that is not at all funny. I can not stand the character. He's an ass with nothing to offer the show. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon to come out in the last 10 years, no kidding. The story lines are poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as those of Sweet Life of Zack and Cody of Disney. I could not dislike this show anymore, it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title, even worse. <br /> <br /> It's as if this show was written by a couple of 15-year-olds who based the character on themselves and thought they were hot when in fact they were just arrogant and needy. creativity as well as humor. <br /> <br /> Test Johnny, go far and fast!
