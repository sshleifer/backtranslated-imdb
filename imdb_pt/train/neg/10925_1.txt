I'm at this very moment debating whether I should even finish watching this "poppycock" of a movie. They had a very interesting idea, with the set buried, and that was it. So far this incomprehensible mess has no real history. There's the buried set, some monster with a wolf-head running loose, an amulet and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the masked wolf whatever it is. What I would have forgotten, if I had had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a buggy chase, some really bad C.G.I, some incredibly stupid dialogue, plus C.G.I, and the hero fighting paper clippings. In addition to the original idea, this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. My mistake for continuing to watch. - MERK
