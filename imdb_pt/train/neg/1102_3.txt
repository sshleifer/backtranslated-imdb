Firstly, I must admit that both films I saw by this director saw no titles and so may have missed the points. My Czech is not bad, but having watched two of his films, I wish I had not tried to learn. Samotari is very cool. Very cool. There are about ten different story lines that come in and out together. This is not so unusual in a city the size of Prague (tiny, actually). The main characters are between 20 and 30 years old. They have jobs and only one studies. The best character is the young girl from the Balkans. Their feelings are echoed by immigrants here every day. That's about it. The only great character. Everyone is doing their own lives completely on their own. How can I sympathize with this obvious incompetence? Maybe there are interesting pieces with Japanese tourists, but I need another stereotype in the cinema? If you like music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at the stupidity of others, watch this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, see an original Jarmusch not an imitation. And under no circumstances see Ondricek's movie, Septej (Whisper.) That's unless you like homophobic stereotypes.
