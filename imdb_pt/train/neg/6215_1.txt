This really was a waste of time ... the film has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends abruptly with many loopholes ... although the animation is top notch. <br /> <br /> Once the film started, I tried to give the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting at a later stage, but it was never unique. This same plot was played several times, but what got worse was that the big hole in the plot was the whole story on how to kill the bad guys ... The writer could have done a lot more with the whole concept, but it seemed that he or she did not had his heart on it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> Overall, very hype, but not able to deliver.
