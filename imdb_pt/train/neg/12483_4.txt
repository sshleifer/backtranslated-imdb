This movie is like Conan, the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There's a plot somewhere beneath all this debauchery, but the filmmakers do not do a good job showing it, which is a shame because "it" could be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as well as the villain - which unfortunately did not appear in anything more noteworthy. The fight scenes are not bad either - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword "drink" the blood of its victims - and there is plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad ...
