I saw this movie twice through a Pentecostal church that my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was from the tender age of 6, my brother 4, then again when I was 8, my brother 6. This movie terrified my brother and me and shaped the way we viewed the world with suspicion. It was not just the film, but it was also the philosophy that encompasses so many "Christians" about the "mark of the beast" and the rapture. This film, the church and a volatile and careless education, lead to severe paranoia about the future. For years I have lived under the delirious effects of the church and the fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. He went through years of counseling. I once explained to a psychiatrist this film and the church and family belief system. I was tied to a delirious disturbance. I really began to believe it, it was my brother who reminded me, that this cultic philosophy really happened. I no longer fear the future, I have come to terms with the fear injected into its members by the church. I took this experience to fulfill a purpose, I am approaching my licensing as a Psychologist specializing in childhood traumas.
