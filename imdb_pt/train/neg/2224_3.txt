I saw this for the first time when I was about 7 years old. I remembered what I thought was a vague outline of what was happening. It turns out now, 15 years later, that I remembered everything with great precision, because it seems that writers never went beyond sketching the story. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no background story, no character arcs, nothing. Good guys do things because they're good, while bad guys do things just because they're bad. An unintentionally hilarious part is when someone you think is important dies and no one cares at all. They just shrug and move on. There is almost no dialogue as well. If you cut the fight scenes and the running scenes, you'll lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this because you want to see a good animation and for no other reason. Or if you like to look at cartoon chicks with little clothing (or with half-naked faces).
