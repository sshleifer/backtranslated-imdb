Twenty years ago, Michael Hawthorne, five, witnessed his father killing his mother with an ax on an empty road and committing suicide later. Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip) Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween in the country with their grandparents on their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that represent his greatest fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved Morty doll (Jon Fedele) that would eliminate their fears. forever. Michael's greatest fear is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty becomes his father, killing his friends. <br /> <br /> "Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and pointless blow. film that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the deepest fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy script full of clich√©s. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs. Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but in general the performance is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation why the mannequin is taken to live; In addition, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sadness when each of them dies. The slower pace over more than fifty minutes could have been used to build a better dramatic situation. In the end, Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed throughout history. I do not know if the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes of duration. The special effects are very reasonable for a B movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: A Halloween Night" ("Fear 2: A Halloween Night")
