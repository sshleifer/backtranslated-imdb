THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-Vista 3-D) <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> While searching for a (literally) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) picks up a gray hawker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies with a reputation for haunting the area. <br /> <br /> An absolute loss of time, impaired from the start by Haggerty's painfully amateur performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories that make up most of the running time are totally routine, compounded by indifferent performances and the lack of direction of Brad Sykes, previously responsible for artists like CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a 'fun' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's films are 'fun' (he at least believed what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts despite the lack of talent); Sykes's home movies are indeed aggravating, boring, and almost completely devoid of any redemptive virtue, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and deceived by this unimaginative and ill-conceived trash. The 3-D format is totally wasted here.
