If you are looking for a movie that portrays the meaningless and boring existence of middle-class lives caught up in a network of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the movie for you. If you too the film is involved and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that do this much better. For example, try some of Bergman's darkest movies. The filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he should subject the viewer to an agonizing and empty incident after another, until the film finally reached its tortuous and pathetic end. If you value your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours, like cleaning your house, for example.
