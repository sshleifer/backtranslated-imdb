A series of painfully dull skits that seem to last forever and one day. Not as frighteningly awful as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but that in no way is an endorsement in any way, sense or form. Presents the worst clown rhyme ever. More than that, if it is not offensive to anyone, but the most puritanical or politically correct. Also has the worst parody of music that EVER put in the film, the WORST representation of Arnold NEVER (not just the worst placed in the movie, literally the worst ever). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan, or Slash would star in this (the reasons I watched this in the first place) The only slightly fun thing was Dickman. In conclusion I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE, but the people who are doing their mission in life to get this in the Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable with you live people. Moreover, if it is true that the Church of Scientology hates you, it can not be ALL evil. My Note: D
