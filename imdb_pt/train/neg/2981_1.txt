This movie was recently released on DVD in the US and finally got a chance to see this gem hard to find. It even came with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics such as "SPASMO" and "BEYOND THE DARKNESS". Unfortunately, the previews were the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBIE 3" in a bizarre way is actually linked to the famous Lucio Fulci franchise "ZOMBIE" which began in 1979. Similarly compared to "ZOMBIE", "ZOMBI 3" consists of a draining plot and a handful of extremely bad actors who keep this garbage of terror almost floating. Blood is almost non-existent (unless someone is afraid of people running with green moss on their faces) and dubbing in English is a bit embarrassing. The plot this time involves some sort of secret military operation with a bunch of inept scientists (ie a dorky male and his stupid female side kick) who are developing some sort of chemical substance called "Death One" who supposedly re-animate the dead. Unless my ears need to be checked, I do not even remember a REASON for the "Death One" poll. It seems to exist only to wreak havoc on the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this film festival of laughter. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Death One" is tasted on a corpse I swear that look like Yul Brynner), and after he is injected into his system, he stands up and his head explodes! The sound effects are also quite hilarious - while the corpse's face bubbles with the green slime, the 'crumpled paper' sound can be heard. The "Death One" toxin is transported outward and is "hi-jacked" by a group of thieves, where it starts off with it, but it is infected after cutting into an exposed flask. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the guy turns into a zombie but not before making his escape in time to a cheap motel, infects a humble doorman and kills a maid pushing his face to the bathroom mirror (!). The military perceives this and immediately acts before "eliminating" everyone who has the misfortune of being inside the "contamination zone" and turning the motel upside down. They find the thief infected and burn their body, just so that the smoke infects a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney (!). <br /> <br /> We cut off the introduction of a group of men who are off duty by listening to groovy music that is coming out of a small boombox while wearing a trailer full of slutty girls who are leaning toward outside the windows and showing her breasts. Can anyone say "zombie food"? We also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car that stops to inspect a bunch of birds on the road ... the same birds that were infected by the 'zombie' smoke! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the boyfriend and the girl goes to an abandoned gas station to fetch water. This is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments in the movie. She walks through this old, rusty, obviously abandoned building, where she continues to ask out loud, "HELLO IS SOMEONE HERE? PLEASE, I NEED SOME TIME OF WATER!" She finds a group of zombies, one of which is attached to a wall (!) And the other is shaking a machete. After a bit of crashing and collapsing on the floor, she escapes, but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the birds attack the trailer of prostitutes and a girl is pecked and infected. They all arrive at the same motel where the original infection occurred, and that's where the second most hilarious moment of the movie happens. After a few hours (at most one day), the same motel is now covered in dust, has climbing vines and seems to have been abandoned for years. Anyway, what better place to take refuge than this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to crumble when several people go out together to get trapped in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman exploring a deserted village, from which the woman comments: "THIS PLACE IS A CLEANING!" She then starts to be pushed from a zombie into the pirahna infested water where she has her legs ripped out and turns into a zombie in seconds! Meanwhile, her friend back at the motel that was pecked and infected HOURS earlier is still turning into a zombie! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are many inconsistencies in this movie that make this movie very stupid for words. . For example, the time rate for infected people being 'buzzed' is very different. Sometimes it takes seconds, sometimes it takes hours. Some zombies run, others drag their feet and walk very slowly. Some even do kung-fu moves, while others lurk under piles of hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies do! The funniest moment is the infamous 'zombie head in the refrigerator' that 'rises' in the air and 'attacks' a stupid man looking for food. Incredibly, his girlfriend gets her throat ripped out by her headless part (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me was the lack of stories involving people who are in fact killed by zombies. We can never see them coming back as zombies, in fact the only ones we see 'buzzing' are the birds pecked and the only girl who gets her legs ripped out. Other than that, I was at least expecting the couple that was killed in the kitchen and / or the guy who was killed on the bridge would come back like zombies. It's also amazing that these zombies only take a few "bites" and then move on to the next victim. <br /> <br /> The most laughable moment was, of course, the zombie fetus. An infected pregnant woman is lying on a bed in a hospital. A woman who seems to have a lot of "medical knowledge" tries to deliver the baby (!) And has her face plucked by a zombie, before having her head pushed to the woman's stomach where a hand explodes and begins to tear the baby . the rest of her face. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre. The megalomaniacal military officer, the pathetic useless screeches who scream to be killed, the obvious characters who ARE BELOW to die (ie watch over the man chasing a chicken!) I think this movie is really a comedy. There have been many laughable scenes, such as the shed that has been destroyed by a hand grenade (obviously the scene where all the budget was spent) and a climactic scene in which a man shouts: "I'm afraid ... THREAT FOR YOU BLOOD ! ". The clothes are really bad - the same zombies reappear during the movie, wearing the same 'Asian' outfit that can be found in a Bruce Lee movie, and beware of the blue 1960s skirt the motel girl is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the door open as usual for apocalyptic history. A radio DJ who chronicles the entire film turns out to be a zombie and warns his listeners about the "beginning of the end" as the two survivors take off in a helicopter. Hardly "DAWN OF THE DEAD" material, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this movie makes lots of laughs. Blood is minimal, and what is there, is very unconvincing and far less imaginative. The usual blend of black blood, thick green goo coming out of tearful wounds and 'zombie makeup' consisting of green moss. "ZOMBI 3" contributes to a good rental for a sleep party or an evening of beer and popcorn. Also, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
