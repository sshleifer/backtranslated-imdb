There have been very few movies that I could not keep up with. I did this through Battle Field Earth with no problems. But this, this is one of the only worst movies that will ALWAYS be made. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to act. I do not blame her. I would be embarrassed to have this on a resume. I think it's a rare occasion when almost every jury in a movie falls flat on the floor. Well, it happens here. Not to mention the SFX, look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of the rear !!!!!! In the middle of the movie I was still looking for a plot. I've never met one. Save yourself the hassle of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life.
