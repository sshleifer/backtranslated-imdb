Vipul Shah did a really impressive job as a filmmaker in the past. 'Waqt - The Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London' were fun and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, which he produced. His last appearance as filmmaker London Dreams comes as his weakest career. <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams' has a mediocre plot, it's about how success turns friendship into hatred. I agree, it has the potential, but when you watch 'London Dreams', you wonder what's going on? This movie has perhaps the worst climax in recent times. Vipul Shah, the writer, puts Vipul Shah in charge. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the climax is horrible. How can anyone forgive a person who has decided to destroy him? I will not. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask forgiveness from his diaper buddy, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he arrives in India, instead of slapping or abusing him, does Salman receive him with low band and say he was the reason behind the whole fiasco? Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's character as a GOD? If so, you have failed completely. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that you would accept a person who destroyed him with such a good reception? Write what you feel, do not fool us, we are wise enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical, but the music of Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. Not a single song is in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is superb though. He carries the film on his shoulders and does very, very well in the emotional scenes. But again his character is shown as a God, which makes him look like a retard in the end. Ajay is equally good, but Salman overlaps him completely. Asin is wasted, and what is a great talent like Om Puri doing in this movie? Rannvijay hams, although Aditya Roy Kapoor is excellent. Brenda Parekh is just like the vampire. <br /> <br /> In general, this dream is still a dream!
