Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where I should have laughed? There is not a single suggestion or shadow of an idea. The three main actors are pestilent, especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily who can not do a Sicilian accent !!! Not to mention the dreamy insertion on Dracula ... just another expedient, taken from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this "movie" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this movie was actually very difficult to rescue. I would have given "0" / 10, but the lowest score was 1/10 and therefore I had to overestimate it on a mark.
