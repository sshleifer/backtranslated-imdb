Yes. I'll admit it. I believed in all the hype surrounding this work, about the trials and tribulations of 6 people, living in Mexico City in relation to their sex life. And so, I was really hoping to finally see a Mexican movie (in eras) that was both popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately the film was totally disappointing. History presents us with two couples, both with very obvious marital problems. When a third party enters into the life of each couple, their problems hit a turning point. Or absolute absurdity. The plot then turns into a battle of the sexes. The position taken by each group (yes, they literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is blatantly stupid and childish (I think the mood should be there). And everything goes from bad to worse. The performances range from the good (Miss Zavaleta) to the mediocre (Mr Bichir), with Serrano doing an acceptable job on his debut feature. However, the flat circumstances that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the very poor (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc., make the movie fail. Miserably. SPYL had an (impressive) good reception at the box office. Believe in the hype at your own risk.
