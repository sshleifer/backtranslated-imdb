Now I love Bela Lugosi, do not get me wrong, he is one of the most interesting people who has ever made a movie, but he certainly did his part of clunkers. This is just one of those. Lugosi plays Dr.Lorenz, a doctor who had his medical license pulled for unexplained reasons. He is however doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful. It is revealed that she is 70-80 years old. age still Lugosi seems to be in his mid-50s so why is he married to this old woman is never really explained. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these treatments or experiments involved brides that are at the altar being married to some kind of sweet-smelling substance. Lugosi and some of his assistants are believed to steal the body on the way to the morgue and take him back to his laboratory where he is kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state. Then stolen brides have a needle shaken somewhere in their bodies, perhaps in the neck, and then the needle is placed on the body of the wife of Lugosi to bring her back to youth and beauty. We never really see where Lugosi sticks the needle or what he takes from the brides but somehow restores his wife. Apparently old age makes you scream in pain because Lugosi The wife screams a lot until she returns to the younger state. Helping Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie ... an old and strange witch and her two deformed sons ... a son is a big A slow-looking guy who likes to fondle the snoozing brides and the other son is a little average dwarf ... little person, to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three simply pile up and sleep on the sad day of Lugosi. In the lab downstairs. Who are these 3 and how did they become scared Lugosi's assistants, is how many things in this movie, never explained. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a reporter is given the chore for his rudeness. editor to find out where all the stolen brides go. the only thing common among all stolen brides is a rare orchid that is found in them. So she asks around and it is said that there is a world-renowned orchid specialist who lives nearby who just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid. This expert turns out to be scary Dr.Lorenz. She quickly crawls him and disturbs his little house of horrors. I'm not sure where the police were during all this but they came to clean up after the reporter had done all the dirty work. <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugosi's films have always had some kind of unnecessary foolish plot that just made the whole thing smell the high skies. I mean, a world-famous expert on orchids kidnaps brides by sending them a dope. even orchid itself is known to have developed? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then it is later revealed that the young ladies do not even need to be brides for the procedure to work, so why would Lugosi continue to kidnap brides from heavily guarded churches for their experiments and create all the attention and headlines from newspaper Why not get a hooker on the street like a normal pervert would? This clunker reminded me of another Lugosi stink, "The Devil Bat" .... same silly plots and bad acting and the same silly business of "reporter gets a bad face" <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he's scary and sinister enough to keep him interested, at least enough to keep watching him. The woman who plays the reporter was just a terrible actor .... she had no emotion at all, she just handed her lines like a machine gun, spewing them out as fast as he could. Everyone practically exploded as well, when it comes to being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing is watchable, even if only for fans of Bela Lugosi. Lugosi was always so intense even when the photo was a dog. He must have known that he was making terrible pictures, but maybe he also knew that if he gave it all, he would have some of that intensity could shine through all the bad plans and bad acting that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> And he was right ---- we fans of horror, we will always have a love for Bela Lugosi. He gave it all to himself and he was in front of the camera. We give you two f ** ks, Bella.
