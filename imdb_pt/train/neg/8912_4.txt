Dark Rising is your typical horror / science fiction / fantasy poorly produced, obviously produced quickly. It has a strange and inexplicable plot with holes so large that you could fit an elephant through them. Most of the time I did not know what the hell was going on but it did not really matter, it was a simple demon hunter returning from the dimension of hell to save the campers story with confusing things about witches and an evil book with plot elements and characters that do not make sense or disappear totally without any reason. The acting is bad, but honestly there's not much they can do with this script, I'm guessing. There are some topless scenes that is probably the only reason why this bad movie was made (like so many other bad movies). Give this one a pass unless there is nothing else in T.V.
