The main aspect of the Superstar films in their later stages was the frequency, the gap between one film and the next. As a well-established movie star in southern India, the feedback he received before Baba was great. Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he has played in Tamil as a mass hero in 11 years has been only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year. All of these were a great success. He was having an image that many thought could not easily be knocked over. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999), he went into a state of hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in South India, were ready to watch movies of any kind with his superstar in action. So the Tamil film industry decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought the fans would take whatever they showed with the Superstar. But that clearly did not work in this movie. As usual, the hype of the media and the expectations of the fans were far beyond the limit. <br /> <br /> The image of Rajinikanth has been totally damaged. The fans went crazy. The film's collection did not reach the expected level. Reputation of great people fell. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect about this film was the songs of A.R.Rehman. Rehman is known for composing good music for some of the worst films like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu etc. Well, I never thought this movie would join that league. > <br /> You will feel very depressed not because the film was bad, it will be because of the image of the superstar. It took him five years to fully recover him with two films, Chandramukhi and Sivaji, and give back to the fans what they really look for in a superstar movie.
