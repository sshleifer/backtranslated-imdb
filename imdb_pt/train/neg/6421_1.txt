I'm impressed by some of the reviews in this movie. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is horrible. The plot is extremely lazy. It's not scary either. The people out there, who think that being starred by Sarah Michelle Geller, it's as if Grudge has to forget about it. This movie is more like Dark Water except that it's even more predictable and slower than that. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It did not scare me or interest me. Let's face it, this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage, eg. the dead trying to get in touch with the living - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling, etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones who write original horror movies these days are the Japanese and the Koreans. The movies that are coming out of Hollywood, so, are cynical exercises to make money without a bit of respect for the viewer. They are just being expelled
