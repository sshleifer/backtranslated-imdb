My opinion: a tired Christmas comedy. The laughter is tired and the talents behind it seem to be too. <br /> <br /> I love the holidays as much as the next (even though I have a bad case of festive blues), but it seems it's just a dump for a bunch of Christmas comedies that would be bad movies any day of the year. year, but that does not make them less painful during the season. As if we already had enough of Santa's movies (three and * gulp * still counting), who wants to see a movie about his brother? In a plot that would stay at home with Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (except for occasional crude humor and "Little" Santa's Helper wearing a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a premise of a joke that lasts 116 minutes. Of course, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where does he go from there? <br /> <br /> It's a shame. FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have made a nice Christmas comedy that will likely melt along with the snow, but it would have been a lot better than that. Vince Vaughn is his typical snob, but we are led to believe that he is really the long-lost brother of the never-aged Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good old brother to visit him. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) came to watch over Santa Claus, and THIS is close to being closed. Hah! And guess who plays Santa's mother! Kathy Bates, of course. Elizabeth Banks is a helper to Santa Claus Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! The SI does not know if I would praise the cast or if it would. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they are very little to be worked on. <br /> <br /> As for humor, the best FRED CLAUS could invent is Santa's brother. being his exact opposite and some joke about a DJ elf. I have to admit that I had some laughs involving Fred attending a counseling group for famous siblings (where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the laughs start and end there. Worse still, the film even succumbs to the sentimentality that should make us "feel good" and teach us a lesson about "what Christmas really means". Apparently, what Christmas means for Hollywood is to get as much money as possible for Christmas shopping. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5.
