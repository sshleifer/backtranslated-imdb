Do not get me wrong, I love action movies and revenge, I've seen a lot of them since I was a child, including Dolph Lundgren's latest "The Mechanik", which is very good. And Tony Scott certainly knows how to use a camera and even be a genius photographing and editing movies. <br /> <br /> But with "Man on Fire" (and even more so with "Domino"), Scott shows that instead of cleverly using his genius filmmaking skills, he uses it to show and make up for the lack of substance that his material does not offer him. "Man of Fire" is about 2 and a half hours when it should have been at least an hour less. <br /> <br /> The way Scott filmed and edited this movie also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through your movie because your constant camera and flash movements really are one torture to the eye and makes you want to leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes for it. <br /> <br /> Sometimes where the MPAA and the studios have questionable attitudes toward pg-13 ratings, violence, and movies, I also suspect that a $ 70 million movie is made from a B movie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in the ass of a man blows the hand of a guy with a shotgun, all to avenge the death of a little girl who is not even dead! Go ahead, then why a studio will pass a better script because of language or violence ... So said ...
