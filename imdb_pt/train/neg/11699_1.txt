The Thinner plot is decidedly fine. It's disgusting. An obese lawyer directs the gypsy woman, and the gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight ... to the bone. Okay, gypsy curses should be fun, but was weight loss bad? No. Except Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another horror author and screenwriter of this abysmal film, also does. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, he is fat too, haha! Thinner is like a piece of immature shit to a person who complains about how he's never seen anything as disgusting as fat. Hey, I can only say: Well, look at the mirror.
