Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel arriving with budgets of approximately $ 2 million. Some feature long-term works, others feature recognizable casts, and others still feature both - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $ 20 million, but it is painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $ 750,000, if not considerably smaller than that. Few sets are used, several scenes are filmed against the green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish. <br /> <br /> It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is misdirected, poorly executed and misguided, but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for some time and we have high hopes for this film, despite its relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced joined the legions of those spoken by PT Barnum.
