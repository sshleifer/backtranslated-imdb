I know, but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of "depth" (political turmoil, love / lust) can be combined at random with great acclaim from critics (see also "American beauty"). Kaufman's film flows along with free sex scenes interspersed with sequences of often painful dialogues (in one scene I counted three different 'generic European' accents affected by the actors) and state displays can go insane, but do not unite them in coherent meditation kundera offered. and in his long three hours he can almost completely hide Franz, the fourth missing piece in the love triangle at the heart of the plot, and thus sacrifices the novel's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and power relations they get in cases of love. also does not include the screen time token for the son of tomas, used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points that kundera was doing in the novel. combined with the arrogant soundtrack, these flaws make the three hours of this film unbearably heavy in tone but light in content.
