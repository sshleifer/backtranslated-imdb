Well, there's no real plot to speak of, it's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and free sex (which can sometimes be fun too, but it's not in this case). What else can I say about this ...? The action, when it happens, is inventive and there is a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper (one that has to be several kilometers high), but overall there is not much to recommend "Kite". Watch if you want, but you're not losing too much if you skip this ...
