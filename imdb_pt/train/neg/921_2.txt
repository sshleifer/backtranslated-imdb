I rented this to see Vanessa Talor one more time. She can act, but she has no chance in this problem. The opening sequence is an elaborate crane of mountainous landscapes. It must have come from an inventory file because the movie is filmed directly on videotape. Production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ professional. There is a really extravagant animated statue, but no other effect worth noting. This movie is bad, but it's not fun. Players would do well not to mention it in their résumés.
