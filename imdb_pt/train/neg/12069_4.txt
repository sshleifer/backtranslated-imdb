A Z-rated horror filmmaker Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors working in the field of bloody low budget disorder. His films are full of bloodshed, laughing acting, boring subplots and an unfortunate dialogue. The figure is wildly killing guests staying in the family mansion. Unfortunately, this movie is almost bloodless. You do not see the murders except with shadows and a few bloodstains. The rhythm is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting. competent but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed. A generous 4 out of 10. Just be careful: do not confuse the Monson movie with Andy Milligan's equally weak "Legacy of Blood".
