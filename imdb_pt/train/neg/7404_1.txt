I initially gained interest in this movie after reading a comment saying that this movie reminded the critic of Silent Hill. Being a big fan of Silent Hill, and disappointed with his movie debut, I thought of giving him a gift. a chance. Mind, Fearnet only lists this movie as "Dark Floors", not by his full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits, I immediately thought of the band (I had some friends in college who liked them), but I did not think it was important and quickly pushed the thought away. <BR> The film starts strong. Despite the fact that "creepy little girl" was made for DEATH, the good use of audio and the sense of isolation really began to add to the story. The tense atmosphere built quickly, and all indications were that the film was excellent. Since the monsters are the real stars of terror, I could not wait to see what was hidden in the corridors of the hospital where the main characters found themselves trapped ... <br /> <br /> And then the first monster showed and I was very disappointed. By the time the second appeared, I confused it with the fact that it seemed to have just come from a Megadeth concert, and the foolishness made me give up completely. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the atmosphere remained. intact, and the story left you wondering what was going on, but the scares were practically nonexistent. However, I held out the hope that the end would be worth it. Unfortunately, this was not the case. When the movie reached its climax, I was totally disbelieving, and immediately recognized the great evil in its final revelation ... Lordi's vocalist? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was that what the movie was all about? A lot of poor souls being chased around a hospital by Lordi band members? The silly monster drawing suddenly made sense. If you're going to be so tacky, you can do well with Marilyn Manson members, or even KISS there too. Not to mention the fact that I'm sure I saw the ending in one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. Did they have to go and make a whole movie with it? <br /> <br /> Worst of all, when I discovered what was really happening, all I got was a yawn. I'm not going to "ruin" this for you, but I can safely say that it's probably a plot device you've seen before. More likely more than once. <br /> <br /> So unless you're a big fan of Lordi, stay away from it. It's not scary, it does not bring anything new to the table (although it does a decent job borrowing from other horror movies, especially Silent Hill). And I can not emphasize this enough, LORDI is the antagonist. LORDI Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Really, it would be better to try to get scared by watching Slipknot music videos. In other words, it simply is not possible.
