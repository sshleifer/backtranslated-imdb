Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well-established 'hero' whom we know well from books and films. This movie or this story does not work and I felt it is not Agatha's mistake. The cast is not good, the actors are exaggerating and making silly gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) seems fake and to the serious viewer who thinks that twice this film can be seen as a comedy of mystery drama. The actor who plays Herculis Puaro is doing a good job, but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. The story is not very charming, although it is a murder mystery, but who cares about the death of a 45-year-old blonde and grumpy woman in the Iraqi desert? The 'victim' is not nice.
