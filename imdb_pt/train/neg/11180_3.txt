The only good thing about "People I Know" is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid doing. The first major change I had was the way Pacino tried to portray a Georgia accent; sometimes it was weak and unattractive, while in other segments it seemed too exaggerated. Interaction of dialogue and character was terrible along with a weak plot. The supporting cast did an extremely shallow job of keeping the film interesting, and in an hour I still did not see signs of a sturdy plot. The story in general is very boring, and I had to pat myself a few times to keep myself awake. <br /> <br /> This movie will surely bore you too ... avoid at all costs.
