(I will indicate in this review the point where the spoilers begin.) My dissatisfaction is divided: 30% deafness, 70% lackluster writing. <br /> <br /> The 30%: I agree with the first commentator's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and the scope of the stories. I was surprised to see how this movie at best distorts the real New York City by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow that it seems inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl (this comes from someone who likes Gossip). Girl). Some minority characters are written in the stories, but are included by obligation, while we can see the gears under the film so clearly, striving to "be diverse," but falling ever so short. <br /> <br /> The 70% is because everything falls short. All characters, whites and some symbolic minorities, are one-dimensional, cardboard clippings of people's concepts. Worse still, the interactions between them are scripted in such a way that for every vignette in the film, the audience is treated with what I would call a "joke": we have a basic concept, then a joke designed to be clever. twist. But even if we were to stop cynicism for a moment to say, "Okay, that was a surprise" ... the stories are still not as interesting because they are also superficial. When you create stories so that your existence is based only on the unexpected end, you are writing jokes. <br /> <br /> Spoilers below ... <br /> <br /> The movie basically tries to tell romantic stories. That's nice. But the novel is incredible, deep, sometimes complex. These "romantic" stories feature a girl and a boy who, at some point, share the same place and look at each other. Word-exchanging, thoughts are projected through the narration, but they also only manage to communicate to the public only that one person is drawn to another. <br /> <br /> Meaning, there is no seduction (in the broad sense), without tension, nor confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the Other. The only story involving a superficial "seduction" is told only to make the audience be surprised that the guy (Ethan Hawke) is fooled by the girl he is giving up, who unexpectedly ends up being a prostitute. Of course, your words in trying to catch it are interesting to hear and we had fun as we would be if we were next to them, but there's nothing of substance in that story out of "A then B". So it unfolds, if something like a postcard can "unfold", with all the other tales as well: A then B - That's it, the only point is that it happens "on set" in Manhattan. By the way, the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island outline; the only queens are the twinkling of a train journey carried by a character traveling to the West Village. <br /> <br /> It is easy to choose movies that reproduce all common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation and soon. _New York, I Love You_, however, deserves to be subjected to more stringent scrutiny because of its title. We hope to see the real New York and the real New Yorkers, but instead we parade before us the selected slice of a demographic, its characters brought in from The OC, plus a few others to make it look like we're paying attention for diversity. But when we look more closely at who these characters are, the whole farce becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and to the ethnicities and cultures the film shamelessly portrays. <br /> <br /> For example, the story with the movie Latino man with the little white girl in the park, who is confused by two girls as his manny (nanny) when in fact he is the father. Although the last scene of this part has been unnecessary from the point of view of dramatic construction (it would have been much more interesting to end when the mother and the stepfather are taking the girl away), it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learned with certainty that the girl's father is Latino ALSO should inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. Can not the father be just a guy from South America? Now that he is obviously hot, are the public better prepared to accept that he has had a child with a middle-class, high-class white woman? Are we naive enough to demand this? As if a Mexican laborer were obviously very inedible. <br /> <br /> It's not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone. But in all conceivable ways and plots, the taken direction screams status quo, calls for security. All these stories could have become more interesting, even if we had been forced to maintain the unidimensionality of the characters that inhabit them, at least not by choosing standard and obvious stereotypes. Asian girl living in Chinatown being ridiculed by a disheveled old white guy? How about an Asian cougar chasing a white college kid? Again, I'm not saying that the whole concept needs to be changed. That's all. Damn it. premise of history. is so banal - and so they fail to convey anything about why anyone can love New York, out of the ordinary. The real way to have improved the movie would be to write a screenplay that is worth reading. <br /> <br /> I'll admit the sympathy of the soundtrack, the good rhythm of the movie (even if what was being rhythmic was, well, dredge), and the general feel of many of the scenes. The film was very good to sit on, and I did not dissuade anyone from doing so. However, he is saying that the most significant homage to non-superficiality is when the old opera singer says (paraphrased) "This is what I love in New York: everyone is from a different place." Well, you would not know to watch this.
