This was not really a very good movie. There have been many implausible and predictable things that have happened during the course of the film ... but I think most reviewers are missing out on the reason the film is appreciated by a broad audience. THIS MOVIE WAS PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Is not it enough to inspire us all to see this movie? A movie produced by a former NBA star does not show up every day, you know. Beautifully stupid kids in a big house being cut off by a psychopath wielding ax. Every cliche trotted for us to moan. Teenage sex. And everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can not say enough about this movie! Drug use in adolescents! College Hijinx! And everything was produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
