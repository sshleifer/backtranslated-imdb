This is a movie that had a lot to live on. in the year of its release, legendary film critic Barry Norman called it the worst movie of the year and I heard nothing but bad things about it, especially a plot that was criticized for being too complicated. <br /> <br /> Honestly the plot is a kind of red herring and the film suffers even more when the word "plot" is used because as far as I can see, there is no plot as such. There is something involving Russian gangsters, a character named Pete Thompson, who is trying to impregnate his wife Sarah, and an Irishman named Sean. As they all fit into something called "plot", I'm not sure. It's hard to explain the tangles of Guy Ritchie's films, but if you watch some of his films, I'm sure we can all agree that they all have one, no matter how complicated they may seem at the first screening. Similarly, a James Bond movie, although the plots are stretched with action scenes. You will have a serious problem believing that RANCID ALUMINUM has any kind of central storyline that can be convincingly explained. <br /> <br /> Taking a look at the list of castles, you will play enough to know what kind of movie you will be watching . Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she is doing nothing to become inconsistent. Steven Berkoff gives a bad name to the actors (and he plays a character named Kant who sums up the wit of this movie) while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this <br /> /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it is totally forgettable. I saw this a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long critical review telling people what they are giving up watching, but so far I've forgotten why. But that does not change the fact that I remember not liking this piece of garbage immensely
