I have read some good reviews on this board for "Mr. Scarface," but for anyone not started in the Italian gangster movies genre like me, the picture will probably make very little sense. In fact, after the initial setup involving the 10 million lire stroke, the image has turned into a routine revenge film with a slight twist in the character identity of Rick (Al Cliver). The entire plot of the gang war was confusing to me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, he is the one who gave this picture a life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it rather unbelievable that the Manzari henchmen who chased Tony down the street did not leave before Tony even laid a hand on them. In spite of all his training as a title character, Jack Palance was wasted without the least ceremony in an almost anticlimactic ending, making the US work title "Scarface" a moot point. I have seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that not all of them work; I think in this case, my first look at a spaghetti gangster movie also failed.
