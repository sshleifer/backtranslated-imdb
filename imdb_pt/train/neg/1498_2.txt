Justifications for what happened to your movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunks and receptionists doing scripts rewrite aside, let's just get this movie as it is offered without any irrelevant explanations. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. Straight craptastic. Instead of rewriting what can serve as a plot, I will make a highlight of a few curious points that made me scratch my head. <br /> <br /> A class (of 5) takes a field trip to a history class in the middle of damn Ireland. These students may be Canadians or Americans, it's hard to say. That was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is pretty obvious too. One student seems to know nothing about the story and is basically the "dumb jock" character from a 80-song kick ass number, except when he channels Randy from Scream. A character may be Chris Klein's stunt double. He has a girlfriend who is probably dead but never really established if that is true. A character is grumpy and removed from his peers ... just ... because ... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. <br /> <br /> Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called "Sir" more than once. He is very sinister and wears a knitting cap. Her cousin is a porn actress with the worst Irish accent of shady movies in my life and most likely beyond her. <br /> <br /> Picturesque Ireland features many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks that appear more than once in cut scenes. <br /> <br /> Producers have gotten a discount on the volume of fake casings. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Unbeknownst to me, innate freaks have access to new hunting knives. Maybe there's some kind of outdoor store in the neighborhood, with a deaf and blind employee working the register. <br /> <br /> Unbeknownst to me, if you've been raised for about 600 years, as history tells you to believe it happened, you end up being a bit jagged but incredibly agile and strong enough. Genetics is a wonderful game of data. <br /> <br /> There may or may not be more than one freak in this movie. Reference is made to "them" and we see shadows, but only a strange-looking face is ever seen. And when a strange guy is finally dead, apparently the whole danger is past. I'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought of equipping a second man in full makeup, so they just used the one. That's what it looks like on the screen, anyway. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> Also, note that in addition to these shiny new knives, the innate freaks have access to sleek leather outfits, as once Richard Grieco cuts off his ties, there are new ones ready for the next sucker to be tied. .. which also escapes later, because the chains give enough clearance to just undo them, causing you to wonder why even bother tying someone. <br /> <br /> A corpse in a shack will be full of worms after what I think is about 2 hours have passed. The said corpse will also have glasses when no character has used them. Curious. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson appears on stage without a reason on the left, talk for 2 minutes, disappears on the stage to the left. In the middle of a giant forest. This is not uncommon, as Gary can also appear out of nowhere, which is also known as what exists on the land of TV. <br /> <br /> Ms. Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes disappear as my hopes that this movie would not suck the wind. <br /> <br /> I offer a special nod to the character "Creator," the poor girl who was used by the freaks. for months (or perhaps years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eye shadow and emoticons on camera with all the passion and conviction of a plush chihuahua. <br /> <br /> The end of this film was clearly approached by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability who has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline consumption over the years. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this was not a random crap that I found in the late night movie network, apparently people heard about it and even film through their production. How sad for all of you. I have nothing more to say. May God have mercy on us all.
