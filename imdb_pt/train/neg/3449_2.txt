Fortunately, there's no video of this wannabe western being a vehicle for the Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering. The story of a ferret who lives in the reputation of his great armed brother and who is driven out of town by villains just to rejoin his people with a new found courage must have been written by a backstage writer. All in all, this program smells bad. The story is basically boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. We must start from the other reviewer who found it "... underestimated ..." Critics hit on the time and deservedly so. You'll have to catch him at the last show if you wake up late and have a sleepless attack. But if you can sit down with it, you have more guts than most of my movie friends.
