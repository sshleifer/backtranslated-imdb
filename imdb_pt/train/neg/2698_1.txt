This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. It portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quickly he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it. The Ice Cube character is the epitome of a thought-provoking black man who was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched the relations between the white and black characters who were trying to get closer to each other. When Omar Epps says "I need to be with my people," this racist remark spoke volumes. And John, do not think for a minute that Thomas Jefferson's photo on the tower's staircase did not catch my eye. Good touch!
