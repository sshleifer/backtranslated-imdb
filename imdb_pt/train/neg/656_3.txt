Note: I could not force myself to write a constructive review of Prom Night. This simply can not be done. Instead, I went through what I thought while watching the movie. Things I Thought While Watching Prom Night: <br /> <br /> -I'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will occur, just for the main character to wake up just before biting him . Of course, when I say "elaborate deaths," I mean off-screen throat cuts or stab wounds in the stomach. The whole thing "just a dream" was not ruined by Dallas? Speaking of which, I wonder if a couple of stab wounds in the gut will cause immediate death. <br /> <br /> -The film has only ten minutes and I can already count the clich√©s of horror in both hands. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Even after meeting the protagonist's boyfriend, I'm convinced he's going to die. Anyone want to place bets? <br /> <br /> -The killer in this movie is a teacher obsessed with the main character, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think "Donna" is a horrible name for a main character in a horror movie?) He spends three years in a maximum security prison before leaving and finds Donna celebrating his prom. Although there is no explanation for the taste, I wonder seriously who would take all this time to chase after someone as monotonous as Donna. <br /> <br /> - High schools allow prom balls to take place in hotels and do not accompany students. Apparently, students are perfectly capable of buying a hotel room and going in and out whenever they want. I suppose if this point were not in place, the movie would be 90 minutes of people bored and randomly biting the dust whenever they went to the bathroom. I suppose the trade-off for your excitement is my total boredom with everything. I already played "count the pieces of chewing gum chewed under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I'm only at the 20 minute mark. How else do I indulge myself? <br /> <br /> Note to yourself: do not forget the milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> Argument Protect: You've used amazing fakes to get past this movie and all the other horror remakes this year. <br /> <br /> - The 1980 version of this movie was not so good, but compared to this remake, it was like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather. He had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of his many post-Halloween horror films and had a little "twist" in the end. I miss Jamie Lee. I wish she acted more. Apparently at the ball there is not much dancing going on. Instead, girls get into fights with their boyfriends about where they plan to go to college. I hear all those faculties being created by name, and I can not help but think of who these girls have to cheat on the entrance exam to get in. <br /> <br /> -The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning material and clean his mess between scenes. That's the only logical explanation as to why he might stab someone to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and when someone arrives in the hotel room, there is no sign of fighting. (On another side note: This is a very lazy killer.Michael Myers went hunting after his victims, just saying.) <br /> <br /> "It's official: the whole audience in the theater is rooting for the killer. What triggered this? Was it always Donna returning to the hotel room while the sirens were leaving, ordering them all to leave the building? Were her dreams constant, and how, even after going through something dramatic in the dream, did she insist on re-stamping her steps on a T-shirt? Or was it the unconvincing performance of Brittany Snow? I'll have to say it was all that. <br /> <br /> -Ok, who had "he dies off the screen in the third act"? You win the pot. <br /> <br /> -Finally, the movie is over. My friend turns to me and says "Donna was not very smart". This is the understatement of the week. It's like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week of power failure is a small inconvenience. <br /> <br /> -I can not wait to get Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone gave it do a favorable review. <br /> <br /> - I can not recommend this. I refuse to recommend this. This is as lazy for a horror movie as any other, and the only way to enjoy the cheese plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately, for theatergoers, alcohol is not served. Rating: * out of ****
