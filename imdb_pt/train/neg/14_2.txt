There are times when you finish a movie so you want to get a refund for the time you just spent. This was one of those moments. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes to endure ... and I would like to have ... <br /> <br /> The pace that a man moves from a controlled, direct life to a completely without personality and irresponsibility could never be so quick. <br /> <br /> From a graduation celebration to the foreseeable end Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) man of privilege and culture is allowed to seduce by a woman, by violence and by mental alteration substances. Of course, the woman's part is understandable when observing the talents of beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But it is impossible to understand an aspect of a pound of drugs, violence, and dedication to a person he has just met. <br /> <br /> Frankly, besides being able to face Nathalie Kelley and Monica. Keena, this movie has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time ... do something else ...
