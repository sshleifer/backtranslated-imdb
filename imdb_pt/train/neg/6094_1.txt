I have been amply convinced to write this comment for a number of reasons: 1) This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen 2) Unless it gets more criticism, it will not be listed on the worst all-time movie list - which deserves to be 3) I was kind of lucky - I paid five pounds for that. I saw it in stores for Â£ 15. DO NOT PAY VERY MUCH FOR THIS MOVIE! You will get very angry 4) There are a lot of movies out there in the horror genre that do not get a fair rating (in my opinion) and giving this movie a higher rating than they are criminal <br /> < > The plot summary: A friendless guy meets a hobo who promises the world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone as someone else. Our hero cunningly transforms into a teenager and joins his gang - sitting on swings, baby-sitting. He kills them one by one until he is tracked down and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? For starters, the acting is VERY VERY bad. Someone compared school production. No, this is worse than any performance I've seen on the school stage. <br /> <br /> I bought some of these forbidden films from the vipco DVD company and I was not as disappointed as this was. Ok, the acting is bad, but the film can not deliver in any other sense. What was the point in making this movie when there is not even any blood! Okay, no blood. What more could a movie like this offer? Breats No, not even any excitement! <br /> <br /> It is true that this film may have a certain charm in its ingenuity, but any potential buyer / observer of this film should be reasonably warned that this movie is worth, at best, only one in ten.
