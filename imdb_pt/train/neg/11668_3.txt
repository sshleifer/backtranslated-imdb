There are beautiful pictures of the landscape. Writers putting mouths in the actors' mouths. With smaller actors, this show would be silly. 'Art must elevate mankind or it is BS.' It is not so because the art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side. The main character even says that whoever does not drink hides the shadow side. Wrong, he lived in darkness and repressed his black side drinking and being one-dimensional, not expanding his horizons with anything other than landscapes. There was no respiratory organism in his work, no expression of his pain. All the artist did was limit himself to playing a dozen landscapes. The discussions between the characters were of elementary school, trivial things always giving the single character the advantage that the writer wanted. I tried liking it after reading all the first wow reviews here. I had to dig deep to see those I agreed. I think the great comments were from those connected to the movie. I was only moved once in the end. The boy was very passive. The scenery was good and the music ridiculous. Just my opinion, but nowhere shows for me.
