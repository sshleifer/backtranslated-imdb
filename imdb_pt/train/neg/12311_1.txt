I know I've already added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old fogy of the Baby Boom generation that grew stuck to a blinking black and white image of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason etc. Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born, but I had the pleasure of discovering Bilko courtesy of Phil Silver of BBC2. I wonder if I would have liked Steve Martin's farce if I had not seen or heard of Phil Silvers-I do not know-I might have. <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers who think about this movie is worthy of a '10' admit that they have not seen the original. I can only ask you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. If after watching the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Daneman Daneman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin et al do you still think that Steve Martin's movie is anything above '2' - me I support you beer ....
