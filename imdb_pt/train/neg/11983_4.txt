Marie Dressler carries this Depression-era drama about a gentle banker, who recently aired on TCM during the April Fools comedy month. If you come with the expectation of big laughs, courtesy of Dressler-Polly Moran's team, you will be disappointed, as this is really a very pessimistic movie. It's also very poorly done, surprisingly considering it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's skeletal cinematography is strictly of the school 'set up the camera and do not move it', often to the detriment of the cast, who finds himself delivering lines off the screen (it's like panning and digitizing the print before it existed!) Or have their heads cut off. The film does not even have a credited director, underlying the apparent nocturnal nature of production. Overall, it's an unsatisfactory mess, with Dressler often exaggerating and just that bizarre and final roll into the bathroom to separate it.
