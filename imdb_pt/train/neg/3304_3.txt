Greenthumb Grace is left without money after the death of her husbands, so she turns into ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. Looks promising and the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn does not disappoint, but the material is very thin. In fact, there's a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to "Give me one" (a toke) and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts strangely. Yes, it's humor, so a nun would be bored. Saving Grace does not seem to know what it wants to be: stunning cinematography and imposing rhythm evoke memories of Ryan's Daughter, while the irreverent whim of the town's people can be taken from any episode of the Antiques Roadshow. It accelerates after the first hour, but it's too clich√©d to care. The climax can only be unpredictable when presenting the most shameless Deux ex Machina I have ever seen.
