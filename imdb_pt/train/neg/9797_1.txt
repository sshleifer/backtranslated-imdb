Nowadays it's kind of a trend to look at all the shows from the early '90s like classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were / are undoubtedly good, this is just crap. I watched this show a lot in those days, since I got a lot of reruns on TV back then, and even as a kid I did not like that. Even an 8-year-old can see how much people in Power Rangers are exaggerating, and how much the special FX sucked even back then. When the show does not resort to painfully bad 'fight' scenes, it haunts the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teenagers and their little social problems from time to time. I do not know about you, but I did not give a damn about any of that, and it's basically a lot until they have to 'fight' with a guy again in a very clich√© alien costume with fireworks or some toy. -robot. You never feel "involved" in any way with this program, and the fact that most actors act as if there really is no interest, other than that your wallet only adds to the lack of feeling. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing memorable about this show, and it's pretty amazing that it has so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All of this is just a quick way to make some money though. I challenge any 'fan' to tell me what really stands out in episodes that should be so good because I could not find anything that is a little appealing to kids. My guess is that most "Power Rangers" fans will tell me that I "do not understand" anyway, or something. I do not really care; that was crap at the time and it's still crap now.
