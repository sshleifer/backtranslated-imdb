Bingo is the game, bullshit is the name. Rarely has the screen been tarnished by a mixture of ill-finished conspiracy theories, puritan pudding and nonsense of the new era. Most of the story takes place in Viciente, a Cristian resort in the Peruvian jungle. Think of Tolkien's Rivendell as the Star Trek Planet Baku, inhabited by moody followers of a not-so-mysterious but surprisingly narrow-minded cult of love and peace. Thanks to the horrible performance and coarse production design (the multicolored visualization of the mysterious healing "energy" is particularly hideous), "The Celestine Prophecies" looks like a discarded episode of the 'Twilight Zone' of the 1980s. Factual errors related to history and nomenclature of the church are plentiful. I can not believe Hector Elizondo has agreed to be a part of this. Maybe it was done without your consent, Bowfinger style. May the Lord have mercy on the director, the screenwriter, the author of the novel, and the poor souls who watch the movie or read the book.
