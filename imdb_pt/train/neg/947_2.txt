As one who lived, and still remembers that decade vividly, if the real 70's had been kind of funny and (un) normal, they would have been much nicer. Real children at that time did not act or behave in any way near The young people of the country were still under the influence of the hippies and drug culture, all that rebellion of the 60s that generated, especially in the department of behavior, petulance, presumption , selfishness. - straightness, childishness, irrationality of them - none of the characters exhibits any of this. <br /> <br /> Someone likened "Happy Days," and I can see why: both were sitcoms that happen 20 years before the actual time they were broadcast, and both offer only superficial depictions and cliches of the present times , not even close to all its reach, just showing the obvious things - fashions, toys, music, contraptions, etc. and that's it. For those too young to remember, or not born then, trust me, the 70's were not like that, more than "Happy Days" were like the real 50's, since "M * A * S * H ​​*" did not accurately portray life on a US Army medical base during the Korean War, etc.
