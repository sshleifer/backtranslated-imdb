The story is a bit slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo does not look very good and I could not understand half of the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for that role. Melvyn Douglas, in turn, plays her normal and improbable role, and Constance Bennett is more or less like that, except for some of her screams, which were funny. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Roland Young had the best part in the film. I wish he had more lines, since he disappeared in the second half of the story. Besides, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon look so young. I'd only seen her in those crazy roles she'd played from the late '60s to the' 80s and a crazy old woman. In terms of history, the best part may have been the last few minutes when we see a stuntman doing incredible things on skis, pretending to be Douglas falling on the slopes. That was incredible and humorous footage. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can see where this movie - Garbo's last one - was not a blockbuster. It just creeps too much, talking about disappointments. It's a boring story. Garbo knew that too and gave up.
