<br /> <br /> Upon concluding my rendition of "Trance" or "The Eternal," or whatever the producers are calling this movie, I wondered, "Of all the bad movies I could have seen, could not have seen at least one that was fun? "Even if a movie is not well done in terms of acting, direction, writing or what you have, it can at least be fun and therefore worth it. But it's not just this bad movie in artistic value, it's incredibly annoying. For a plot of such thinness, it moves terribly slowly, with little dramatic tension. At the very least, in a low-level entertainment attempt, the characters' deaths might have been cold and / or bloody, but the creators of this drug also failed in that department. <br /> <br /> Is this movie successful? Almost nothing, unless you have fun watching Christopher Walken, who is able to be brilliant, put so little effort into his acting that he falls into auto-parody mode (why did he decide to make that movie anyway?). I give this movie 3/10, because, God help us, there really have been worse movies made before.
