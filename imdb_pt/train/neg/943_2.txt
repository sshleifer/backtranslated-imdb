Here's a little interesting movie that strictly gives the phrase "low budget" a horrible name. Our physics teacher who has about nine children creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization." Students are hopelessly killed by false coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. Sounds like a resurrection of the classic B movies of the 50's, right? Not! Not an example of high pitched fun, that's way, off the mark. A glamorous display of breasts and butts follows our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror that should have 99.44% more in the first place. Entertainment at the bottom of the barrel at its best, aided by liters of red blood and bodies of dead students. Atrocious movies like this would make the catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who holds a master's degree in film production! It's an automatic "F", so stay calm!
