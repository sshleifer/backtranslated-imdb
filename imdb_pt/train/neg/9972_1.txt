PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but he gets into trouble later. That Junior can drive grandpa's car. He can scare people with a bear. It can put a room on fire! It's a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. A sequel is an even worse fate. Instead, rent CHICKEN RUN. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** I give.
