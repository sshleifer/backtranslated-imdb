A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the Left in this country simply does not understand. They never did. And liberalism continues to slip more and more into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a little baseball star who decides to stop playing ball in protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculed until a bunch of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, join in his cause. Not only do some of them join the cause. By the time their movement reaches its apogee, entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons, since no one else will play. Just to take this review forward, I am prepared to grant them this premise. Even though it never happens in a million years, I just imagine it could, so go from there. <br /> <br /> I do not remember quite how, but some kind of agreement is reached, and the boy decides to return to the game he loves in an incredibly silly and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing the message of this film, let me say that this film is poorly written, directed and directed. Even if someone agrees with the boy's posture, it would be impossible to overcome how much the film was built. And this is a shame, as there are many good actors who are wasted. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English does as well as he could with his character, and I'd like him to try acting in more movies. Unfortunately, it is much easier to find work in the world of NBA coaches. One person wants Mr. English to teach more about these types of NBA today than to shoot the rock a little better. Alex certainly knew how to put the ball in the hoop. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie message goes, it's just wrong. Clear and simple. All those nuclear warheads hidden in those missile silos in the west, WAR PREVENTION !!!!! It would be a thing for this boy and his flock to protest a real war or the use of nuclear weapons. These weapons were never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. Neither side during the Cold War was crazy enough to fire a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what might have happened between the US and the USSR? <br /> <br /> The creators of this film obviously wanted the children in America to take up their cause and follow in Chuck's footsteps. Children in America, however, are smarter than the freaks in the left wing who created this obstacle. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth only 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie about the dangers of nuclear war, stay with Dr. Strangelove. Mr. Newell, you're not Frank Capra!
