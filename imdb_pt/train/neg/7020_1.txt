Watching Smother was perhaps the longest non-90 minutes of my life. There was no laughter to be had; in fact, I do not remember smiling. Diane Keaton was horribly bland as a middle-aged smoker dog collector, the authoritative maternal character, a relentlessly annoying woman who clearly suffers from some sort of personality disorder. She is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and, worst of all, annoying. <br /> <br /> I think I should briefly mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a long series of movie cliches - the distant, socially incompetent relative who is just trying to invade "The industry," the rough and suffering father, but somehow still lovely, the wife in gentle ways who can only " I take more (but eventually goes beyond discord and resignedly returns home), the herd of undomesticated dogs that like to chew cushions while everyone else is off, etc. God, who snores. I've never been a fan of Diane Keaton, and Smother just reminded me why. "Overactivity is exaggerated, no matter how many pictures you've made at its height." His attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating. <br /> Although I like Dax Shepard and can even tolerate Liv Tyler, his performances were so dull and dull that it was clear that none of the actors cared about this movie.That was fine, because neither did I. The Tagarelic and incessant and selfish Keaton was intolerable and sometimes Shepard's dislike for her seemed genuine. At the end of the movie I wanted to slap her. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
