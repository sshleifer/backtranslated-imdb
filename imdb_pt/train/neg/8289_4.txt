I'm sorry, but this is such a bad movie that it's hilarious. Soccer hooligans arguing in a travel accommodation? Suits Tones ?! Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he did it, it is as far from the truth as you can get. <br /> <br /> The cast was atrocious ... Gary Oldman as a football hooligan? He does not look scary, acts scary or even like someone who would like football. What about the Yeti? What the hell? Suits, masks and sitting in a Travelodge infantile teasing each other with "it's about the time you have your diaper on". Please. <br /> <br /> And the Yeti gang is spraying ICC underwear? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can take this movie seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10. It is possibly the most inaccurate picture of the vandalism crisis of the late eighties I have ever seen.
