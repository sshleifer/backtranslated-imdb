This movie was extremely silly when things started to happen. I could not care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and the lead actor (forget his name) also got on my nerves. I can not remember how it ended and so on, but the whole idea of ​​aliens having human bodies and everything seemed stupid in this movie, things did not go well. My dad told me it's a stupid movie ... I should have listened to him.
