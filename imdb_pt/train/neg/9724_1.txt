Poor Tobe Hopper. He directed an all-time horror classic "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then everything he did was horrible. This is probably the worst ... and that's saying a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to make things (and people) catch fire ... or something. Hardly an original idea (does anyone remember "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally everything is done wrong! Pathetic acting (even Dourif!), Asinine script, incredible production values, bad special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! A must miss ... not even good for laughs.
