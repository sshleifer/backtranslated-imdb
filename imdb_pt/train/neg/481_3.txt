Every time a film is so myopic in its desire to present a particular end or point of view that it simply does not bother with a real story, it is annoying. These are the types of films in which the end or point of view is designed first, and the story simply addressed. For this reason we often talk about the story "jumping through hoops" as it twists, trying in vain to progress to the preordered end in a logical way. <br /> <br /> The story in "Comet Over Broadway" does not just jump through hoops, it's a three ring circus. It's so ridiculous, so ill-conceived, so hypocritical, that if you're prone to speaking aloud to the screen, you'll keep talking long enough before you're done. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this roadmap. Fossa is that of a woman who chooses between family and profession. Since everything is so terribly confusing, it will end up being offensive to people of both opinions. So in the end, there is no point to the story, the subject becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with bad scripts, the acting does not save anything.
