I'll start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything about them was great, the costumes, songs, lyrics (since the translation was good :)), choreography, everything I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene . <br /> <br /> But it's about that. <br /> <br /> I understand, artistic, blablabla, but too much is too much. Very quiet (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours listening to footsteps and groans from time to time, really ...), very boring (no movie should be boring, no matter how deep it was!), Very pornographic scenes (I understood really, I understand they were filming a porn movie there, but really, REALLY, really that's too much) I really think cinema should be to watch and this one definitely is not watchable at all. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
