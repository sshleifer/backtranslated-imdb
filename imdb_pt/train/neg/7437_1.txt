This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent. Full of clich√©s and a plot that makes absolutely no sense! I can not believe that so many people have given a horrible movie to 10. My guess is they are the filmmaker's lackeys. <br /> <br /> If I could give a zero to this movie, I would. Too bad the IMDb does not allow this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it, because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. What is sad is that I never had high expectations of this movie to begin with and I still felt little changed. Take my word for it, do not waste your $ 8 on this piece of junk. The only entertainment I got out of the movie was making fun of the director's name. All in all, highly NOT RECOMMENDED!
