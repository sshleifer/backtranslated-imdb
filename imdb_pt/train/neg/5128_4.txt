This initial entry into the patriotic category slapped the handsome, young Gene Tierney on ads and posters, but you have to wait a long time before seeing her, riding a Hollywood camel train. Previously, we set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely do well but who need to recover in the face of the attack. I saw Sanders like so many nice idiots it was fun to witness a rare turnaround. However, Bruce Cabot's fascination is pretty much a mystery to me - he's basic and not subtle in comparison, but I always felt that he had just emerged, smiling, under a car, covered in grease and a sixth year . Some people like it that way, just like the character of Gene's gypsy queen. This is an action adventure filler, and just as we were warned of local invaders with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the English on their lands, there is a final battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of everything. This feature requires nothing more than your attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who did whatever was best matched. It was almost more interesting to identify the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of her early roles. Two or two and a half stars out of five. MDM
