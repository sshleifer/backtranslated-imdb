I really like the cast, but the story unfolds slowly. Danny Glover does a good job of asking you if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have as much space in the story as he could have had. I found that the first scene was a bit exaggerated compared to the unfolding of the story. I would watch again though. I rated a 5 (I wish I could rate it as a 5.5)
