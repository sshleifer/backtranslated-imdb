This is a low budget horror / creature movie Roger Corman. A DinoCroc is created when the manipulation of prehistoric genes is uncontrolled. A designed crocodile first kills one of their own, then gets the taste of humans and becomes a terror that grows rapidly after escaping. None of the characters have depth, but they are not the focal point. We only have a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best "kill" scenes in a small-budget movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is an idiot character trying to use a trio. Dog legs to the bait and it becomes croc food itself. There was nothing left on the pier, but at the foot of the ankle. No prominent roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an obnoxious professional crocodile hunter, Costas Mandylor. I was very impressed with the seductive Joanna Pacula as the respectfully feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming itself as a jar of pickles.
