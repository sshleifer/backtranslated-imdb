If you did a genre movie in the late 80's, you basically had a 50/50 chance of being placed underwater or in a prison (unfortunately, we've never had a prison movie). Framed by murder by Mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends up on death row, next to Frankie's brother Frank (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the least of Derek's problems as a dishonest government agent (and Mafia banker) Colonel Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus. This is the only film that Saxon directed during his celebrated career. For a guy who has worked with several directors, it seems that the only ones he got were the cheapest ones - the Italians. Of course, it's low budget, but this can not excuse forged staging, gunshots, or awkward exposure in the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon has left her a bit bloody and he works on a hilarious nudity scene (our lead falls asleep during a prison rebellion just to fantasize a female scientist). Cole, who looks like a more sturdy Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as the Stoic and Franciosa leadership - boasting a really bad rug - gives it all to himself as the clich√© mafia boss. The finale takes place at Marty McKee's favorite spot, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia has released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
