The film My Name is Modesty is based around an episode that occupies about a page of the novel Blaise, called Night of the Morningstar. He describes an incident in which young Modesty (17 in the book, 20 and a few years in the film) affirms his leadership in a war over a casino. As this is set before Blaise's real adventures, his trusted helper Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the main problems, as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin has certainly always been one of the fascinating aspects of novels and long comic books. The other problem is that the film is simply incredibly annoying because it's just a small episode exploded in a screenplay. The cast is fine, but Alexandra Staden is not really convincing as the heroine and really too old for the role of playing the young modesty. I have the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution not to lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.
