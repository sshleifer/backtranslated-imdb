This is a film that depends only on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to be noticed. It is. The dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of the "sex scenes" is absolutely absent. The acting and the dialogue are more suitable for high school children, but the subject is aimed at adult audiences. It's a cowardly, shallow movie. It could have been so much better if it had a story and more drama. Oh, and one more thing: why are internal monologues so used? Makes it seem so cheap. All in an embarrassing film for Romanian cinema, as well as for the mature audience that is trying to see it. I know the media are scarce, but that's not always an excuse for a flopping movie like that. please start using some good actors in your films and stop recycling them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can not act!
