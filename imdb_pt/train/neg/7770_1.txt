This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. As I was nearing the end of The Cold, I came to the unbelievable conclusion that this movie was in fact still worse than that scare of the 60's. The story ?? how is it ?? is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games. Whoever can keep up the pace and survive until the end will win $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple plot, but Rebane still manages to make the procedures somehow incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten. Nothing makes much sense. And then it ends. Strangely. I mean, what the heck was this ending exactly? I think you're left to draw your own conclusions. The values ​​of production and acting are undoubtedly a pornographic film standard. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not that good. She is so incredibly terrible that she is attractive. Unfortunately, the same thing can not be said about this holiday as a whole, it's just a bargain router.
