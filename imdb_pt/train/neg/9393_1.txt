Really, truly, terribly, extravagantly, horrible. But actor Clayton Moore (the film Lone Ranger) acquits competently as an actor. He is the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare treatment, for five minutes, if you want to probe the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects, Southern California as "the moon" (over and over and over again), and acting so unprecedented that it can be a parody. . . except of course it is not - no humor here, except involuntarily. <br /> <br /> The dialogue can be worse than any of these other aspects, and the costumes. . . Well, enough said. Plot? What plot? The bad guy (well, the bad guy) and his henchmen, including his land agent named Krog (listen carefully or you'll suspect it's a parody of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc's name) and his inept gunsels (which, however , have revolvers that never need to be recharged, just like the Commando Cody, so there are several fire-fighting stunts. Enjoy.
