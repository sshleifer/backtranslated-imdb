Now I had the best intentions when I watched that one. I like some of Tony Scott's work, also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie, even though I heard it from other people. But that was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was all too much. Allow me to elaborate. Miss Knightley was exaggerating, and not in a good way. The people who performed well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but the screen time was not able to save the movie. <br /> <br /> There were some scenes that jumped at their originality, but somehow it looked like they were written by someone other than the lead writer. A certain melody was used around 4 times, which actually began to appear after the second time. I firmly believe in not using the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> In addition, the issue really came out here, since the cut rate is quite high. Oh, and the repetitive echo of some of Keira's speeches sounded corny after hearing it for the second, third and fourth time, and so on. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see an action movie that is high-paced and "a little" funny, and you do not care about everything I mentioned above, you might like . <br /> <br /> (On a side note: I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley.)
