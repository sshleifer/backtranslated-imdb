An actor's first film is usually something to miss - often the first job where the lack of film experience of all involved is actually on display, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than that, by the standards of 1982, this is so bad that it's hysterically funny. Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget, most of the cast's performance is hard, wood and caricature - a cross between a high school play and a bad community theater. The noise of the near traffic usually suffocates the dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative in a way that seems more forced and expeditious than natural and organic. Scenes are planned and agitated, and even if the characters go through a period of years, neither children nor adults grow old. <br /> <br /> I believe it is possible to make a Christian movie that is palatable to a movie. public, secular but often the creators of such films are so focused on 'The Message' or in this case their own autobiographical ties to the project that the values ​​of good filmmaking are left out. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that the lead character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast member.) Fortunately, Michael Madsen was far more interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films. Careers like his certainly are not built into movies like this.
