I was drawn to see this movie by its power, but in the end is all it offers. It plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about corruption in big cities. His greatest failure is his predictability and absolute lack of suspense. We know who the bandits are from the beginning, and just follow them as they fall like dominoes. The film to her credit refrains from gratuitous violence and sex, but has forgotten to replace otherwise good and clean romance and emotion. All the taste of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola. "Q & A", which also happens in New York, is a much better alternative, as is "LA Confidential".
