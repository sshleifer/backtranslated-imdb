I saw this movie and the other one. Trinity is my name and I think this is worse than the first. I have no idea why they did another movie, it was stupid and useless to say that I have them all. I sat through them number of times and still it takes me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie took me to the wall. If I had a different plot or at least one more plot and more comedy, it could have been more fun and worth the $ 5 I spent buying all the movies. But you make mistakes so I would say save your money and not bye this movie or any of those who go with it trust me on this one.
