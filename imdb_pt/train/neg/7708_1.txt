The only aspect of this film that saves you from being my least favorite piece of celluloid is a single line pronounced by an agent trying to infiltrate man-eating tomatoes wearing a tomato costume: "Can someone please pass the ketchup?" I strongly recommend that anyone with a sleep disorder use this film as a sedative; works better than an overdose of demarol.
