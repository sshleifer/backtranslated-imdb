To summarize this film: Without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of disturbed characters drinking or making bad jokes. The music is just awful, the humor is not funny and all the female idiots jerks or total geeks. It seems to me that the movie was actually written by a 14 year old boy who thinks drinking is cool, that women are designed to please men and everyone who opposes this view are geeks. In addition, the film has nothing to do with the original American Pie films, in addition to some names and Mr. Levenstein, who is a minor character in this film. The only good thing about this movie are the beautiful girls. Do not watch this movie and do not be fooled by the rating of 5.4, because it is obviously overrated and deserves nothing above 2.
