Not to be confused with the above-average supernatural thriller "The Sentinel." The Sentinel was a big hole in a movie for me, not delivering consistent action, a couple of critics promised in the back. To me, it seemed like everyone was Halfassing, and only there to make some quick money, because this seemed very made for a TV movie. The Sentinel is a replay of several better films, such as "In The Line Of Fire," which has no originality, and watching Michael Douglas out there seemed a little silly in my opinion. The main problem aside from his lack of originality, had to be the weak beat. I used to get distracted while trying to watch this movie, while watching how much time had been spent, more than once. Not only did the miscastar with Eva Longoria, who failed to convince the value of a lick. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas is generally a dependable actor, here he is obviously going through the motions. He does not convince as a man in a run or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he's fine, nothing more. He tries to sound rude, but he manages to be milder than anything else, and to be honest, he does not seem so interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She did not convince herself in her role, and it was pure eyesight. Kim Basinger is very terrible as the first lady. She seems bored with tears, and her role is a waste, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has a great role in the end but not enough to import to me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. The Sentinel is yet another political thriller that bores me with tears. He's too old, too tired, and more importantly, lack of effort sucks. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
