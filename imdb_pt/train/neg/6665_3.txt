OK, the story - a simpleton maniac enters a life from bored to death young girl and her younger brother and wreaks havoc on their lives - is a bit interesting. Anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has some ...) - execution is everything. <br /> <br /> That's what bothered me with this movie. And that bothers me immensely. The pace (direction, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the climax expected. We've seen those damn roads five, six, seven times - why? The Norton character's problems were seen as a child's play, not deep enough to understand his / soul / blah problems and to cheer for or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a nutcase? The references to "Taxi Driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary, and certainly not favorable to this film (or E.N for that matter). <br /> <br /> And IMHO, is cowardly run in the end. Cheap Emotional Tricks for Teen Lovers Somewhere in Central America. This guy should have killed the boy, blamed his father, create a real destruction. Or the child should have killed the father in the end, etc., but no, we have reached a rough end, where the children miss the crazy, the father is intrigued by their own life and the relationship with them and the crazy, of course , passes away. The happy dysfunctional family remains unharmed, safe and happy, bored again, so that we could enjoy our imperturbable corn. <br /> <br /> And that scene where the madman enters the movie, oh my God, I would have to think long and hard to find something more stupid than that! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. The creators of this movie probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you're a 16 year old girl somewhere in Kansas or anywhere and you dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age, OK, so you can enjoy this movie and your "message."
