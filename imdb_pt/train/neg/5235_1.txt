I can only understand why some people might want to emphasize the connection of this movie to the 80s, but I really would not say it is an accurate description of most people's lives back then - even in Bradford's poorest properties. However, it is typical of the troubled garbage of agitprop the old and beloved Royal Court Theater was brewing at that time. Lots of 'right' art for small and small audiences, but connected enough to secure future commissions for turgid games. The simple fact is that if you want to reflect on a truer common experience, you will find millions of people agreeing to agree to love and live as described in "The Girl of Gregory." <br /> <br /> I would be tempted to call this kitchen sink drama, but that would be harming the plumbing industry a lot. However, with regard to a decent script, this film is in fact all washed. For some reason, he has accumulated an unparalleled number of followers among the Guardians who read the movies - I can only assume they have a visual frisson by pretending to. Avoid my friends. It's a poor movie with a poor script that likes to think it's breaking the limits, adding humorous insights into the dark lives of the properties. it's not ... but it's bleak. Do the washing instead.
