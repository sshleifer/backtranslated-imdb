Ram Gopal Verma proved to be a very innovative and competent director. He had done a remake of Godfather with Sarkar, and had tremendous success. The same goes for Lolita, who did as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay is the movie he says over and over that inspired him the most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing and boring remake. <br /> <br /> The acting ranged from decent to very good, with Amitabh Bachchan being suitably menacing as the Babban villain. <br /> <br /> The songs were terrible and forgettable. The song Mehbooba Mehbooba came out as a second-class video. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the rhythm and the dialogues - which were forgettable. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie in a theater, I found myself waiting for the break and then the end. Some viewers were wise in not waiting, and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film. Ultimately, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Verma.
