Wimpy-stuffed Armand Louque (brutally played by veteran actor Dean Jagger in a rare lead role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies. Armand falls in love with the lovely Claire Duval (who seeks blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses the sap to get Armand's colleague, Clifford Grayson (the hopelessly wooden Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious at being used and despised by Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge. Does it sound exciting? Well, it certainly is not. To begin with, Victor Halperin's static (not) direction allows the tortuous, monotonous story of the conversation to proceed at an extremely slow pace. Worse still, Halperin fails crucially in bringing any tension, atmosphere and momentum into the horribly tedious process. Most blah who works from a largely insipid cast does not help at all; only George Cleveland, like generous General Duval and E. Alyn Warren, as the irascible dr. Trevissant, manages to liven things up a bit with his welcome and refreshing histrionics. The film library soundtrack, painfully obvious stage sets, and gross cinematography are also lousy and unimpressive. In fact, this faint excuse for a frightening feature is so insignificant that not even the unimpressive, unbelievable eyes of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate the numbing boredom of the brain. An annoying failure.
