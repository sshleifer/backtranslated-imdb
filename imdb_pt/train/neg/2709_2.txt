The only way to get something out of this movie is to approach it as a comedy. Seen in this light, he delivers. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a superficial and one-dimensional examination of "questions" without any insight. <br /> <br /> Make a movie about stereotypes and then make each character in your movie a stereotype. is an extremely poor strategy - especially when these same characters just break their banal molds in predictable and stereotyped ways. Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost watchable, and Michael Rappaport turns into a good performance, but the script is so horrible and the social commentary is so banal, it's hard to find something that redeems it .
