Watching a videotaped replay of about eight Spider-Man cartoons from 1994-1997 made me realize why I did not put up with it when I first went out. <br /> <br /> I'm from old school, where the 1967 movie The Spider-Man cartoon was the best and remains the best. (I will not go into the psychedelic version which is terrible - give me traditional villains, please.) <br /> <br /> The acting on the new material sucks, read a sheet with no feeling or exaggeration. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best dubbing for Spider-Man. No one comes close. Watching Secret Wars, a great idea for a cartoon mini-series, made me shudder. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has no German accent, while Ock is heavy Russian! The old series of heroes of the Marvel comic strip of 1966 had a much better voice performance. The Iron Man appeared to be wearing an iron mask, Captain America sounded authoritarian not as a teenager. Paul Frees as The Thing in the '60s was the best thing of all. Old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be someone like them. Have you ever heard Mel Blanc's son? No way he can replicate his father. <br /> <br /> The animation is awkward. Ok, so they have all the shades of sophisticated characters and well painted backrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movement sounds bad. Sometimes, when you let the computer take over the movements, it becomes robotic. I really do not think any of these animators know what's between the interlocutors. <br /> <br /> Stories are poorly written, and some of the lines they give to heroes are horrible. Why, for example, when the heroes first come together, do they start fighting each other? In the Secret Wars, it was a tattered excuse that put them at odds. I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher, but why the Thing and the Iron Man can not control each other is ridiculous, so the Torch unites. This is just one more of the later comics. tendencies to make heroes come together for a few seconds because "everyone" wants to see these things. Give them a better reason to fight and maybe it's possible, but "Hey, what are you doing here" and "You do not tell me what to do" are LAME's reasons. Another poorly written scene is in The Wedding, where Harry Osborne unmasks to ruin Peter's marriage. This whole scenario was horrible. <br /> <br /> Last but certainly not least, is what another critic calls Juvenile Violence - that is, no punches at all. In the Secret Wars, the Lizard carefully dodged the burden of Thing. But the Thing knocks out thugs in a whole block in the comics. He should simply go back to lifting heavy things and subduing a bad guy by grabbing him in the cartoons. Of course, these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults, but for children under 12 years. That's why they can not have punches, because Mom and Dad do not believe in this type of violence. But you can blow things up, those drawings will include that. As a child, before political correctness came into fashion, I saw cartoons pounding. What's wrong with a chop punch? Is there really less violence in the world today because these new, cunning cartoons took the blow? I find that the most insulting of all when I see new things. They wrote "the punch" because we could all get hurt. <br /> <br /> Kids, enjoy these cartoons all you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br />
