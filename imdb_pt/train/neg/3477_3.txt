Not as bad as you've heard. In fact, there are some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is attractive and sympathetic as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are accomplished professionals. They are very good at almost everything. In the end, "Surviving" is not the worst vacation movie you'll see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is out of focus and much of the comedy is forced. Attempts of dark humor are bleak. Affleck goes a long way to being captivating and overly enthusiastic, but seems disturbed. His character's caricatured nature is brought in high relief when viewed alongside the softer and more convincing performances of Gandolfini and O'Hara. Even with the relaxed standards of the year-end movies, you never completely buy the Affleck setup by "renting" that family for Christmas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that border the surreal in their strangeness. . The Christmas Eve scene filled with incestuous humor (a son being discovered looking at nude and provocative pictures of his mother) which is not only not funny or believable but disturbing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the colors of this film are muddy, almost noxious. The house in which most of the film goes seems fucking and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Surviving" is mainly of interest as the fourth in a series of box office failures (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and that) for Affleck. It remains to see how long the damage will be.
