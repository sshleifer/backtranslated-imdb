This movie was crap with a capital "C." The opening scene showed promise. But this "promise" was broken shortly after the viewer found out where the plot is going. <br /> <br /> And the wooden statue, Morty, which was pretty scary in the original movie, looks like a fool in this movie. He was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume. (And by the way, who else thinks "Morty" is one of the most amazing names on Earth?) He's way above "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to horror value. Henry-freakin-Kissinger "Run, it's Dr. Kissinger!" That would be as scary as "Morty." And then there's a scene where the "hero" arrives at the tombstone of your father with a "sledgehammer?", you can imagine - "one of two by four?", someone might venture in. No, he bangs furiously on his father's tombstone with a twig - a damn branch. There's also a Native American who lives with the grandmas of the main character but apparently does nothing but Perpetual Morty-scary legends, warns those who mock, and even repairs Morty's arm when he is damaged during a child's play But in spite of all the res chest and tenderness by Morty, Morty gives a hairy stick back? No. <br /> <br /> The film trails and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (more or less). This movie is a real yawn. Do not rent.
