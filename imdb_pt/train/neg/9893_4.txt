I only hope that no classicist / historian of antiquity has seen "Cleopatra" or, if she did, she has taken it as a laugh. The film is terribly inaccurate, even more risible, than "Gladiator" (which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulated and correspond well to the story). The most egregious is Octavian, Caesar's heir, in the Senate before Caesar's murder: at the ripe age of 19! <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a touch of James Bond when he says, "Caesar, Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a laughably dense Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tries her best to be the seductive pharaoh (which in real life was not pretty at all), but it seems unbelievable. <br /> <br /> So, this is a warning to all historians - this movie is not true for life!
