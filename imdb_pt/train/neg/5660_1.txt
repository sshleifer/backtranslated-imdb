I'm happy to read so many negative comments about Tritter's plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They like the rude nature of House and her intelligence, but really do not like the revenge of this continuous plot. This cuts across the real nature of the hospital's history and makes everyone angry with police authority. You need to take a more careful nature instead of revenge for everyone in the hospital. In addition, there seem to be many questionable legal aspects about what Tritter is actually doing. He alone can not freeze accounts and have the authority to prevent doctors from writing patient prescriptions. A lot of revenge he is showing is also hurting very sick patients in the hospital and not a good plot to portray. I voted the horrible episode not because of the story itself, but when you insert the Trittor piece, it discourages me and the rest of the plot is harmed by this, people say they hate watching the story lines more. Please change. Take the Tritter.
