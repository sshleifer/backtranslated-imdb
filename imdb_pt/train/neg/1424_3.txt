The film has a good start portraying an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and introduces two very friendly side characters during the first time. But later something happens and suddenly Shannon turns into this bad girl of second hand and the film is lost in its own context. The second half does not have any kind of charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad performances, a horrible plot and even worse coordination. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the Chechen mafia gang. "Game of Death 2" was evil and clownified Bruce, but his top daughter makes an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the couple who played Bruce Lee at that time. I truly believe she can do much better than that and hopefully she will participate in a better production next time. <br /> <br /> If you're a hardcore action fan and do not care about quality, go ahead and watch this movie. I was personally looking forward to it, but was terribly disappointed.
