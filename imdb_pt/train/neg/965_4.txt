First I liked this movie. It seemed like a good comedy with some silly moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best !!! Same as wonderful scenery decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a really good taste !!! But the writers have disappointed me greatly. The best ending would be the scene on the stairs, but instead they decided that the father and daughter should be together. Do not like the ending. The father becomes the boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex-wife knows it and finds it all right. Okay, if the writers, for example, say that there is a different soul in the body now, but they did not, they just deprived him of memories. The actors were good, they were very funny. Cybill Shepherd was charming, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny on the dance scene :))) ... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years (it's a long time!), She was faithful to him, she loved no one besides him, and when she met him and it was just about making love to him, after a scene with his friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), she very easily betrayed the man she craved for so many years !!! It would be a good movie, if not the end and some lack of human psychology.
