This mini-series is actually more fun than others with much bigger budgets and more grandiose aspirations. SOTD falls somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" in the entertainment spectrum. If it was not so long (almost 3 hours), I think kids would love it. It has adventure, action, "cliffhanger scenes", and not much romance or other icky stuff. When you are young, you are not very critical in flexing rubber swords, overdrive and repeated scenes. (At least two scenes are repeated identically in the film, as was done in the old sitcoms in order to bring the audience to speed.) Finally, children generally accept the American English dialogue coming out of the mouth of Asia . actors (Not to mention the fact that several of the major roles are played by non-Asian actors.) I was going to give this film three stars, but I felt like the director, producers and cast deserved some extra credit to at least carry out the project. This film is not art but, as painting your home actually took some time, effort and discipline to do so. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is not a recommended use for your time, but you can keep the kids having fun while traveling in the mini van. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes ... hey, IMDb! "Dialogue" is the preferred and traditional spelling. Your spelling check seems to think that "dialogue" is the correct spelling. While the "dialogue" is acceptable, both Webster and OED consider it an alternative form.
