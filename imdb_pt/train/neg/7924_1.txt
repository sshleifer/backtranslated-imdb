Ted V. Mikels' film, Cadaver Corpse 2, is 103 minutes from an excruciating cinematic experience. The plot is practically a mixture of nonsense business among people who grind corpses into cat food while aliens, who are losing a war with alien dogs, seeking to get some of this cat food. Watching this movie, I started looking for any kind of distraction, anything to make sure I was doing something other than losing my head from the inside out. <br /> <br /> Several scenes last a long time, as characters take too long to do simple things. I have heard that Mr. Mikels does not like to use jumps very often, for fear of confusing the audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is "avant-garde" or just "stupid". As much as I tried, I could not worry about any of the characters in the unnecessarily large cast, as well as the possible exception of the old guardians of the factory. Most of the cast is a bunch of talented amateurs who do not even bother to learn the lyrics to "Amazing Grace" before they have to sing on camera. Although maybe the guilt should go to poor sound quality, since I only heard about 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD. <br /> <br /> This is possibly the worst movie to be filmed. I listened to excerpts from the comment, and Mr. Mikels appears as a surprisingly sweet man, what the hell was he doing doing that kind of crap? I would like to hear the explanations of the old men who had to lie down shirtless on a metal mat waiting to be buried. Movies that I hated suddenly seem much better. I long for Excalibur's intermittently appropriate music and the consistent lighting of Dawn of the Dead. I need to go do something, anything. I do not see this movie.
