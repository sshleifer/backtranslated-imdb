So that was an HBO "Made for TV Movie" eh? Is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting? It's a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to such a repetitive role (shot, survived, liar, beaten, survived, shot, liar and ad infinitum.) As for the British, embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton pathetic (or he was just taking op ***, depends on how much it was paid, I guess?) a Southern Sheriff's attempt). As for that other Briton, the bleached blonde, what a whore! There is a tendency to glorify these super-violent thugs lately, perhaps thanks to the two Madonna films, which can entertain and justify violence by the skillful use of irony and humor as Pulp Fiction does. However, this film discredits and devalues ​​the genre. Definitely one to miss.
