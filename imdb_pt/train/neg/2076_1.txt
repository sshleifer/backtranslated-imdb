Well, I must say this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The jokes were extremely rude (I was not expecting like the PG movie) (Rated PG in Canada) and they were not funny! With this great cast I at least expected some good acting, but I did not even get it. I'm a big fan of Rainn Wilson and this is the first time I've been extremely disappointed with his performance. Not even the characters of Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman are anything but nice and I really could have cared less about what happened to either of them. I did not expect this at all as in the past I really enjoyed other films from this director (Six Days, Seven Nights, for example) This movie was not worth the $ 10 it cost me and I strongly recommend that you do not watch this movie. I guarantee you'll be like me begging for this movie to end.
