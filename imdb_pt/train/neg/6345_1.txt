this film is just an excuse for the writer to make a film with 2 failed scripts. <br /> <br /> Their characters are just a montage of characters with tragic or comic cliches, whose sum total is a neurotic dialogue as only Woody Allen could write. woman love it because it's like looking in the mirror so they can enjoy this movie probably <br /> <br /> this movie was not appreciated by me however because there was no car chase and also the film had no fight. there were no traffickers or bandits either. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This movie had no snakes. Not my cup of tea, and maybe not his ether, so think about what I said before seeing yourself watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Unless you look like a woman who has weight problems. and mcbeal ally so this is significant to you.
