I really liked Bilal's graphic novel when he left, and I was impressed when I saw the trailer for this movie, and even more so when I discovered that Bilal had directed himself. The film, however, was a big disappointment. The visuals are nowhere near the rich, sandy texture of the original works of art, and the story is barely told. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he also does not do a good job at it. <br /> <br /> The nicest part of the original graphic novel was: the relationship of friendship and hatred between Nikopol and Horus. Both were out of their right time and place, forced together by circumstance. Most of all, they were funny and friendly. Not so here. Nikopol has no perceptible personality, and Horus is a pompous one who only wants to have sex. Even if the movie is French, Horus does not have to be! <br /> <br /> We all saw movies that we liked but would not recommend at all for some reason. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone except perhaps as a warning not to exceed their talent and resources. Bilal is a master storyteller, but obviously not a master of all visual means.
