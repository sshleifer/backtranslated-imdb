Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. You can say that she is just "acting". I like Izzard though. The plot is terribly annoying. The viewer has no real connections to the characters, never knowing who to really sympathize with or care about. Slow and bland movie, with a few laughs, but few and not very funny anyway. The plot is not engaging or suspenseful at the very least. You can see every curve of the plot coming up a mile away. What should this movie be? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You're not going until the end of this movie.
