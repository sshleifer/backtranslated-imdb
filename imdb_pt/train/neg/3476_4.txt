I liked it, I really liked it. Please do not think I'm an idiot, but I have to admit that I liked this movie. I expected it to be crap, it was crap, but sometimes it's OK to relax and watch a low-quality movie so you do not have to focus too much, do you? I did not expect any occult or moral meanings, and there were none, but it did not matter, because I only watched for entertainment, and it entertained me everywhere. Films like that are why Ben Stillers (apologizing 'there's something about Mary') and Vince Vaughns (however, you spell his surname, I could not be bothered checking) have jobs. It's okay to watch a bad movie, as long as you do not expect too much from it, and I, for example, will stand, run, run, but not drive because I have no car, for Blockbuster Video, or even Choices, and we rented a lot of these toiletries and stayed in one night watching them. Good morning to you reader. Q. If you do not say that this comment has helped you, then I do not like you, if you say it helped then God bless you, you will go to heaven.
