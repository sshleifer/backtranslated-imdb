I watched the first 15 minutes, thinking it was a real documentary (with an incredibly dramatic "on camera" producer). <br /> <br /> When I realized that everything was staged, I thought "why would I want to waste my time watching this crap?" So I hung up and called to tell other people. The characters do not act convincingly. lots of immature emotion. for a guy traveling half the world in a war-torn country, he acted like a child. and I can not believe it was because "his character was so upset about the mall bombings." <br /> <br /> Very banal and stupid. <br /> <br /> You've seen "the city of the lost." children "? French black fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I liked it!
