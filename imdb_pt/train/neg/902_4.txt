I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was one of the first films of Sophia Loren. She was 19 when the film was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to see some of the early works of Sophia Loren. I was surprised when she came on camera taking her tan skin in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Certainly, today, this would have been seen as an insult and to be avoided in the movies. In fact, it became annoying to watch Mrs. Loren in skin-colored paint throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would have been better done if the actual opera singers had made this movie. Then the actual singing and facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent. I disregard other people's comments on whether the real opera singers are older and heavier. As beautiful as Mrs. Loren at age 19 and still today, the film would have been better received even though it was being performed onstage. After all, we do not see gorgeous young people on stage with opera singers singing behind the curtain! Do not give up on the success of using heavy opera singers. Suffice it to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company, with opera singers onstage singing so professionally praising the company's product. This is one of the best and fun TV commercials produced to date. <br /> <br /> The quality of the print of the film also makes this production have a slightly lower quality. The colored ink faded a lot and this can not be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this DVD movie, the producer must add subtitles in English so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the lyrics are saying. It would help the story and teach more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie not because of Aida's story or the fact that it is an opera. In addition to Sophia Loren, none of her co-actors is known or remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Mrs. Loren and would like to see her at age 19 - no matter what the production is. Larry from Illinois
