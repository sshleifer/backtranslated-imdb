In my opinion, this movie does not advance in new thoughts. It seems to me like having a spear to a spear without looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I think your rational is missing, there does not seem to be room for alternative vision. I, at least, am usually on the side of the opponent, but this film lacks credibility as it is based on the fantastic remarks of the man / woman on the street. actually now, if you want to create a credible alternative to a creed maintained for over 2000 years, you have to make a greater effort to allow the other side to express your beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the movie it seemed like an attack on the Christian faith. I, for example, am a non-believer, but I impart the beliefs of others, and I do not want to ridicule them, but try to understand and tolerate them.
