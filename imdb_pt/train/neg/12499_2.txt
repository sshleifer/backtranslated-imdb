I went to the film as a premiere in Austria. So I had no idea what I'm going to see. The story is very normal. The film is very long, I believe it could have halved without causing problems to the story. It's the kind of movie you can see on a boring night that you want to get bored more! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is fine. The film talks about the US Coast Guard, how they are trained, their lifestyle, and the issues they face. As there is not much effect in the movie. So if you want to watch then there is no need to waste your money and time going to the movies. It would be more effective to watch at home when it comes to DVDs.
