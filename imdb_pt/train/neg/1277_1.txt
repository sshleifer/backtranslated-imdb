This movie still chills me to the bone thinking about it. This movie was not only bad like low budget, poorly acted, etc., although it certainly was all these things. The problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer and do it with great success. What I want to know is, is this supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely horrible, but not the way horror movies should be. I could see the first thread trying to be hideous and failing, but what the heck is the second thread? It's just annoying. The third segment is like watching an arts student film, which surprisingly makes it the least painful segment. It's an atrocity that this movie is not so low on 100, so take your votes (1/10) in people !! I know some people gave such good reviews, but, well, they're lying in a sadistic attempt to fool you. Trust me, it's impossible to like this movie. The only benefit of this movie is an incredible life-prolonging effect: it seems like you've watched this movie for years, after only the first half hour has passed.
