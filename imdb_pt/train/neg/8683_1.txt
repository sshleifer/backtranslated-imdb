This show is not smart. This is basically what it boils down to. The "original humor" these writers try to extract in order to avoid biting the rest of the world is a bland thing to do. In another comment, someone cites some hilarious lines. The highlight for me was George H. W. Bush telling the kids they should not watch any TV other than Fox News. Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. The fact that this line is a high point for the series is pathetic. <br /> <br /> My problem with nonsense like this sad excuse for political satire is that these people are winning a second season. I am a liberal republican and I know that Bush has not been a good president. We all do. But that's no excuse to end this wasted time. I put these writers on the same level as the geniuses behind 'Meet the Spartans'. Their formula, morgue out as many topical jokes already unfunny as you can and throw in even worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit. <br /> <br /> Once again, just plain bad. Bland, and it makes me more and more unhappy that this crap is renewed, but incredible and original programs like Arrested Development are canned after 3 solid seasons. Please do not watch this crap, unless you're one of those liberal green-blooded hippies who think any phrase with the words Bush and Dumb is comic gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Bush's voice sucks. All he does is imitate a Texan accent and exhale quite at the end of his sentences. At least South Park admits that voices are not accurate. If you want funny political satire, watch Daily Show / Colbert. Or look for any political outline on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, since the stop motion action animation is EXTREMELY well done. Look for George Bush as a Jedi on youtube. Priceless
