I must agree with the first comment: this movie sucks, very difficult. Despite having a very large cast on B-list, the cover of this film (for those who are not watching Comedy Central for a weekday, which is probably the only exposure this movie will have) tries to blame Dangerfield, but it's actually just a paycheck for all the comedians of the '80s. Randy Quaid? Checks. Ed Begley, Jr? Checks. The voice of Lisa Simpson? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive was not her only horrible movie: check it again. And many, many others. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about this movie is that it has been so lazily written with jokes already told. Nothing about this movie out of its existence is funny. You better watch dry paint. This is definitely a direct video video that still believes the old video adage: throw an old star on the cover and you'll have some money back from the rent. . Considering that video rental days are changing, consider this one of the last examples of putting trash. <br /> <br /> The only use of this movie is if you are having trouble falling asleep. This will get you there.
