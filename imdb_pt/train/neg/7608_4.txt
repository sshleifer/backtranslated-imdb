I admit I do not expect much from a Roger Corman movie. Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. However, in this case, I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the brave Beverly Garland) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. Garland is a great marksman, killing one of the killers the next day at her husband's funeral. Your first task is to close the local bar that is violating the curfew of the city. The bar owner is trying to buy land before being bought by the (expected) railroad. However, Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar's midwife hires a man to kill Mrs. Garland. <br /> <br /> Because Mrs. Garland plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation. to go to Suzanne Somers "She's the sheriff" jokes. With the exception of a couple of faux pas (the apartment door that opens out from the interior, the jeep tracks and the two riders waiting on the screen for a walk around the corner), the film becomes quite acceptable as movie passing. However, Corman could not resist padding his film with scenes of horseback riding, just as he does in other films. <br /> <br /> Sterno says that The Gunslinger is an opera that is worth its time.
