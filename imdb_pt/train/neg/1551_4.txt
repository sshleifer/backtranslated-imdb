The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There is not much to think about this, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? In fact, it's better than most SNL movies (ie, Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funniest in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is medium and is only there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funniest movies, but I've seen the dumbest ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skittle though. But still, if you are looking for a very funny movie, I highly recommend this. Just do not think too much about it, or you'll hate it. Rating: 6/10
