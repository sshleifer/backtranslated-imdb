If you're going to try to create tension in a movie, it's always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Butchers still do not understand that. This movie sucks, unlike most of their characters (if you did not work out, they're vampires in the first few minutes, so embarrass you) preferring to tie the abundant supply of 'no one knows where I am kind of cheerleaders and gay homosexuals who float conveniently and with an arrogance of fast food, passing through the isolated door. <br /> <br /> The only bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires become vampires at first. place, but the rest is ridiculous and sloppy. <br /> <br /> Forced to climb poles (such as opposition stakes) on a regular basis, due to their propensity to fill their basement with bloodless corpses, they really are not very bright. If they fed their victims, they could run their own little blood farm and this would reduce the death rate, allowing them to calm down and get flushed. <br /> <br /> Why the producers found it necessary to introduce incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother I'm not sure. It added zero to the plot, which was a shame, since there was not much plot to start and had no shock value. <br /> <br /> It was never said why the parents had died, unless, of course, it was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. Clearly, the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other, but again, it was for the viewer to write their own reason. <br /> <br /> The only well-rounded character was the younger brother who emerged looking like Pugsley from the Adams Family. In fact, he was very rounded, having the appearance of a child who inadvertently wandered from a Weight Watchers class to a very bad horror movie. Oh heavens, he had. Never mind, honey, eat another donut with a delicious center of blood.
