This movie is about British WWII prisoners of war escaping from a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I find "The Wood Horse" disappointingly boring. The subject could have been thrilling, full of suspense and full of adrenaline, but "The Wooden Horse" is told in a very simple way. It is a collection of simple events and badly told, without suspension and emotion. The first half clearly says how prisoners of war have dug a tunnel, but the events are so clear, without enough errors and shallow beard to push me to the limit. The last half of the movie is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. And the characters could talk a little less and take more action in an action movie! I'm disappointed with "The Wooden Horse," which wasted the potential to be a great movie.
