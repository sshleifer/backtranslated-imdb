That's the question you should ask yourself when you watch this movie, "What was the point?" This movie did not go beyond an hour and a half of confusion with completely unpleasant people (not going to use the word actors) and a script that you could say existed. <br /> <br /> One of the things that made me laugh more about this movie was how it said "Victorian history written by" meaning that there was actually a road map for that part of the story. The whole Victorian section had no dialogue, and was composed only of photos of a guy looking at a girl and vice versa. Make that part of the movie scripted like a camera left at a train station. <br /> <br /> Okay, time of the story. It starts with a guy sitting in a chair that never comes out of it. Oh lock, who needs you? These journalists go to his house and practically beg him to tell this story about these dead girls. So he starts the story in Victorian times. (girl looks at the face) (face looks at the girl) cuts to the movie. That's pretty much all that happens for about half the movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is an incredibly strange dialogue about a lot of models who want to buy an apartment. So this realtor shows them one and when I say that the dialogue is strange I mean, if it was a dancer he would stumble during MACARENA. None of the characters in this movie are friendly. The models are incredibly annoying, the Victorian people do not talk, and the guy who tells the story has the personality of a sack of onions. Then, eventually, all the girls are dead. and dead, I mean drug off-screen. ooh did you show a death? and by death do I mean holding your face until they put on the blood makeup? incredible. <br /> <br /> How this guy knows that story puzzles me. He says it's because he saw it. but how? there was no face in that apartment! the door was locked with no way out, the windows were attached to a fire escape that was too rotten to work, how did HELL see all that? Oh plot holes. we love you. So the movie ends with the new voice saying "I think you invented it. You're wasting our time" despite the fact that she begged for the interview in the first place. Whatever. This movie was stupid, meaningless, and did not make sense with many holes in the plot. I could keep talking about this movie, but I do not see the need. I'd rather spend my time doing something useful. Like something wrong. "Threshold of Hell" belongs more to purgatory with 2 mute models. of 10.
