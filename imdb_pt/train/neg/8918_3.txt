... luckily he still has not! This is a crude and simplistic student policy turned into drama. It requires the viewer to buy a series of concepts. Conceição 1: That a British electorate could be swayed from being basically correct to being extremely left. Conceição 2: That the whole debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the only critics of the new prime minister are sinister civil servants, MI5, big companies and the Americans (of course). Conception 3: That this radical socialist PM can solve all trade union, economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation. Conceição 4: Cutting all ties with the US and NATO is a good thing. Conceit 5: That the Soviet Union is not a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had moments closer to them in the 1980s. And, finally, Conceição 6: That US reactionary forces would actively seek to launch a coup d'etat against Great Britain. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous and the show earned the reputation of trying to make money. in some anti-Thatcher sentiment in the country and having left TV critics singing their praises. When it was made, television was still a very popular and influential medium, with shows receiving huge ratings, so a widely spoken drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of reaching a large audience. Ray McInally's performance was great, which is one of the few good points. History and time have shown the enormous weakness in the premise and the plot of this spectacle.
