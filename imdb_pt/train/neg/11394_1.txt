Oh, for crying aloud, this has to be the most LAMEST movie I've seen all year, and I'm sorry that the normally amazing John Cusack was involved in this stupid piece of stupidity. Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what appears to be the same message, although on a more subtle, somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer, and then starts pounding it in his psyche for the next and boring hour and sock. (and this is an hour and a half of my life I will never go back again, thank you !!). It's bad enough that the main characters in this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds (actually I know fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Piven, which was quite amusing. Only the first 15 minutes of the movie in which Kate Beckinsale's character interprets this annoying nonsense of a game about playing all wind sensitivity (literally) made my best friend and I irritate beyond belief. I told my husband that Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least the Rockstar characters were not as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this "Serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to watch the protagonists who seem to have no idea of ​​the choice in their lives, and feel that they are nothing but puppets to the fate and whims of fate. How tiring. I am sure that this film will most likely be appreciated by those who prefer not to engage in the chaotic mess of making more complex life choices and then living responsibly with the consequences. After all, here is a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after they wreak havoc and misery on other people's lives (ie their respective brides), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there. <br /> <br />
