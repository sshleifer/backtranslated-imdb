This is really a very bad movie. The ideology is not as perverse as in the films Collins did later. However, my main doubts about the film are that it is implausible and frankly annoying for a long time. The whole concept of a former SAS member joining terrorists for no particular reason is not very convincing and you can not help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become very ignorant) fall in love by him. The film begins with a very powerful scene, but then it spends a lot of time towards the grand finale. Overall, I think Who Dares to win could have been an interesting 45-minute episode of The Professionals, but the story does not feature a feature film. Although reasonably successful at the time, the film began the end of Collins's career, which in the 1980s made mostly movies of cheap and dubious soldiers and soldiers. Too bad because he is a very versatile actor but at the end of the day Martin Shaw has chosen his roles more carefully and has a career that is still successful.
