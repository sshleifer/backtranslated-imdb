Six different couples. Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Eighty numbers of audience in the cinema. Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> I'm sitting somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All stories have no links to each other, but somewhere below the Nikhil Advani line trying to show some relationship between them. I tried to figure out some lines that I could write as a review, but at the end of 3 hours and 15 minutes I did not find anything to write. The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE REALLY. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch the movie if you really want to watch a good movie.
