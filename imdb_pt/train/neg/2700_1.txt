Despite, or perhaps in part due to the clever use of music to highlight the motivations and ideologies of each of the main characters, stereotypes are present, and verisimilitude and characterization are outside of this subtle cinematic argumentation. One has the impression that John Singleton was becoming interested in post-structuralist literary theory because it was the taste of the day, and "Higher Education" was the biased outcome. The low point of the film is "peace," in which the symbols of the "free love" movement of the 1960s are reappropriated to something much more like a "Take Back The Night" demonstration with strident musical acts and identity identity. in tow. Perhaps in his main revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new Vietnam? Oh, how Adrienne Rich of him and Remy throwing in the crowd is a nice touch if you like the kind of political stance of Rich. I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can only recommend it to those interested in the 1990s as history, a time when radical feminists brought the trinitarian academic culture of race, class, and gender into popular culture and declared hatred of man "a viable and honorable policy option ". Where is Camille Paglia when you need it?
