Disgusting. I found it odd that their old book on curses was done using a common script font instead of handwriting. The acting is so apathetic at times and so dramatic at other times. Why would a "demonic" person kill the two suspicious and quiet physicians who helped make him immortal? Just for the hell of it? And it really is necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle whenever she is somewhere. We understand! You spent a little money to rent a third-category groin rocket. That does not mean you have to show it all the time! The "Faith" lair looks like an old Battlestar Galactica school with some last minute changes. There is a scene where we are introduced to some people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before being killed for no apparent and unimportant reason. Everyone is a disposable character. Unforgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived films I've ever seen on the SciFi channel. Stay away unless you're in bad movies.
