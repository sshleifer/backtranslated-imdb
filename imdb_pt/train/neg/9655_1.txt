I ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the comments, at the request of a woman. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who really recommend others to watch this movie. I am very shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this site that makes me conclude that it is a scam. As far as my opinion goes, I have to ask, "Are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that viewers are retarded?" The film is atrocious on so many levels and I'm not even talking about history or presentation. <br /> <br /> So, these guys and one more girl (the lead actress) form a band; Guessing the constant presence of guitars is supposed to be a ROCK band. Hell, when did the dancers begin to become part of a rock band? Anyway, let me accept you as the Bollywood version of a rock band, but playfully enough of all the scores that really made those two guitarists make all kinds of "ROCK GESTURES" and I'm assuming they were playing instruments, the guitar sound was completely absent !!! I just can not understand the magnitude of stupidity here ... <br /> <br /> I'll just conclude here because it's not worth highlighting any other flaws in the movie. Bollywood directors seem to have no more shame !!!!!!!!
