This film wastes virtually all of an actor's talents on what could be called the charitable "potboiler". <br /> <br /> Despite the opening of action-packed 'Top Gun', everything is difficult, with many stereotypes and unlikely situations. Following each other until you try to choke on your popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are so many dead-end story lines in this movie that I was guessing that at one point it was made by putting together a discarded TV series. eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu The character of Costner is made of wood and does not give us reason to believe that he really fell in love with Mendez's wife. Nor are we convincingly led to believe that the wife is anxious for companionship and will skip the first warm body appearing. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 'B' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved.
