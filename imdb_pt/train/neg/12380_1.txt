The creativity of this film was lost from the beginning, when writers and directors left out a good story, only to replace with horrible special effects. This movie seemed to be focused on fun kids, but I could not even get it. Many small low budget movies have the potential to become great movies, but this film is not close to that. Fortunately, this will be another film easily made and easily forgotten. This movie was probably a chance for the actors to earn a little money until their chance appeared for a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has a bit of respect for the movies should avoid seeing this movie at all costs.
