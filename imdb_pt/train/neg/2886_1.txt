Horrible, horrible, horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie. It's like a low budget made for the Canadian TV movie. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there have been many others out there. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it on the DVD player or VCR. :-) :( :( It's possible to write ten lines The acting was horrible I had absolutely no flow I saw the made for the TV movie on the killer BTK and it was much better (compared to this) I'm certainly not what they intended to produce this film, but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer that they lost by a mile, it seemed to be more of an infomercial for animal rights.
