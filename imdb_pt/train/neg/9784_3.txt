Mind, my friends and I saw the movie based only on the title. It's cute, though obvious in its plot and direction - you know where the movie is going in the first five minutes. My main contention with the plot is that although it remains reasonably consistent, they never explain many of the things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, an overworked mother, a stressed sister ... is a bad family, but apart from the occasional mention of her sister, there is no solution. I was also confused as to the scene with the bottles ... it seemed quite random. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary concern ... children were not bad performers, but the script left a lot to be desired. desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a cute niche movie was left out by a single special effect, blah, a lame script and a plainly obvious plot.
