This is a humble movie. It has no real plot. We are never made aware of motives other than wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors to put on the movie. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then it is being controlled by these three older people. Why are they doing what they are doing? in order to cause fear in other members of the group? I do not know. There is a fog of a smoke machine that runs through the corridors and everyone seems to be afraid of it. Does that do anything? I do not know. There is some nakedness in and of itself. I'm always surprised to see this in such old films. Things have really settled down in this respect these days. Anyway, people run like chickens, ready for the ax. They have no plan; without resources; anything. There are about five silly climaxes in the film. Who are these people and "is" a ghost or demon. What happened to other people? I challenge anyone to tell me this with some confidence. What a mess.
