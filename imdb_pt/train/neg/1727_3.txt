We have a lake. We have a beating animated meteor. We have a dinosaur stop-motion killer with flippers. Okay, so let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the definitive definition of "comic relief." We also have to have a sheriff who does absolutely nothing in this movie and no one listens. Aw crap, we're in the middle of the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! Do not worry, we'll introduce a guy with a mustache, get him to steal a store to indicate that he's a bad guy, so he should show up somewhere near the lake, have him chased by the forest and all this with the one purpose of ending it as a dinosaur snack. This should work. <br /> <br /> A complete and clumsy mess in this movie. Your logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you. The first film to feature Dave Allen as a "stop motion supervisor." After this, he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the mid-1990s when the Band ran out of money to pay, I think. The effects of the dinosaurs are lovely and the whole movie is very funny without wanting to. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing that can be said for him. Good evil? Yes. The hallucinatory logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
