This is the Peter Falk movie. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 when this movie came out; I was already a film expert at the time. Of course neither my parents nor I saw this movie when it came out, but I was passionate about the typeface of their ads and the aura that this was an important movie. Okay, 34 years later I finally saw the movie - never having seen any film directed by Cassavetes before. He's a hack, in general. Zero sense of time, editing. Gena's performance reminds me a lot of Dustin Hoffman's work on "Rain Man": technically on the same level, but entirely on a note. As Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake for this movie. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed at Gena's performance, really everywhere-it seemed more suited to "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not all her fault: she's a basket from the first scene to the last. We never find out why? But Falk's character seems real and runs WONDERFULLY by Falk as a seriously flawed man. <br /> <br /> Scrape at least an hour (a publisher needed!), and this would have been an impressive portrait not of a woman. under the influence, but a simple man, Cro-Magnon, facing a wife who does not work and still can not deal with her three children and her husband's long hours. <br /> <br /> Instead, remember Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby." He would have been a better director if he had cut his own tendency for excess - as he demonstrates extensively with this film. Bob
