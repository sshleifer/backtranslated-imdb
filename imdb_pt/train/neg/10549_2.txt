The film industry is a tricky business - because decisions need to be made and everyone involved also has a private life. This is the original thesis of this fragile attempt to make an "insightful" movie about cinema. And, in fact, there is no better proof of the industry's difficulties than seeing Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell trapped in that inanity. The insight consists of talking heads talking bullshit like "Should I make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self?" "Do the last one, please." Or, "Our relationship is not just professional, it's private too. It's a pretty complex situation to deal with, is not it?" "Yes, you are my dear." Among the insipid dialogues are palm trees, hotel lobbies and American movie posters (no sign of non-American films on the Croisette). Recurring recessions are inevitable, making the 100 minutes of the movie look like ages. Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her own presence on the board.
