This movie is obsolete and missed the mark. It's far away compared to the 89 Batman he tries to copy. That woman singer, her name can not act, and we see why her movie-maker died. Notice how this movie died at the box office no one sees this movie on TV either. My uncle and father were waiting for Batman, and the printing of the films is more like Cop Rock. Not worth rent 3/10
