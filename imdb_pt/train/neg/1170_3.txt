As a fan of Eric Rohmer's studies of the contemporary war between the sexes, I was very anxious to see "The Lady and the Duke" (L'Anglaise et le duc) "how he would treat men and women during a real war, the French Revolution . <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, with every scene projected as a period painting, like a tableaux vivant. <br /> <br /> And I expected a lot to talk, just like Rohmer's style. <br /> <br /> But maybe Rohmer was restrained by basing the script in the writings of a real woman is the reason it seems more like a docudrama version of "The Scarlet Pimpernel." Terrible as the excesses of Robespierre et al. I was humming to myself: "Marat, we are poor / and the poor are still poor", you can also choose a song from "Les Miz". <br /> <br /> I do not was as nice as the central figure has to go back and forth between her ci and his country house to stay ahead of the Revolution. . At one point, your maid says the pantry is empty, but it sure makes a good meal. I simply did not understand it, an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the Revolution continue to shift political focus; I think I should sympathize with their consistency more than their political machinations, as a character in "The Scarlet Pimpernel." Hey, the only reason she did not come home was her disgrace after an affair and a child with the Prince of Wales or somebody. Normally, in a revolutionary period, there is a wave of changes happening in the relationships between men and women, but I did not see any here. I once went to a lecture by Herbert Marcuse which ended with a long Q & A session. the last question, from a much older audience than the rest of us acolytes, hell he had gray hair, was "Why are revolutionaries so dark?" It was a joke and Marcuse did not deign to respond seriously - but it is the only thing of substance that I remember all night. Rohmer demonstrates that counter-revolutionaries are also somber and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 11/8/2002)
