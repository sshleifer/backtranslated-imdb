There are many extremely beautiful people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Maybe this even makes watching worthwhile. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is about to make his mark on the world. He is the son of a wealthy family with a good reputation and is on his way to law school. But, like so many settings, things are not as perfect as they seem. The expectations in this family far outweigh the love. Except for school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks, but is not spelled to the end. Tristan's claustrophobic environment causes him to release himself in extreme ways at the earliest possible opportunity when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach party, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who pulls him into a drug underworld. <br /> <br /> Although technically well done, this film suffers from a dull script and a story that is not very engaging. Also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out of place, such as slow-motion, fast-motion, freeze-frames, and echos. These are the types of effects that a director can normally use to show a character's perspective while using drugs, except that in this case they appear to have been sporadically played at random points in some cheap style attempt. <br /> Despite its relatively unknown cast, performances were good everywhere, especially with regard to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect we will be seeing at least some of these people on bigger and better projects in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course, when mentioning the actors, I must mention their appearance. Based on taste, this movie earns 11. The women in this movie are incredible and almost distract from the boring movie you are watching. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive, but you will have to ask someone to comment on it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not recommend this movie, not to buy, rent, or even see for free. Unfortunately, it is not worth the effort to sit down.
