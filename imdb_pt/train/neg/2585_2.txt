This was the worst movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only does it have almost nothing to do with the other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely nothing funny. <br /> <br /> Girls are cool, but spending time watching a cheap porn movie could be bigger than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very bad sex ad, made for an audience that is no more than 12 years old. <br /> <br /> I've never visited an American college, but I strongly doubt that anyone who did actually could laugh at any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
