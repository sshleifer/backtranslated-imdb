Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she is certainly involved in sexual relations with men. She is still exploring, trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in her, although it seems that at her age she should have a good idea already. (I can not agree, however, to anyone who says that Young is too old for the role.) If she is, we should age so well.) For the most part, this movie has left me cold, though not the worst. the kind you've seen. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut', at least something happens in this.
