I rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully delicious historical piece. What I got was a piece of pure garbage. This movie was confusing in most places, busy almost everywhere and terrible at all points. Mira Sorvino's portrait of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best. Ben Kingsley should have been deprived of his knighthood, even considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should continue to play Petunia Dursley; at least the Harry Potter movies are more fun than this thing they call a play inside a movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematography seems like some college student did a class on Cinematography 101 and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the movie is cut for some kind of effect; The end result, of course, is the cheesiest part of the edit I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost as good as Agis; Too bad he had such a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling gives her best effort as the almost naive lady on hold. In the end, I would really like to Blockbuster Video of those reimbursements. I'm so glad I did not spend 10 bucks watching this theater fiasco. If they have been performing this play Marivaux since the 18th century, it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work. If I was there, they would not hear the joke in the snore. Thank goodness for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can skip the boring or terrible scenes. I guess that means I just watched the beginning and the end!
