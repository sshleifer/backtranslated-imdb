This movie is massively boring and pretentious. There's only one good time when a sailor shaves Mr. Barney (think purple without pretending to be a dinosaur). The music is relentlessly nauseating - it is sad that Bj√∂rk, someone with such inner beauty, has been reduced to pretentious falsehood in his art. The pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem tasteless. mythology and culture are not respected in this film are raised. Not just Japanese culture, but another filmmaker ... (stay tuned) In a perfect moment of "art imitates life" - the ship's crew finds a giant piece of shit. What the audience found in the theater. There are some pieces that are very composed and arty with no heart --- so get ready for spoilers-I'm talking to you MR BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The Emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney, you've been outdone! I saw Jodorowsky's SANTA MOUNTAIN. And his thin and false veil of BS was lifted. You stole your images from your man's style and his WHOLE ART CATALOG. Now that the SACRED MOUNTAIN has been FINALLY RELEASED, let's hope the powers that be in the Art Councils of the world STOP FINANCING! Poor Jodorowsky - lost in a financial battle with the Beatles' lawyer when he is the film's Lennon / McCartney. And BTW as Jodorowsky is the Beatle-YOU ARE THE MONKEES! A cheap cheap and soulless just likes kitsch college freshmen. And BTW I'm a filmmaker. If you're interested in making a real movie, I'll legally fight you in a ring defending Jodorowsky-you, defending the total theft.
