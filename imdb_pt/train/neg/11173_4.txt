If it were not for the bad dialogues and scripts. I mean, the direction was really in touch with the subject. The actors were doing well in bringing their characters to life. But in the end, the thing that was really missing was a solid script to keep all the pieces together. I would highly suggest not watching this. Unless you're an Al Pacino enthusiast like me and can watch everything he's playing. Even though the result lately is pretty bad. That is, after S1m0ne, a second very bad movie for this actor who already knew how to choose roles.
