If it smells like trash and it looks like rubbish, it should be rubbish. This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Tony Scott's poor directing style embarrasses an already uninteresting and slightly false story of the life of Domino Harvey as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems like all the action scenes have been loosely linked by poor plot points and a horrible performance. Keira Knightley gets totally naked in this movie. This is the only and only advantage of this film. If you want to see her naked just advance the movie until about an hour and a half for him and you will catch a lot of nipples. I strongly suggest that no one ever see this movie! </ 3>
