OMG this was the most painful experience of my life watching it. I could even finish what's going on with Nick. Your best thing in teenage Nick is Drake and Josh and this is about to come out of thin air. The children's songs are kind of boring and the kids are too. My little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes in Disney or nick normally, but after finishing watching this show, she said "one of the worst shows I've ever seen being so annoying." My little brother really fell asleep, I envy him. In short, if your 3 year old without brain activity you will enjoy this show, otherwise change the channel now.
