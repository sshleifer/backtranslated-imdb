The back of the DVD box tells Ellen Page co-stars in this movie. She does not appear until two-thirds of the film ends, and then on smaller paper. I do not consider this a supporting role, but rather a "bit" part. In addition, the plot has many inexplicable elements. Some examples are: why does the main character reject his eldest son? Why does your youngest son head to the train? He says it's for a "sucker" bet that does not explain anything. Obviously, the screenwriter does not know the definition of a sucker bet. This movie is not worth the price of rent in my opinion. Save your money and watch it for free on television if you feel it needs to be seen.
