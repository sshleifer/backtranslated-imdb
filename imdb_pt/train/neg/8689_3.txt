The main problem with "Power" is that it also has useless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie. It gets boring after awhile, sitting around waiting for scenes that do not connect to find something that drives the movie. You could probably go through all this like character development, but they are all recycled from previous scenes from the movie, or are simply plain and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to leave any of the supporting flowers. He should have cut some of the characters (hackman, wife) and focused more on the others (Billings). It could have been a great, difficult political thriller instead of a messy mess that loses any message in a sea of ​​bad writing and acting, a fact that surprised me considering the cast. Even Gene Hackman's performance was not even. Denzel Washington is the only real actor of note here. Gere and the others did much better performances elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet needs to return to the ferocious man he did in the seventies (for example, Serpico) and stop trying to recapture his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe." It still has not worked, Sidney, and it probably will never be. let the dramas ensemble for Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
