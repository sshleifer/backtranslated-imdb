Of the many problems with this film, the worst is continuity; and re-edit it on VHS to a college cable channel many years ago, I tried to figure out what exactly went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually built a much longer film and then cut it for a standard theatrical performance. How much longer? to fill all the holes in the plot, we have three more hours of storytelling and character development - especially considering the fact that the movie we have is so slow and takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> This is amazing; What could the Halperins have tried to accomplish here? His previous film, "White Zombie," was a successful attempt to duplicate the first Universal Studios films (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.) and as such was very close to the zombie mythology that Americans would know of popular magazines. <br /> <br /> The zombie revolt, on the contrary, seems to have been intended as an allegory for the politics of modern warfare. This would not only explain the opening and shifting of Dean Jagger's character to a megalomaniac, but also explains why zombies do not do much in the movie, as well as standing still, looking scared and waiting for orders - they're just allegorical soldiers, not the undead cannibals that we all come to love and abhor in zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I'm just like anyone who does not like modern warfare and politics-but I think that movie should be fun first, and then only, maybe, educational. And definitely - a movie about zombies should be about zombies. <br /> <br /> Truly one of the most bizarre movies in Hollywood history, but none that I can recommend, even for historical value.
