The "bubbling" sound effect of the show used to put me to sleep. A very comforting show. I think I might have slept in the parts where there was danger or danger. I had also heard that some shots for a show on sponge divers were made in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I'd say Lloyd Bridges never plunged there. I just remember the program in reruns and although it was never exciting, we invented our own underwater episodes on the lake at my grandmother's house ... imagining the bubbling sounds echoing and narrating our adventures in our heads. I thought 'Flipper' had better underwater action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
