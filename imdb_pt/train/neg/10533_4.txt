This version has changed a bit slowly for my taste and I suppose I have problems with this piece to begin with. But first the film, it is a typical version of a TV piece, which means that it does not have the talent of the original version of the film with William Holden. What could they not afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the film until 1966? So could you give the little sister a line about the Vietnam War protests? Why not 1963 and give you a line on the civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> As for the cast, some make some mistakes. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character, especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin, on the other hand, misses many of the notes. He is credible as an ex-BMOC athlete, but he does not have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I've always found that Brolin looks a bit like a gorilla to get all the women in the city to use it (pardon the pun). Gretchen Moll was lovely, but she seemed a bit too wise for the character she played. She did not project the innocence or ignorance that the character demanded. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But again, Holden was ten years old. Bonnie Bedelia was quite forgetful, since the mother and Mary Steenburgen can not decide if she was interpreting Blanche duBois or Katharine of "The Megera Domada". <br /> <br /> As for Mr. Inge, I have always felt that such stories as that of a young girl choosing a passion for practicality always needed an epilogue. "The Twilight Zone," I believe, offers a likely epilogue to the episode, "Spur of the Moment," where a young Diana Hyland was being pursued by a more bitter Diana Hyland because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run away with a similar face to Hal Carter.
