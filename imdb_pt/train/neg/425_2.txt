I can not believe I'm so angry after seeing this that I'm about to write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney documentary is nothing more than a rewritten Planet Earth. Now I knew it was heralded as "the people who brought the planet Earth," but I had no idea that they would use exactly the same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary miniseries. I just paid $ 8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. It's a disgrace to Disney for not alerting people that there is absolutely nothing original here (except a James Earl Jones narration and 90 seconds of sailboat that I do not believe were on Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> The biggest crime of all is that while Planet Earth uses the tragic history of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney took the story and transformed it -a in family gut. After the disappearance of the male polar bear, they show that their offspring grew significantly a year later, and vomit up a bit of crap about how they are ready to carry their memory, and that earth is indeed a beautiful place after all. No mention of grown pups, imminent deaths due to the same suffering his father suffered, no warning of trouble for future generations, if we do not act together, nothing. Just a montage of things we've seen throughout the movie (and many more times, if you're one of the billions of people who have ever seen Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> I never left the theater feeling this. embarrassed and deceived in my life.
