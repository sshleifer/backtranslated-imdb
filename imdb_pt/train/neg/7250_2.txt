After reading the other reviews for this movie, I'm of the opinion that the markers are probably paid studio sluts, since the movie I saw was absolutely terrible with wood acting, dull scripting and slow and predictable direction, one of the few good points being the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning scenery with breathtaking views and dramatic skies and open prairies, unfortunately when the most memorable thing in a movie is the part presented behind the actors, this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the film, all in all a completely inspiring addition to the western genre, which even with the very reasonable price, can be obtained on DVD is best avoided.
