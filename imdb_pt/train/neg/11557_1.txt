* SOILER * It's fake! The whole thing is a scam! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half-brother or something wants the castle and its title to itself. So he invests this totally complicated and unnecessary SlyoBY-DOO plan to get Alan to commit suicide. Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them. He's not even killing them. He falls asleep and the girl disappears and he thinks he buried them somewhere. If he looked at Evelyn's so-called ghost, he could tell she was wearing gloves! Oh my God, what a waste of time. Do not worry about watching, renting and if you bought and have not watched it, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from the EVELYN NIGHT OUT OF THE GRAVE. I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN.
