I came to NEW PORT SOUTH expecting a surrogate movie about the Columbine school massacre similar to Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT and certainly the synopsis of the TV guide stating that a sociopath student rebels against the system gave me that impression, but that is a very annoying movie where little happens, so consider yourself warned. <br /> <br /> The story is about Maddox, a high school student from Chicago who decides to reverse what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime. The biggest problem is that the character is subscribed and the actor who plays Blake Shields is not able to embellish any script shortcomings. You have the feeling that Maddox should have the bad charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden, but he never appears as anything more than a petulant truculent adolescent and it is impossible to believe that he could muster any disciple. The subtext of you overturning an authoritarian manipulative regime just to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious, which means that NEW PORT SOUTH is a totally unconvincing drama that is not worth going out of your way to see
