Valentine is a horrible movie. That's what I thought: <br /> <br /> Performance: Too bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. The other was not much better. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was fine, but it could have been more developed. This movie had the potential to be a great movie, but failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some of the music was really cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: It's not very original. Does 'Paige Prescott' Name Recognize Prescott? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Do not see Valentine. It's a really stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
