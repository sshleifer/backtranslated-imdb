From time to time comes a movie that knocks me down and reminds me that my liking for movies that I try to watch is not always flawless. I'd usually stay away from things like that, but I was fooled by some complimentary reviews and Rohmer's pedigree. <br /> <br /> There is an initial and intriguing novelty in production, in which Rohmer essentially overlaps the actors with painting. ) back-drops of the revolution was France. This quickly diminishes and becomes as interesting as watching the paint dry in a painting scene by numbers. What we have left is a boring and stuffy movie about aristocrats in eighteenth-century France. Neither character is attractive or nice. The pace is so faint, the dialogue so arduous, and the suspense is clearly a strange concept for Rohmer, who did not care who rolled his head, who was harboring whom, or what the hell the revolution should be. The film would have benefited greatly from some emotional developmental appearances and a soundtrack (there is good classical music used at the end). Despite being so "talismatic," the film touches a lot like a silent movie, and the worst kind of movie, a boring and uninteresting movie about infinitely interesting subjects. Only the most astute French historians will find anything to take away from this film, since the dose seems to paint events known from a new angle (the lady is English and monarchist). Otherwise, avoid this yawner at all costs, unless you are suffering from insomnia (I dozed twice).
