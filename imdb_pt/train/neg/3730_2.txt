First, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic scriptures. There is also nothing wrong with making a film like this to try to present the gospel message. So my scruples about this film are neither in sincerity nor in aspirations. As a Christian, though a millionaire, I believe there will be a great tribulation and I believe that Christ will return as he said. So even if I disagree with this film about the Rapture, that's not why I rate this film so low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me evaluate this film so low is not its sincerity or its message, but instead, the lack of production values, horrible script, mediocre acting and regrettable effects. This movie is on the list with some of the funniest science fiction ingredients of the 1950s. No, this movie is down with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie did not age well and was probably dated when they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> Producers of genre films from the apocalypse might have learned how not to make an end-time movie from that, but they failed. The Left Behind series, the Apocalypse series and the Omega Code series have not been able to learn from this because they dealt with FX issues and the problem of dated appearance, but their scripts are still bad and their acting is wood. <br /> There are great Christian films with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. It surprises me that the MST3K crew has never satirized this one.
