Unhinged follows the typical plot of the 1980s slasher trend. Pretty young girls in danger. I have to give up the film to the filmmaker who used a helicopter for some of the first shots on the road, you really think that for a second there will be quality in production. Watching "Unhinged" was like watching an amateur acting class go through the heat. Some of the more awkward, poorly lit scenes and superlongs are performed with the taste of an overdose of Valium. I wondered why they did not put the cards on the camera so the actresses did not constantly have to change their eyes. The two main girls were obviously chosen for their T & A factor rather than for talent. Laurel Munson as the main chick, Terry, is as exciting as watching paint dry. Two scenes of nudity create a teenage emotion. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy / chilling daughter and mother of the cubs find themselves stuck with competing for Worst Ever Performance. Long pauses, strange expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, everything is there and is a delight to those of us who love bad movies. The scenes suddenly change with long black outs and you can drive a Mack truck. The lightning bolts of cartoons clash with the shots without bothering to show the sky. The shadow of the eighties harms the viewer. But you know, it grew in me. I felt sorry for that. I wanted to hug him, kiss his boo-boos and make him better. The end does not make up for the damage done, but I smiled anyway. I have my own theories about all the "banned" hype and hope that anyone who chooses to see this movie does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise, go ahead.
