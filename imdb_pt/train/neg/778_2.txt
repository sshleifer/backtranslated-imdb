What has Ireland already done to film the distributors that they seek to portray the country so pejorative? This film begins as a playbook for film students on Irish cinematographic cliches: oily priests, spitting before hand shakes, town squares of cattle, pedaling through country fields to the backdrop of anodyne folk music. Quickly, however, it becomes evident that the main theme of the film is the big daddy of Irish cliches - religious conflicts. She is a Protestant woman who wants to decide where her son from a Catholic father is educated, which seems to be a very reasonable desire, though not for the residents of Wexford in the 50's County with whom she has to live. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, she decides to go to Belfast, then to Scotland, where a few more cliches are reaffirmed. While she is there, her father (who looks strangely like George Lucas) and his family at home are subjected to a boycott, which is very unpleasant. I'm not going to give the ending, not because I think people should go see this movie but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we should sympathize with her, but we end up insisting that she earn a living. Villagers are presented as fanatics whose prejudices should be defended, but traumatizing their children seems an inadequate way of doing so. In addition, it assumes onus over which it openly discusses when it tries to draw analogies with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: the woman is told by her lawyer that she "must establish preconditions" for her return. The film is supposedly based on a true story, but its themes have been treated much more imaginatively, and with less recourse to banal cliches in the past.
