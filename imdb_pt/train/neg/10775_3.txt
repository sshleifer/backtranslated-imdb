This movie is horrible! He rivals "Ishtar" in the number of embarrassingly bad times. I would have rated below 3 except for a few funny lines; but overall this movie sucked! Looked like they did it on a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere. Joe Roth should join Elaine May in directing forever!
