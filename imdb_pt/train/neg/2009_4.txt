This is not a bad movie at all. The plot (new house built next door seems to be haunted) is not bad, the weather is scary enough, and the acting is fine. The big problem I had is that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not understand how different she looks with her seemingly new big lips. I kept looking at them. They look so out of place on her face! They make it look completely different (not better). <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim, the architect who draws and puts his heart and soul at home, does a good job. And Lara (as Col) is also very good (but those lips!) As the owner of the next house. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is appropriately wood. The various characters who live in the house were also well. I particularly liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to move into the house. The attempt to involve ourselves in the general vibration of the neighborhood fails, unfortunately, since the other neighbors are not particularly pleasing. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director failed to make the house "haunted" particularly threatening. Other films (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) can achieve this scary feeling, but that does not happen here. The closest is when Col paints a representation of the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that did not work for me is the twist in the story that occurs with Kim the architect. Initially, he seems to be a victim of the house like the others (sucked him dry in inspiration), but then he seems to have joined forces with him in evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, not bad movie for horror fans, if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
