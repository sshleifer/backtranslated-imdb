This was a movie that I could not wait to see! So I finally got it and was disappointed. To begin with, the film has so little said about New York, just a lot of confusing shots of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It really does not focus on the magic of New York. Another thing that changed my mind was the French. movie set within this movie. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French style remake! Anyway, here you will notice elements reminiscent of French films such as long and confusing scenes, little or no conversations and of course everyone is smoking French style! The story follows many lives (many to my liking) and they somehow seem connected in the end. I feel that there was no dedication to the characters as much as in the stories. The film was too short to cover all the happy destinations around the world. So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each. And there you have your 120 minutes! If you like active scene dialogs and stuff, this is not the movie for you! I give 4 just because I love New York and I loved the cast!
