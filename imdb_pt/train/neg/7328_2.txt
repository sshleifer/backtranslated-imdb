I see a lot of people like this movie. For me, this was a movie done correctly when writing 101 and the person failed in class. From the time that Lindsey Price the videomaker shows to the end, the film was very predictable. I kept looking to see if I was going anywhere. <br /> <br /> First we have the young widowed father. Cliche # 1 movies / TV always kill the parent Mom if the child is a girl, or a litter of boys so that the single parent can get fainted about his dead wife and seems completely out of his element take care of the children. Starting from my 3 children to 2 1/2 dads. These movies are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 2 When an aggressive woman has a video camera in her hand, she will play a major role in the film. And always have solutions or even if that person is an airplane head. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If the person in danger is foreign, it must be of Latin origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently, there are no legal and illegal European Latinos, unless there is an element of the IRA involved. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 4 Latino should be highly educated in his native country. In this case, he was a Teacher who made 200 a month. And the highly educated Latino now must act as if he had no brain in his head right now and let the side kick of the head of the air take over. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 5 The crime the person committed was not really a crime but an accident. But because in this case he lost all sense when he crossed the border he now acts like an idiot and now has put his own daughter in danger leading her along on a fruitless mission to the border with the idiot kicking side. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 6 You never run over a bad guy running away from a crime, but a cute little guy. This is because the child's parents have to play a large part of the film, and because the person who accidentally killed the child can have a ridiculous interaction with the parents. <br /> Cliche # 7 Name me a movie where a cop is not the angry vet and they pair up with a rookie. Even if they are homicide detectives who need to be the most experienced police officers in a police force. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind immediately. And the vet, though harsh on the outside, has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 8 Let's gather some unemployed soap stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not get out of a paper bag and when she used to be in One Life To Live like Marty, he rocked from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It's used to make me sick from the sea. She may be anchored on the earth better now, but she still can not act. <br /> <br /> The film could have been more insightful if it were not full of clichés. I do not think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But that was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I will not ruin the ending. Oh, the hell I will, because I feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time, they will never go back to look at this movie. It involves Cliche # 6 and # 7. Unless a person has never seen a movie before you have to see what was to come. The father even makes a stupid police mistake at the end and is shot by the angry veteran, who is suddenly very upset. You'd think she thought the poor boy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake. When she did not. Now for the little girl that her father brought with him. Guess what happened to her? The time has come, she ends up living with the family whose son was killed by her father !! Let's go! You all knew this was going to happen, because she's a surrogate child !! That's why she did not move in with the Lindey Price character. <br /> <br /> This movie was an insult as far as I was concerned. Because there were so many avenues that this movie could explore and came down, but chose to take the one cliché. The 2 stars are for 2 of the stars, the girl, which I thought was very good and Lindsey Price that character was annoying but she did what she could with it. My advice is to get an addiction and shake your head with it instead of looking at this dreck
