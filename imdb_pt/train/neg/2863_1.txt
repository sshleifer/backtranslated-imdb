I was happy to watch this movie for free as I'm working in the hotel industry and this movie recently came to our movie library. Nothing against low budget movies, but this movie has horrible acting and direction. How can a movie like this be made? The director must be blacklisted, and for all poor actors, it's certainly not a career break. Please make sure that you will not watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and driving horrible. There are just a few more movies out there that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example would be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this movie should give the charity, so at least it serves for good reason. <br /> <br /> In that case, I watched another 10 (or at least one more time).
