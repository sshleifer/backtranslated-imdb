This movie was so bad that I had to advance most of it to get to the good bits. Hah what good bits? the only one that paid off was the end (those who saw the movie will know what I mean). I expected a lot from this movie as an underworld meets the dawn of the dead meets Freddy vs. Jason, but what I got was that crap. The story was forgettable, the cast was poorly used and what the director thought when he did it. This could have been great, but I ended up being the most annoying movie I've ever seen. OK, and if there was a bit of T and A, I was behind the blood and I was deeply disappointed. Do not expect a movie that is good, but if you want a crappy bad horror, then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie should not be done.
