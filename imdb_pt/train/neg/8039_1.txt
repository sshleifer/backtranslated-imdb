This foolish movie is a piece of crap and boring as the house full replays. For all the people who want to see a great, exciting and cool horror movie, they should not even think about watching this crazy piece of work. the F- in my opinion. I have a question, what were they thinking? Let's make a list: 1) bad script 2) bad script 3) bad script 4) bad acting 5) bad direction and last but not least, a bad script. I mean, I do not like all the movies, but I was disappointed when I watched. This movie should be banned in a box, locked and sunk in the sea. So, please do not do something like this again, please, please, please !!!!
