I'd rather have 20 root canals than go through this movie again. The Prince of Annoying, Myles Berkowitz, lost nearly two hours of my life with this cynical pseudo-cool. The only fun thing in all this mess is the nasty sound of Mr. Samaha's camera on breasts and butts. Berkowitz has a great concept and puts it in the dust. He is agitated and poorly done in an apparent effort to make him look bold or funny. It's neither. I rarely feel like a movie was a waste of film (or tape), but this is what qualifies for that distinction. If a date suggests watching this movie, run.
