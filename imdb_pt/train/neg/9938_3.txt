Jean Luc Godard's controversial Marxist poem is the closest movie to a movie you'll probably see from an internationally respected filmmaker. Political theater bits, tediously boring and endless, are interspersed with the production of "Sympathy for the Devil," with the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> Mick Jagger's music development process playing a guitar demo for the backing vocals being recorded at the end is fascinating, and it's worth renting this movie just to see the parts with the Stones. Almost half of the movie is dedicated to that, so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops, you can skip all the weird political skits and just watch the Stones put a song together. <br /> <br /> When I had this on the laserdisc, I valiantly tried to watch it all, but I do not see how one could go through it. I finally gave up and just jumped into the Stones segments.
