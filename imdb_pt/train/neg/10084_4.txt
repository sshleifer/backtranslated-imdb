This movie was good, but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are "born that way," especially when a woman can leave an unhappy marriage and fall into the arms of another woman. It seems almost as if Kate's gender preferences were turned on and off like a switch, making this movie look a bit simplistic. <br /> <br /> Also, as is common in films that are trying to impose an agenda, it was unfortunate. that the characters in the film who had doubts or disapproval about the gay lifestyle were labeled "intolerant." And there was no half happy. Either Kate's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally rejected her. This is not typical of interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect, without necessarily tolerating the choices they make. Unfortunately, the film did not show any of these types of interactions. For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, it seemed to me a very intolerant movie! So, in the end, Kate apparently decides, after all these years, that she wants to be with the Mac and everything is fine - is that what being gay is all about? Let's go!
