To begin with, I'd like to say that I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Even though 'the bare mile' and this are the two worst, this seems to be the downfall of the whole series. <br /> <br /> First, the best part of the movie was that it was an American Pie Movie, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are tons of bad things to say about this movie. First of all, the story has a very obsolete 'arc' structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the compromise of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympics. Each of which is exactly 25 minutes long. In addition to the general plot staleness, there is little or no character development that makes a double hit of a bad conspiracy. Also, I did not really like the stereotype in this movie. That is, showing the athletes as the extremely cool guys who only think about sex, and explicitly showing the geeks as inferior. In addition, it shows females only as sexual objects, and males just want to treat females as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting was also bad. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, a film usually horrible if seen from a critical point of view. If seen from the teenagers' point of view, I think it's better, but this movie is rated 18+ in most countries, so it should not be seen by minors.
