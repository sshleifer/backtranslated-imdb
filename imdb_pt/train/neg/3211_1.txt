And it falls into the category of "incredibly bad" -that is, a drunken movie student rented out for fun. I was at the science fiction festival and all I remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter when this movie was premiered. Other criticisms will better describe the fecal nature of this film, and I felt so bad at the poor producer that appeared, obviously to assess the audience's reaction. What he achieved was the scientific equivalent of an audience of drunken students, and after a "serious" anime film, I think it was "blue sky", the audience was in a gloomy mood, and then that movie opened and in seconds the room was rolling in the islands. I'll point out the worst parts; <br /> <br /> Script: The funniest and worst part of this movie, it goes through a linear and predictable road, with occasional disregard. Garbage, but eminently laughable. <br /> <br /> Animation: poorly done, and together, if you can put up with monotonous funds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (I know I can!), then watch out for the montage where she "transforms "from a Swedish peasant in LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: So one-dimensional is painful, there is a brief history (with broken lines of dialogue) and little light is illuminated in the actual motivation behind some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, if you have a captive audience and some drinks out there (try and make sure they're alcoholic to relieve the pain), then slide this movie to the DVD and enter a mentality of "mystery science theater 3000". There is no other motivation to watch this movie besides laughing at it, and it's not supposed to be a comedy. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE ALONE. It could be even more annoying to watch alone than "New World" with Colin Farrell, since you can not laugh ridicule with a friend or two.
