The rat and the annoying lullaby really hit me and really had nothing to do with the story ... It's something I would have done in my first year at film school. Very sad. Besides, the story seemed to drag on for no apparent reason ... there were a lot of things thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story, which makes me feel that the creative team really did not know what it was. doing, or just that it should have been shorter ... which would have been a blessing, not a crime. As I just watched all the episodes to this point during the past week ... I would have to say that this was by far the worst, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this.
