Although I've never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its horrible production values), it looks like Shakespeare compared to that pile of crap brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Undoubtedly, Scrappy-Doo is about the most annoying and terrible character created for children (and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the tapeworm). Whose brilliant idea was it to create some kind of mutant dog and let him talk and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with him? Whoever it is, deserves to die or to attend this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and irritating on the nerves - and this is only in the BEST episodes !! After many years, it would be better to end the franchise than to create this mess! I can see why in the live action movie Scooby-Doo they made the villain Scrappy-Doo - since virtually everyone hates him!
