Five years after the original Creepshow, another sequel to Under Terror is written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is really original or distinctive either. The first story is a basic story about an Indian wooden statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners. The effects are really interesting in this story, but it's too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners. The second story, "The Raft," is a Stephen King story. There are about four teenagers who unwittingly spend the day on a wooden cot in the middle of a secluded lake. Soon the children are screaming for their lives as a watery drop does each of them for no apparent reason. However, instead of being full of suspense, children are overwhelmed with poor dialogue and reckless behavior, preventing us from really caring about what happens next. There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker," which is actually a recapada adapted to Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was shot in 1953 as a noir thriller. Then it was adapted for a famous episode of Twilight with Inger Stevens. "The Hitch-Hiker" works the best of these three offers, but it's also not without problems. Lois Chiles plays a cheating wife, who just runs over a wanderer, or so she thinks. However, we do not know if we sympathize with her or condemn her. As in many such common stories, the characters exist only to tell the stories with their twists and turns. The story surrounding the bullies seems a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears as the "trawler" in this issue. The good news is that there were no more sequels. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
