If you want to see a mystery, do not watch it. Although there are elements directly from Elmore Leonard's territory, this is close to an episode of "Dynasty," as the filmmaker focuses on "character development" -that is, long and boring conversations between stupid and uninvolved characters. Some people can make fascinating movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this one. Avoid, especially if you like the actors involved in this.
