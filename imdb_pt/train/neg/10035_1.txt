Absolutely horrible movie. Total waste of time. <br /> <br /> Background music is so loud that you can not understand speech. Well, if you really listen closely, what they say is really unintelligible. <br /> <br /> Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives headache, action is poor quality, dialogues are unintelligible, acting is crap and well Kareena used to look like a fighter now she looks like a hungry fighter. Hell, you can lose weight, but you can not earn grace. <br /> <br /> After spending three hours watching a movie, I want to like it, but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, go ahead and see this.
