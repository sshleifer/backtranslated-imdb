"The triumph of love" does not triumph over anything. It is a heavy and heavy journey of 4 hours of torture. In fact, it's a little under 2 hours, it seemed much longer. It hurts to think of the amateur performances of actors as good as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The support players are not so terrible. Maybe they were trying to be so exaggerated, so as to be clownish, but if so, I did not see it that way. Mira Sorvino does not impress one way or the other. She (he) is only there. My guess is that the piece of the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 years ago, is much better. It could not be worse. Clare Peploe, writer and director of this film, was inspired by a recent production of the play. I do not know what she was thinking when she created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything got lost in the translation.
