Great cast. Great performance. Unpredictable story in the first half <br /> <br /> hour or more. I was really wondering what would happen to each of these non-redeeming characters, and how their seemingly disparate lives would intertwine. But when the writers took off the glue to start connecting the players, they, by mistake, used super glue and paralyzed the film. <br /> <br /> In the last two hours. I kept thinking it would look better, but it just got worse. Do not believe the comments. This is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise made it ugly - why? The beautiful bartender wearing cribs - why? I know it had to do with the plot, but without them at least there would have been an attractive cast member to remember.
