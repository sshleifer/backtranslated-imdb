Do you like pretty girls? Yes, me too. What's wrong with saying about beautiful girls / women? Nothing imo, so why would I give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, although it has the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to watch beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something. This is a movie, an action movie called, however. So, by definition, you do not really need a plot right? I'm not 100% agreeing, but let's say yes to that. So what does it need? 20 minutes of footage from part 1 (I might be exaggerating a bit, but it seemed more than 20 minutes ...)! That would be "no". But then again, you never know, people who attended part one may not know what they ate this morning for breakfast, so let's remind them ... hey, maybe, remind them up to two times? Just to make sure they will not forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course !!!! So forget the story, about the character's development, about real emotions, about "acting" (and no, I do not think walking and / or fighting women are responsible for act!) ... what does that leave? Yes the action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and that's the reason why I gave the film 2 stars instead of 1! I was giving this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / watch, believe me ...
