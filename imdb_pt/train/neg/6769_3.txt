Failure. The movie was not good. Has 5 year old humor that will not even laugh. I mean, of course, some parts were fun, but most are not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer), and she should be working on better movies. The film should have been screened as an original Disney Channel movie, which is FREE. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was well done about this movie was the song. Nothing like a refined soundtrack to brighten your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Peter Caleigh, Beach Boy song, Fun Fun Fun. 4 out of 10. If I gave 10, 9 that would be the song and 1 would be the movie. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
