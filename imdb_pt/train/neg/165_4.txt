Although it is early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was smaller than I thought it would be. There is still potential for the series, though. Of course, when I first saw Voyager, I thought it also had potential, but I was very disappointed. My instinct tells me that the Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager, though. <br /> <br /> As for the pilot's impressions ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had good ideas and good themes. I liked the introduction. The opening credits of the program were interesting, with the progress of the exploration and an appropriate theme song. Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain. <br /> <br /> When I missed it for me it was largely that the story did not have the "feel" of going on a great adventure. The plot of the episode itself was more of a "generic" Trek story, with the themes "exploration" and "first step toward space," merely subplot and subtext. If you edited references to this first deep-space mission, it would be difficult to differentiate the plot between the Enterprise, TOS, or TNG eras. The central plot did not reflect or do justice to the great theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The plot to launch the first mission would have been grand enough without the "action". Instead of isolated references to the novelty of exploitation, they could have been history. Stay a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (ah, for a TV show that would again make us think). Make us feel the emotion of the "wind" and be in the "sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a multitude of shootings. There were many shotguns. <br /> <br /> We had the feeling that humans were the "freshmen" of an established school. New children on the block, as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons arrived at our door instead of meeting us. This meeting could have been much more historical and much more sociological. How do two of these different societies interact? Do not just insinuate this, show it! I had to think of it more as "Trek with a clumsy crew and limited technology", as opposed to "the first brave steps in the unknown." I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept, but so far I have not seen this new concept. <br /> <br /> I will conclude with reiterating the feeling that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has potential. The overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes can do justice to this great and wonderful theme, we will have a program that will create new legends. <br /> /> You shoot an arrow in the air ... Good luck Capt. Archer. <br /> <br /> For producers: HAVE MORE RISK AND DO WITH US * THINK! (I.e.
