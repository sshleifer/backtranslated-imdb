In the director of Eric Stanze, "ISOYC, IPOYG", three men are subjected to torture in the hands of a woman who they all sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat her own crap, before she is cut to death. The next guy ends up with a bullet in the groin after refusing to have anal sex with the corpse of the first guy. But it's the third man who gets the worst: he has to watch the tattooed 'star' Emily Haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle (oh, he also catches the butt handle too!). <br /> <br /> And, unfortunately, so do we (let's see her masturbate, that is, not pick up a broom and hold our asses!) <br /> <br /> Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is a difficult viewing experience, not because of her relentless violence, but because Haack, who is obviously baffled by the notion that she has the body of a goddess (as opposed to a Metallica roadie) is constantly naked for the camera . It is not a beautiful sight. <br /> <br /> In addition to the uninterrupted nudity of a haack filled with ink, viewers can also see the dire direction of Stanze (who thinks that countless shots of tombstones and trees are a lot of fun to act, and a one-man penis fat. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current average 2.9. This is a point for the attack of the (which, being a gore-hound, I really liked it), a point for the part where the fat man gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse disguised as feces (hilarious), and a point for pure nerve to suggest that this movie could somehow be a continuation of Meir Zarchi's top-of-the-line classic, I Spit On Your Grave.
