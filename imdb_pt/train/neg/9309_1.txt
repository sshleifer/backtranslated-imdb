Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say about this movie. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes some friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods during a weekend vacation away from work. After picking up a girl on the way, things start to go wrong for all of them. <br /> <br /> The plot alone (written by the actor playing Brandon, I believe, although I may be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and acts accordingly. The "murderous clown" is a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being an obscure, mysterious but above all, clever predator, instead he is offered a half-clumsy, rhyming singer who seems to be going through a minor middle-age crisis. The only thing that justified the writing of this comment was the sex scenes and anything in the movie (the quality of the movie led me to derive some pleasure from these things). <br /> <br /> In short, this movie falls below all possible standards. I admit that I was sharing a few beers with a close friend while I was watching this, so we managed to put together some relative entertainment value from this movie and therefore it is fair to mention that the S.I.C.K fell very close to a rating of two. However, in reality, (and with the benefit of hindsight) the star rating is more than a legitimate score for this movie. <br /> <br /> A star of ten.
