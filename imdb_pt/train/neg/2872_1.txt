This is by far the worst terror / suspense I've seen in my 29 years. If someone offers it to you for free, say NO. This movie makes you a dumber person to know that you watched. The plot is not even the worst part of this movie ..... it's acting, camera work, lighting and sound. There is absolutely nothing to like about this movie. Whoever paid to have this movie is broken now. I hope the director never has the green light for another film. In his defense, this film was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual capture of BTK killer, but I saw the movie from the weeks that looked like the Oscar winners in comparison to that.
