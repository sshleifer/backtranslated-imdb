I tend to like character-driven movies. I also think Hope Davis does a consistently good job, so I had high hopes for this movie. These hopes were soon dashed. <br /> <br /> The main flaw of this movie is the direction. There are many scenes that are sequences of daydreams. The film makes frequent use of the character Denis Leary as the alter ego of the character Campbell Scott. It does not work for me. That would have worked better as a piece than a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters in a movie go through a journey and end up in a different place from where they started. I did not feel that the characters grew up in the experiences portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the issue was not well made either. There was a very big fall in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally annoying. <br /> <br /> Except for acting, which I felt was consistently strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema.
