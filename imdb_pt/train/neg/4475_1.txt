horrible, just awful! my old roommate used to watch this crap and it drove me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and it's a shame that some people never know how it is, because their first impressions are of dribbles like this. they have changed so much that it is hardly recognizable. which perplexes me, since the book looks like a soap opera anyway, providing enough food for modern entertainment. is like one of those Lifetime movies that say "based on a real story", but they are completely fictional. there is no emotion or depth of the book, just irrational melodrama. If you are a high school student looking for a way out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
