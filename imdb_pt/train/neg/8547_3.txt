This was a pretty scary movie; I found the music to be effective for this. The photographs that Mario took of the village were also unnerving. However, I had three problems with this movie. One is that the lighting was very dark, so sometimes it was difficult to tell what was happening, but this may have been just my copy. The second is that the beginning is not explained very well and I'm still not sure what was going on there. The third problem is that I did not understand the ending, but apparently some people do. Of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things, and the male lead is 70 years. All in all, watchable, but not even close to being a favorite.
