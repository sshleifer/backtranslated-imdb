If you've seen other movies like this, it's probably best. The Omega Man comes to mind. For studio credit, they avoided the big, unnecessary and great budget technofest that typifies movies of that type. In addition, the organization and premise were excellent: four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to escape an overwhelming infectious fatal illness. What's bad is EVERYTHING more! I get tired of endlessly stupid, careless, weak, ineffective, arrogant characters in a movie. This pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point. I rented, and I found myself screaming on TV repeatedly, "No, do not do it!", "Why are you so stupid", "look out!", Etc. A true lack of character development is evident in the middle of way. A movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you really care about what happens to them. This not. Also, there should have been a longer, more engaging ending to the film as well.
