This is a terrible movie, terrible script, bad direction and meaningless ending. In addition, bad performances except for Clancy Brown, who is criminally underutilized here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory - you do this to unload enough bad movies to see a good movie in the future. <br /> <br /> The film features a father and son who look like they could not possibly have been related. The male lead part is not well written and seems uncharismatic in that role. You can see the plot points a mile away. The actions of the female leadership and her brother, the police officer, also make no sense. So a big action from her at the end of the movie does not make sense in terms of script.
