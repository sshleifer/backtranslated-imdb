What a burden on the leftist Hollywood basement. This film glorifies the riot as brave and noble, if it is by pacifist principles. The fairy tale ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, actually being promoted by his betrayal. What's with these Hollywood tools? Is this still a return to McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I look cynical it's because I'm sick of movies that promise a political agenda. The brass military in this movie is portrayed as, what else? Gung-ho war merchants. Sound familiar? Ever seen a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about it. Once again, Crimson Tide emphasizes the point. The character of Hackman, the captain of U-boat Ramsey, appears as a delirious lunatic until the end when, of course, he regains his senses, completes 360, renounces his bloodlust, suggests a promotion for the traitor Ron Hunter , and regrets retiring from service. A guy riots, takes command of your boat, puts the US at serious risk of receiving a first nuclear attack, and you promote it ???? Bullshit!
