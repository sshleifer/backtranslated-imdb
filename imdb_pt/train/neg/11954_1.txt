This movie was terrible. Throughout the film, I was baffled and did not see any point in that. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was. This movie is not worth watching at all. Not only is it sick and revolting, but totally stupid! Please do not watch unless you are one of those who likes to watch bad movies. If this movie questions Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, then this is a country that I would not want to visit or worry about meeting. This is a totally sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not like it because it did not make sense. My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror, because that's what was listed below. It was a total disappointment.
