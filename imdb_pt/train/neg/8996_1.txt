In the future of 1985, a government committee led by Howard Hesseman is holding hearings on the first uncensored TV network. They experience programming, which is a series of skits. I can name the good skit movies, on the one hand, without using my thumb. "Women of the Amazon on the Moon," "Kentucky Fried Movie," "The Sense of Life," and "Mr. Mondo's Mondo Video." Notice how I did not mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason for this is that this 'movie' is death in cinematic form. None of the skits are even strangely funny, or even a little clever. It takes some kind of great ineptitude on the part of the filmmakers to not even give a chuckle to me. <br /> <br /> My notes: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn gets full frontal
