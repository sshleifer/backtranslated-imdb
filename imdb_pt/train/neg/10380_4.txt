I do not think anyone sitting to watch this movie would be expecting something remotely appearing as a classic ghost story, but you have to wonder when it's over if you're scared. This does not really work at this level, but the cast struggles hard and the film does not focus on one of those happy endings. Story is about an American couple who travels to Kyoto, Japan, so that Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book and he brings his wife Laura (Susan George) and his daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). His friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) who works at the American Consulate helps them find a home to live in and he finds one that is haunted. About 140 years earlier, in the same house, a Samurai found his wife betraying him and he kills both and then commits suicide. His ghosts still inhabit the house and when Fletcher arrives, it will not be long before strange things start to happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes ghosts inhabit Fletcher's bodies and they begin to act like the Japanese people they were before and Laura starts flirting with Alex, which leads to an affair. Meanwhile, Ted begins to behave more strictly and, after serving soup in Amy's throat, he asks for help from a monk. Unfortunately, the ghosts make Ted, Laura and Alex stage their death scene as they did 140 years earlier. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by Kevin Connor who is known as a good television director but has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with McClure on some of them. While this never comes close to being a scary or developing environment, there are two things that I liked. First, there is one of those sentimental endings in which the couple embrace after defeating the demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight, where everyone succumbs to the evil of ghosts. Second, there's Susan George in the cast! I've always been a fan of her, although she has appeared most of the time, but her performances are always top notch. Also she usually appears naked, which she does here in two separate scenes and although she does not have classic features, she has a unique look like her and is one of the reasons she was so popular. But after appearing in silly movies like this, I think it has driven her out of business or working only sporadically. This is not a bad movie but it is never convincing and watching the ghosts running when the Monk gives an exorcism is pretty much worth a giggle or two. The bottom line is that this is silly and I hope George decides to resume his career.
