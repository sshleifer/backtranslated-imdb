I saw this movie without knowing anything about it before hand. The plot was terrible, with large gaps in information missing. The movie does not have the "battle of judgment" for me. The actors just vomited a lot of nonsense, sometimes making me grind my teeth in agony as they continued to hum. The plot was predictable, except for the erotic homo erotic scene of the stomach at the end (I'm not homophobic, but it made me physically sick), until the end was predictable. And you could say that the detective was Jude Law in a costume, everything from the false accent, the bad dental work, the hairdresser, everything indicated that it was a disguise. The whole movie seemed like a waste of time in my life. This movie had the feel of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as dolls and the house as the window to see the show, really boooring in my opinion.
