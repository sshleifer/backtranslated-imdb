I'm a big fan of Willem Dafoe, and I really looked for this movie (I had to buy a Chinese DVD from Region 5!). But, it's really one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The acting (except Dafoe) is awful. Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH have written and directed this (although he is not credited as a director), and lack discernible talents to write or direct. (Stick to acting Willem; Giada get out of business, please!) <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing happens. Except for a series of totally unconvincing motivations, totally unreliable, these two people (who have just met) in this house. Colagrande is sleepy, I could not care less expression almost never changes. And the sex scenes are downright stuck. I actually cringed twice in one of them. Disgusting! They definitely are not at all erotic, and yet they are the only time the movie is not putting you to sleep. So, it's busy repelling you. <br /> <br /> Just horrible.
