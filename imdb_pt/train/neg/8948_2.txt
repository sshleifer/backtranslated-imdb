'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and nobody is trustworthy. It's a very dark movie, and it's one that will not make you feel good about yourself. It's about a romance going on in this society and the betrayal of lovers and about human nature being egocentric. The film has some very good ideas and is well portrayed in this society with dark tones in color (contrasting with happiness and bright colors in dreams) and a general feeling of solitude through objects, people and places. However, despite the film's cleverness in portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to understand the idea well. He seemed to spend a lot of time being smart rather than telling a story.
