Generally I do not do less and if this site I could give this movie -3 out of 10 means that I really hated this movie. I thought Uwe Boll is alone in the dark was the worst I've ever seen, but at least I gave him a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so I boosted the ratings a bit). Hell if it was compared to bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for best picture if they were competing. <br /> <br /> Now for the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer, which is fine, but they could have done better. The beginning seemed OK, but that's what I had to speed up most of because death is boring. I like killer movies and even though they suck, they still may have some cool killings. I'm not an expert on flamboyant films, but believe me, he would have killed himself if he had seen this. Sorry for rambling, but there's nothing good to say about it because it looks like someone took a camcorder and filmed it .. this .. thing of disaster. Uwe Boll his films are no longer on my list of worst movies that have ever taken the cake. <br /> <br /> Well, sorry, I could not explain the plot (if there was one), but that was the best I could. Now if you do not mind I'll drag myself in a corner and move back and forth and remind myself how bad this movie scared me for life ... OK, not for life
