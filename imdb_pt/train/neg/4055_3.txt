I read comments that apparently you have to have been a student at a very rigorous British school in the 1960s to understand this. Maybe it's true, if so, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************ ************** The ending makes as much sense as all the children who are anti-government and anti-corporation without having any better solution that does not take society to an embassy like Mad Max. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters can leave, but they do not. The reasons why they do this do not make sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What is supposed to shoot a bunch of innocent people is never explained or even hinted at. It is mentioned that war is the last creative expression, possibly the only revelation that any character in this film has, and does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The characters involved in a series of murders are not fighting. the institution, they are just killing people. I thought they could have used all the explosives to blow up the place, or at least the sanctuary in the end, this would have made a greater symbolic sense, but they did not. <br /> <br /> - This movie is a teenager's dream of fighting against the authority that torments them, although in reality they need it. It has no moral or symbolic truth or meaning to it; this film simply enacts the fantasy of killing teachers and people in "power" that bother him. <br /> <br /> If you think that a fury murder / school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way of dealing with teachers and institutions you do not like, then I think you will love it this movie. If you are like me and are working to create a life for yourself instead of just blindly (very blindly in this movie) rebelling against "the man," this movie is juvenile and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also say in parts that funding was lacking, and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder. <br /> <br /> All in all, this seems like a very rough sketch of what could have been an Ok movie, but no effort is put into dialogue, character or moral development so it's just ... badly done. <br /> <br /> If only I could have my two hours back.
