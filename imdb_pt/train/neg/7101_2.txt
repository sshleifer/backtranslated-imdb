I would give this movie a zero of ten, but I'll give it a two. The reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this film and makes a kiss with Kamal. I really love Rani and I have a respect that she is a great actress. That's why I did not like her in this movie kissing Kamal, but no big deal. Anyway, enough of the room scenes that made this movie noticeable, really lets talk about this movie. It's good or bad, I think it's a completely bad movie that made me yawn. I being a fantastic reviewer, you can see my other review of 250+ by clicking on my name, I have very good taste. The movie is not fun is one thing and if this is supposed to be hard to beat the cinema, why there is no moral in this movie. It's a biased film that is not a true story and it stinks. Watching Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, the man can not kiss properly anyway.
