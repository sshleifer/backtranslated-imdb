Cool Boston turned his tail and headed for the barn door and the pigpool he created! When this show was first shown almost four seasons ago, it was a humorous slap in the legal system that all actors seem to be proud of portraying. It was funny, diversified, and to some extent factual. The characters portrayed were acceptable and to some extent real in their portraits. Sexual commentary and activity were limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series that she has participated but is now drawn into the depths of the media programming of sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Ren√© Adjurdubois He is an excellent actor that from the times of "Benson" until this production was realized in the field of the entertainment, always showing the humor and the respectful performance of the production. Captain Kirk "is". Funny and humorous is Candace Bergan and must be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt in his acting ability, however, he must return to his XXX origins, such as "Crash", as it seems that he has a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We ask that this series be destroyed as it already is and is really starting to smell !!!
