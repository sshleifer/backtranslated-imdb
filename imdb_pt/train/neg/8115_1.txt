This movie was the most horrible movie watching experience I've ever had to endure, and what's worse is the fact that I had to watch it, and I did not get a chance to stop it because it was for school! Of course, the plot was decent ... but I found the acting terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. She was the only highlight without her, I doubt she would have been able to afford to watch the movie. Every time I hear someone say "daarling" I shrink! I almost attacked a client the other day because they said "this". It reminded me of one of the worst one and a half hours of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if this offended someone, I'm just expressing my opinion)
