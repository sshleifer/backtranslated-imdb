Disney goes to the well many times, since anyone who has seen the original LITTLE SERAID will feel blatantly stolen. Celebrating the birth of their daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to introduce her to King Triton. The commemoration is quickly broken by Ursula's sister, Morgana, who plans to use Melody as a defense tool to obtain the king's trident. Stopping the attack, Ariel and Eric build a wall around the ocean while Melody grows wondering why she can not go there. <br /> <br /> Terrible and terrible is what describes this direct sequence to the sequence of videos. LITTLE SERMAID 2 gives you that feeling that everything you watch seems to have come straight to other Disney movies. I think Disney can only plagiarize itself! Do not tell me that the penguin and the walrus do not remember another duo of LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other disappointing moments include the rematch between Sebastien and Louie, the real chef. They were terribly underplayed! The climax between Morgana and EVERYONE seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I would not give anything, but in 75 minutes everything seemed incredibly tight and a lot to deal with. An embarrassment to Disney, it is best left to LADTLE SERMAID 2 to rent and laugh. So you can prepare for the rest of the other sequences that Disney will drown you in later.
