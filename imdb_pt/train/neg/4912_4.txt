Not having read the novel, I can not say how faithful this film is. History is a typical material of mystery: murderous targets newly married; woman researcher falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it plays. The first 2/3 are dull, with the exception of the killings and the last 1/3 makes a partial return as the speed increases toward its distorted conclusion. <br /> <br /> The acting is strictly inferior, although it is difficult to blame the actors alone: ​​the script is atrocious. During the last 1/3 you do not notice why the movie actually becomes interesting, but that's just the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element, but there is much he can do with the TV budget and network censors in the back. He is very limited to quick cuts and distorted lenses, although he managed to squeeze some "under the floor" photos during the murders in the club bathroom. Unfortunately, as this is done for the TV, the legal details of composition that it uses so well with a wider picture are far from being found. Note to producers: Give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when hiring him. <br /> <br /> In short: this movie is bad for movie standards and mediocre for TV standards (watch CSI). If you're in the mood for a movie like this, I have some great suggestions: get a copy of Dario Argento's "Deep Red" (my highest recommendation, superb movie), "Opera" or even "Tenebre." They are stronger in all categories.
