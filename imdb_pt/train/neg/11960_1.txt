In fact, I retired from Asian horror movies some time ago, after getting completely sick of seeing the same ghost story trash. However, I have been moving more and more into exploration films recently and decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was the highly rated "Visitor Q" by director Takashi Miike. I've seen the Audition, and although I do not like it very much, I rate it as one of the best modern Asian horror films. So I went into it with sensible expectations; and unfortunately, found only boredom. I suppose this movie is really clever and just went over my head, but what it seemed to me was simply a collection of violent and unpleasant scenes with little or no coherence between them. Any comparisons with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch are blasphemous as far as I am concerned; all Miike did here is make a movie; any intelligence around it has been implemented by pretentious, desperate fans to find some kind of meaning. My headache settled in about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and that did not subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it seems. Do not get me wrong, I'm not against the violence in the movies and, in fact, I'm actively looking for the most notorious movies out there; but while this can be violent, it is also meaningless and annoying and I did not get a drop of enjoyment from it. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope this is the last time I get in touch with one of your movies.
