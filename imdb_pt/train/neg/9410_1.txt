As long as you can suffer! If you like to see people waking up, getting up, getting dressed, taking a shower, preparing dinner, watching each other, having sex in the dark, then going back to bed to sleep ... if you like flat apartments, and kitchens, long minutes of silence ... if you like to get bored for two hours, feeling the thrill of "true fake intimate art," then you will like it. But if you do not, just try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "As long as you're here," but do we want to stay? This German film received the award from the Turin gay film festival: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury made such a bad decision, since the festival presented many talented films. Maybe to be cool with a German, since they do not always get prizes? Well, "The Lives of Others" did ... but this one is great, but it's not gay. So maybe it's a fashion issue. Are the Germans "again"? No matter what? Or maybe just by the look of some of a cheater's directors?
