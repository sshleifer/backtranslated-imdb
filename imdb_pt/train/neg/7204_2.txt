This is one of those movies that you think manufacturers would refuse to release because it is so terrible. Obviously they were thinking that kids are stupid and are great at absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertaining because it's funny. What about the talking car with buttons that say Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M's and Skittles? There was no car talking in the cartoon. (Dr.) Claw is supposed to be bad, not cute and charming. Why is Rupert Everet 'Claw' like that? Were the writers using drugs when they wrote these scenes? It seems they were (evil) satirizing Robo Cop, with the transformation of a man into an android combat crime. I tried to get my money back, but there was a policy that if you watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you do not get a refund. I'm sorry, I watched over 30 minutes of that pile of crap. After being told the non-refund policy, I decided to look at the rest of the horrible junk called Inspector Gadget.
