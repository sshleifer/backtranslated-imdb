Power Rangers, the utterly awful children's show of the 90s, still continues to bother small kids with their complete extravaganzas and horrific scenarios. <br /> <br /> This show was not entertainment, it was an excuse to teach children the violence in showing the children struggle with each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> The toys were another demonstration of how to promote a violent television program and such. <br /> <br /> I was never able to figure out what the purpose of this show was completely ridiculous. As such, it remains one of the worst children's shows ever made.
