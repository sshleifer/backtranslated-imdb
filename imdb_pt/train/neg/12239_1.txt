Since I was eight years old I have been a big fan of wrestling. It did not matter which federation I watched. WWE, WCW, USWA. To me, action is all I've seen. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. That was my nineteenth birthday. I asked for Over the Edge and I was just waiting for another pay-per-view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead, it was the night that one of the best wrestlers to leave Canada, a real human being dropped to death due to a mistake that went awry. There is not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened after Owens's death made me crazy. <br /> <br /> Instead of ending the pay per view and doing the right thing as humans, WWE decided to protect what comes first and that was the money keeping the pay per view going as if the death of Owens never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you. Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but that was by far the most stupid decision he ever made. <br /> <br /> And such a crap to say that Owen would have wanted the payroll to continue. Give me some time. When someone dies in a bank of payments, see your common sense of stopping it. It's like a cop shooting a thief or burglar with a run and then leaving the man to die, so he can go home and close the day as if the man's life never mattered. <br /> <br /> But no No matter what happens. Owen will be lost and thank you for the memories of all the times you gave us.
