Congratulations to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room every day to look at the role of Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars of the 1930s and I wonder how many people these days - apart from fans of classic cinema - know anything about it. He was a giant in business for at least a decade. He could have won the Oscar for this performance, which would give him two in a row, as he won by playing Louis Pasteur the previous year. My personal opinion is that although he tended to get over it a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". Any part he played; you were fascinated by the screen when you saw it. <br /> <br /> Unlike Pasteur's role, I found that this story smelled a little too much of what we've seen over the last 60 years: going overboard to make a Liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not repress its disdain for the police or the military, insisting here to tell us how "corrupt" these organizations are. Filmmakers love when authority is challenged and defeated. In this sense, this film is way ahead of its day since we have seen this great moment since the decade of 1960. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that the facts corroborate this story. Nor does it in any way diminish Zola's achievements as a social reformer, getting rid of certain evils. Good for it! I wish they had spent more time showing it than focusing on a test.
