"White Noise" had the potential to be one of the most talked about films since "The Exorcist," I think. Seeing how EVP is supposed to be true, actually had an easy passage to be a feared true fact. Not many movies really instigate fear in people's minds. Like I said this movie could have, but it did not. The film has degraded into a scary low-grade PG-13 movie. Nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense" by any means. Someone really just needs to take over the horror movie industry and just make a movie that does not just make us think but make us jump, scream, everything a horror movie should do. I'm honestly sick of the PG-13 horror genre because it's becoming a genre of its own. We need the old days back, the days of blood and blood, the days of Freddy Kruger, Jason, The Mike Myers. Few movies can think that this mentality is not so scary. So why try to do this? Some good leaps in this movie represent just one of the stupidest finals in movie history, with no resolution ... do not waste your money on this movie.
