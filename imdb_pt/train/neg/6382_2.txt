It's hard to know what was going on in the heads of Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg when they wrote "Gayniggers from Outer Space" - the movie is billed as a comedy, but there are no real jokes besides the characters' raw names (Captain B. Dick, Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the film is a (presumably) unintentionally funny case with ridiculously unsynchronized narratives (with the 'actors' basically reading their speeches with no sign of feeling), 'futuristic' computer displays full of misspellings, and a plot that makes almost no sense. <br /> <br /> Even though 65% of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, this is the complete opposite of what a good movie is. It might be ENTERTAINMENT to watch with some friends, but this movie deserves only a '2' out of ten ... slightly higher than the lowest rating possible just because of the simple fact that writers somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie.
