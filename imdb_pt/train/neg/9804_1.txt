The power rangers, the boys of merchandising television of the 1990s, have to be the most senseless and ridiculous television show ever created. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this show, besides selling the second? absurd plastic rate for children? There is nothing remotely rescuing or interesting about this show anyway. <br /> <br /> See the costumes, which look like bad spandex. <br /> <br /> The hair style mullet, earrings, and fashions of the early 90's look completely ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
