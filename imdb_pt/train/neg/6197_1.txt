At the end of the movie I just asked myself: "Is it the worst movie I've ever seen or is it the worst movie I've ever seen?". And the answer is ... In fact, after seeing this movie and thinking a little about the meaning of it, you just can not find any meaning and can only remember the two scenes of rape, which are incredibly brutal and useless. It seems to me that the director tried to push this issue to the head of the crowd: "what are crimes like that compared to the horror of war and extermination?" because I noticed that the two terrible scenes were directly linked to the war and the horrors (during the first scene you can hear the girl being raped screaming and at the same time hear one of President Bush's speeches about the need to start a war with and in the second scene, photos of the three criminals shoving a sword into a woman's vagina are directly followed by footage from World War II, but, as a matter of fact, I really could not think about the relative severity of theses two different types of human horror expression, being made I was very shocked at what I had just seen and felt (sorry for bad English)
