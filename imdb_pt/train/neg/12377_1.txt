Just because someone is under 10 years old does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this movie, it better be tested. I am always struck by the fact that so many people can get involved in something that ends up being so bad. This "movie" is a showcase of digital magic AND NOTHING ELSE. The writing is horrible. I do not remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are beyond misery. The acting is sub-par, but the actors did not receive much. Who decided to employ Joey Fatone? He can not sing and is ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst is the truism of it all. It's as if writers struggle to make everything as stupid as possible. Great children's films are bad, clever and humorous - films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches to mention two of the past. But in the continued doldrums of the American, there are more affluents like Finding Nemo (yes, that's right), the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the rubbish of the eyes like the Red Riding Hood.
