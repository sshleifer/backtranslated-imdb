You would not expect a movie like this to be good, and it's not. It's an ultra-violent zombie movie with no budget, filmed with a bad-looking camera ... and it's hilarious. The actors have obviously never acted before and this shows up in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The small plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombies seems to be terrorizing some families. The bloody effects are actually some of the most disgusting I've ever seen. It seems that people have attacked a butcher's shop all over the body, and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. It's a funny and sickly movie, and it's as bad as you get in terms of any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 min.
