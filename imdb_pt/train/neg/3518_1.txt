I saw this movie with my climbing instructor, and we found the whole thing so ridiculous to be beyond pity. (On the one hand, if Stallone is free climbing alone, there is no need to carry any equipment, but I think these pendant carabiners seem sort of "mountain mountaineering," so let's throw them in.) For the lobotomized people who think Colorado looks nothing like the Dolomites in Italy (where the movie was filmed), well, Hollywood moguls have much more ridiculous and scary things for you to swallow.
