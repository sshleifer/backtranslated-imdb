I still find it hard to understand that such a bad movie could be done in Hollywood. The acting and the story are simply pathetic and the direction is horrible. I do not see any logic behind that garbage, unless the director has nothing good to do. It took me ten minutes to realize that I had wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with dismay that I was going to waste more time of my life on this piece of crap. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I do not know which category fits. Please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do anything, even bump your head against the walls, but do not go to this movie.
