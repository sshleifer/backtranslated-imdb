This would have to be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I've ever seen. I could not watch all the way. Purely and simply is gratuitous violence just because of it and the ridiculous plot only adds to the filthy and incompetent filming. Sick. And just suitable for those with a love for manic mutilation. After murdering several hundred men, women and children, Seed is finally captured after he effortlessly kills several other police officers who finally receive a hint about his whereabouts. He is condemned to death by electric chair and survives miraculously! Buried alive, he clears the way and plans to take revenge on those who turned him away and turned the switch on. Needless to say, more horrible murders happen ...
