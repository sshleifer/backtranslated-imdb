I do not know, sometimes ... you try and try to be charitable with all the films from B to Z, but every now and then a certain movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. "Bat People" (which I saw under the title "It Lives By Night") is just one of those films. You can not watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode in "Night Gallery", not one of the best, either. <br /> <br /> The film has something to do with a doctor who is bitten by a bat and consequently begins to turn into a Were-Bat who drinks human blood. (Actually, you would think that if he were turning into a real bat he would be eating mosquitoes on the gal, but since this is a cheap and sinister horror movie, blood is the word.) Despite the fact that he has grand-evil seizures in the fall of a hat and episodes of blackout almost every night, his friend and fellow physician, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists he is only having an "allergic reaction" to the shots of rabies. Meanwhile, the world's most obnoxious and stereotypical county sheriff suspects the document of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local (and drunken) girls. Meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that denial is a river in Egypt and, alternatively, sponsors it and bothers him for distraction. <br /> <br /> It's not so much that acting is bad - you can say that the actors are making professional level choices, and are trying to bring some life and juice to the screenplay, even the guy who plays the Sheriff. (Ok, it's too bad, but it's bad in a clich√©, wooden, professional way). It's just that everything about the acting, the way the scenes are played, the costumes, the dialogue, the script and the story in general, put your teeth on the edge and make you want to slap everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I think the movie had a chance to be a scary little cult favorite, BUT: <br /> <br /> 1) The director needed to defeat Michael Pataki, an experienced actor with a chair until Pataki agreed with the ACT, and not just with the Dennis Weaver channel. <br /> <br /> 2) He also needed to find a script that would make a bit more sense with respect to the whole scenario "Bat Bites Human, Who Then Turns Into A Bat." <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable for his episodes, instead of turning to the "Man Has a Seizure" page of the Little Book of Gold Mannerisms in Action. 4) He needed to retake all the character of 'wife', make her smarter, less strident and smarter. <br /> <br /> I would never voluntarily watch this movie again, except with the help of Mike and the Bots. It's bad, but not bad in a silly, funny or interesting way. Even better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld", however.
