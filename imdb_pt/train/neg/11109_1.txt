I'm really surprised this movie has a rating like that! I have not seen such a bad movie in years. That was a really bad movie. Splatter, is not enough to describe the unnecessary (almost funny) blood scenes. If you did not like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ..well that's 10 times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine shivers.! <br /> <br /> I can not tell you about acting since the script was so terrible. Clich√© all the time. (why should I write 10 lines?) I never understood that.) <br /> <br /> Here come spoilers == <br /> <br /> The story is about a butcher killing people all the time on the subway. We're talking about thousands of murders and no one notices. In fact, these people are missing. And there's the cool guy who tries to solve the mystery (well, there's no mystery to us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and as usual no one believes him! What a surprise! In the end, he puts on butcher's clothing and fights to the death with the butcher killer!
