A rather senseless attempt at a Hitchcock-type mystery thriller, exchanging unlikely espionage for archeology and based on Robin Cook's novel; By the way, I recently acquired another adaptation of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the record, director Schaffner had just made THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) - a similarly fanciful but much more engaging suspension, and unfortunately SPHINX was a false step from which his impressive career would not recover. <br /> Despite its reasonably decent scope and cast, however, this proved to be a critical and commercial failure - mainly because the narrative is not very exciting: in fact, it is rather sad (weak attempts at horror - the heroine archeologist taking to endure the burial, the corpses rotting, and even an attack by a burst of bats - nonetheless. Lesley Anne-Down is the lovely main lady, stumbling into a lost treasure - in fact, she was hidden by a local sect to avoid which fell into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated much of the country's inheritance (under the pretext of culture) for too long.John Gielgud appears as an anti-money dealer who puts in the way of the loot, and pays for this' act of betrayal 'with his life. <br /> <br /> Some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be - so apparent allies (like Maurice Ronet) end up being exposed as villains, while a fig an ambiguous (Frank Langella, I saw in London in early 2007 in a West End performance) of "Frost / Nixon," which now turned into a film) goes from Down's antagonist to his lover and vice versa, as he decides to keep the wealth belonging to the Egyptian high priest Menephta a national treasure.
