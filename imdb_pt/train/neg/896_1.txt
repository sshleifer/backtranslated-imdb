This movie is horrible. Not offensive, but extremely predictable. The film follows the life of a small town in the mid-1960s. The father, the school principal, is going through a middle-aged crisis. Enter a handsome big-city teacher who starts challenging the minds of his students with some thought-provoking things, like thinking for yourself. The director does not agree with her teaching, but she is beautiful. You can connect the dots. Her teenage daughter (Winona Ryder, aspiring Tara Frederick) is tired of the small-town lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, goes out with some bad boys, and apparently family planning was not being taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro worked primarily on TV, this movie touches as a more adult version of a special after-school or a very special episode of one of the most mundane sitcoms.
