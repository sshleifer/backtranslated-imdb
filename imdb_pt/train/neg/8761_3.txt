My girlfriend has a habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies that no one has ever heard of. Admittedly, it sometimes led to some fun discoveries. Often the best that can be said is that they definitely run an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> She brought home "Advice from a caterpillar." She was excited because the box said it was funny. Luckily, the ad in the boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This movie was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies in which, unless you are a shallow and pretentious person who likes to watch movies about yourself, you will hate all the characters in the movie. Until the introduction of the legal character. That stupid boring lead character will fall in love and act in such a way that, in the real world, would push anyone away. <br /> <br /> So, a bunch of emotionally insipid, smug and pretentious artists swear love and find success in their careers. So they find a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (a near-perfect guy). Do we then watch the woman, the annoyingly pretentious artist (in her 30s?) Surge when she falls in love. Then she tries to run away from the cool, intelligent and emotionally mature man and stay with the married man with whom she is having a great but empty sex. She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to push him away. In the real world, she would have been successful. I certainly wanted to get away from her and I was not even in a relationship with her! <br /> <br /> Although it is good that the man 'fought for his love', I never wanted her to have it. (Not my girlfriend) She did not deserve it. And, why do I ask myself, does the director think the "near-perfect guy" should be punished for having to gain a relationship with her? When the artist was asking for the 'almost perfect guy' to come out, we were screaming for him to leave too. There's a problem with a movie when the heroine in the movie is so boring, childish and stupid that you want it to fail. <br /> <br /> In addition, let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times although his character was also pretentious to the point of annoying. As for the other characters, they were well-behaved, morally bankrupt, and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say that I laugh a few times in the movie. Unfortunately, there was not much laughter until the last 10 minutes. But by the time I got these laughs, I was praying that the movie would end for a long time. I needed to get these insipid characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch people you hate fighting with a love for people they do not deserve, then this is the movie for you.
