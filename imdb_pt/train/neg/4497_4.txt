- I had planned to write something explaining what I did not like about this movie, but this will be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I do not remember much about it. I watched it only three days ago and it almost did not impress me. This is usually the sign of a real stinker. The only thing I remember was being incredibly bored with the bulk. The novelty of having a detective-like Humphrey Bogart quickly wore off. It would be different if he could perform, but he is a one-note artist. The murder scenes were kindly manipulated and there was no suspense leading to them. If you can not identify the killer five minutes in the movie, you need to see more horror of the Euro. The cast is a dead endowment for the killer's identity.
