The plot was fine. Akshay Kumar was as good as ever and that was the only good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was so much hue and cry about her size zero, but she did not look much thinner. I do not know why the hell Anil Kapoor took such a bad part. There was not much to do for him in the movie. Just because it is a Yashraj movie does not mean that an actor should accept the role no matter how bad it is. Said Ali Khan was fine. I think it's time for Indian directors and producers to start thinking of Indian customers as a smart group. What are we ? fools !!!! Whatever they think, they'll show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad for teeters and we'll believe them. It is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to arrest some criminals ... they take an entire squad of over 100 police officers and no one was there to surround the palace. The action was crap and I've never seen such a bad action. Akshay Kumar was among a circle of 30 to 40 policemen shooting at him ... and he fired back at them. None of the cops' bullets touched him, but he killed all the cops. Filth. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the fight director who thought of this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend you DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
