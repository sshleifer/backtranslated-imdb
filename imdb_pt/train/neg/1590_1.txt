HAH! So this is the movie that the "Next Action Stars" were getting into. Well, I'm glad I did not participate and did not win ... <br /> <br /> Is not it funny how you can look in the first 10 seconds (!) And make up the others? about a movie? I mean, come on! Just look at these titles! I watched this movie (or part of this "teleplay" since it was produced for TV and we could not bear to watch the whole thing) one night while we were doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical mishmash of average guys who once and for all in when they watch shows like Las Vegas just for the girls on the show. so the bar was not too loud, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and it was not because of the great screenplay), but the total lack of originality, acting, script and almost everything else that makes a movie good it made it very easy to change the channel to Las Vegas (or was it CSI? I can not remember ...) no complaints from the rest of the group And this is rare (!) For God's sake It's not for this movie! Well, since Joel Silver actually produced some of the best action movies out there (Die Hard, Matrix 1 just to say that producers do not give the movie quality, they provide money to the directors, and selling that movie just because it's a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious glitches from the crew who actually did it.
