someone needed to make a car payment ... that's really horrible ... it makes Claude's cyborg seem to have gone with the wind ... this is an hour I wish I could go back ... luckily it produced serious drowsiness ... from which I fell asleep. as actors of that caliber can raise this dog? I would rather spend time watching algae grow next to an aquarium than participate in this utterly terrible mix of various genres. I now use the DVD as a rest on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at Walmart is a lot to spend on this movie ... if you really have to have it, wait until they throw them away after loading them in inventory for several years and being frustrated they do not sell. Please, for Christ's sake, let this movie die of obscurity.
