Some reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about an epidemic of zombies, despite the "government controlling the media." The ingredients in the film do not understand that George Romero's zombie movies only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films ("Land of the Dead"). This satire is as subtle as a brick in the face or a bullet in the head is more appropriate for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle about seeing a military man masturbating to death and destruction? Anything about the various commercials that are interspersed with the movie? No. In addition, the acting is uniformly awful, the characters are completely unpleasant and the plot is lost. Put it all together and you'll have the worst and most incompetent zombie movie since "C.H.U.D. 2" created the horrible head. My Note: D
