I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie ... not one single thing. The script is a nightmare .. the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and does not seem to understand the difference. You think they would have at least one technical consultant. The performances were bad for most of the cast ... although I did not really blame them ... the stuff really stinks. The issue was equally bad .. I'm going to stop now .. it's all bad 2/10
