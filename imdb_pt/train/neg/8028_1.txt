Please! Do not waste money on this movie. It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch made by some high school kids. I could not finish watching it and I usually like watching all kinds of B movies. How on earth could they find a distributor for this? !!! Funny, though: Check Wikipedia for "dark area". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got a lot of money from the producers. Money that should have been spent on actors, camera and editing. Even that would not have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, the "dark area" has received a lot of attention. Please director, producer and author of this film, stop making movies like this ... you're not doing yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
