A major disappointment of writer Hamm and director Dante. His previous collaboration in the first season's "Homecoming" was distorted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways. This mismanagement of an intriguing premise left me perplexed. The supposed "pay", showing generic aliens extracting something from the brain of the infected psychopaths, was completely unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial "cleansing" of the planet from its human infestation, why did they do it in such a sadistic and misogynistic way? Why not just release a completely lethal virus like Stephen King's "The Stand," instead of having the male population killing the females? I kept waiting for the episode to improve as I continued to watch, but it became prettier and absurd. The religious subtext seemed simply forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm must have thought he was profound by the weight he gave him. I really like the work of Dante and Hamm, but that was simply impossible to be seen.
