The film recovers after the last few years redo with the military installation of electronic surveillance equipment in the desert, where the attacks on the first film took place. The crew is killed shortly before a group of soldiers in a training exercise appear to find no one around. You can fill in the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a salary photo everywhere. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performances, nor in anyone behind the camera. This is a movie that was made for the money and nothing more. On some level this should have worked, it could have been a more awful Southern Comfort (where national guards conflicted with some people in the swamps), but instead it's not much. For the most part, you can blame the script, written unbelievably in part by Wes Craven, who hits the same old targets again and again. Add to the mess the fact that the direction is monotonous and the sequence setup is so weak that it removes any tension inherent in any scene. <br /> <br /> It's not bad as such, but badly made and bland. . Let me put my feelings in context: The reason I saw this movie was because a local multiplex spoiled everything and ran this movie instead of the children passing Last Mimzy and I wanted to see what caused the crying (I mean, the movies very much in common, he says sarcastically). I'm convinced that this movie will only scare those who like the latest Mimzy.
