This is one of those movies that I could only watch once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialogue, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Surely, that was in 1933, but it really did sizzle. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (faces there begged for a recognition that was not available). The film just came together without cohesion. Much of the spirit, humor and continuity of Lewis Carrols is missing. What a pity! It's a great book. I would recommend the 1951 version of Disney.
