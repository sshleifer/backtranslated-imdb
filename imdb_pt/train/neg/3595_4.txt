I was not as "lucky" as some of the others commenting on this film: I've never seen anything else outside the ... let's say ... Sarno's "fecund" mind. I agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and (go-go) dancing are not really that attractive. I kind of liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so homely, she was cute! The performance was also well done, although delivering lines in a second language may have explained much of this problem. Trying to follow the plot was an important task: was there one, really? I honestly agree with another comment: for a vampire movie, there is not much blood. Yes, if you want GOOD blood sucking movies, check out these Hammer classics as "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "Brides of Dracula". <br /> <br /> The most (unintentionally) humorous part is where the doctor has her clothes ripped off by a cloud of bats ... you've never seen! ... the bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Sure as a waste of time if you happen to get you cable here in the Great White North, but for God's sake, do not rent!
