* SPOILERS * I'm sure that when this was released in 1958, it was very appropriate for your time. At that time, the films were slower to allow the audience to follow and analyze the story. Here a man moves to a house of his last wife who died mysteriously with his new wife. Gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed the film) really is an understated character. He picks up a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that she is in trouble, since he knew there was a crime in the death of the first wife. He can not tell Jenni directly what happened, so he tries to scare her with the skull. Jenni, we also discovered, saw her parents die, thus causing a life of mental anguish that led to institutionalization. Like many audiences today, I found the pace a bit too slow for my taste. But if you like slow terror without much blood, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
