Well, I just paid a dollar for a DVD of that movie, and it was not worth it. It seems to be of a poor print and is in the public domain, I'm guessing. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite her glory, awards and reputation - is a homely British girl who can not sing or dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the old Hollywood actors on display must have thought they were making a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented woman on the screen. He was wrong. It was unlikely to be popular in Britain before and after World War II. His "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than his musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a few famous songs are included and none of them are well presented. Skip this and find the one that stars Doris Day. At least you have a real comedy and professional dance!
