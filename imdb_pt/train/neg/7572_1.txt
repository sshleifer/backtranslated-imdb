It seemed like I watched this movie thousands of times before. It was absolutely predictable. Every time the story tried to get a little distorted, every time I expected something interesting to happen, I did not see anything beyond what I expected. Like "The bread factory opened another facility because there was not enough bread." In two words: Simple story, which became a clich√©, bad acting, bad special effects ... Only the Russian cop, Vlad, was a little funny while punishing the bad guys. The muscle heap was incredibly stupid, which made me laugh at him for a moment. I wonder why I waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-movie ... It will not get any worse (because it's not possible): D
