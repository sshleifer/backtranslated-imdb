I think I've found the most misogynist film of all time: Darklight. The essence of the movie Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because it was considered Adam's. equal and refused to submit to it. Look, I took those words straight from the script. So the film goes on and though she is the heroine of the movie, the only time she becomes acceptable is when she does what men tell her to do! She finishes the movie under the control of The Faith - an all male group! <br /> <br /> In addition, the script was predictable and the FX was horrible. In addition to the obvious hatred of females, which is usually much more subtle in modern cinema, there was nothing original about Darklight.
