This little show is obviously a bit of stupid prequel / spin-off from the original series. <br /> <br /> In comparison to the live action series this show sucks. The live action show had clever jokes and stories. While the animated series is basically a bittersweet version attenuated for younger viewers to digest, but I think maybe kids will hate this crap. <br /> <br /> The plot in every episode is basically just Sabrina has a stupid and pointless dilemma and she uses magic to fix it. This is basically the idea of ​​each episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. Then, Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes the courage to become her slave. This then leads to a bizarre but rather interesting scene where Gem says "just adore me for now" and Harvey knelt down and started kissing his feet like a god. (which is for sure since he is his slave to mind control) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or the effort.
