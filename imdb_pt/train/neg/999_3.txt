I saw 'Descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a big disappointment. Disappointment because the plot was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate film was thrilling and being a fan (sounds perverted, I'm not!) From '70s rape / revenge films, I was unnecessary to say very curious to check out this movie. My conclusion: let's stick to the classics! Yes, the plot has potential, but the dialogues are flat, the actors not convinced. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that it is a correct representation of the university world in the USA, that the emptiness of the characters serves a purpose and all that jazz, but that makes the whole movie insubstantial. Just like the scene where Dawson is raped: seriously lacking intensity! I was not expecting anything like 'Irreversible', but still, should not we feel compassion for her? I did not do. Not for a minute, she got so stupid to the end ;-) And I read that the photograph was impressive. Well, it's good, but nothing innovative either. I must admit that the screening at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the movie, I just could not stop thinking, 'I feel like watching Argento's' Hell' again. I laughed a lot. More seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully filmed and I had the bitter feeling of watching a longer, boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the American-Canadian border on Lynch's 'Twin Peaks - Fire Walk' with Eu ... the red and blue lighting, the heavy and low music, the general lewd / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just could not get into that movie. What a pity.
