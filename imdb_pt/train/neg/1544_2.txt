I think I laugh twice. The line where the main character says something about being from the streets. And then I forget the other time I laughed. It probably was in the beginning. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the finest movies of all time. Hollywood does not realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad, in fact. You can only insult yourself so often. <br /> <br /> 2/10
