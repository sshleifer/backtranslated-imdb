This is a case of a lot of people who think they are so smart that they have a story that fits in time. Remember the general political conspiracies captured on the cameras in the years leading up to Watergate and a little later? Most movies that try to make money with "so powerful, so numbing" conspiracies on TV were, in fact, caught up in their own attitude of looking at the navel. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of The Conversa, which I find to be as dated as other conspiracies of the day, but Coppola was loyal to his main character and Hackman was a very interesting actor to watch. I mean, these conspiracy movies are drowning in the character set of the heroes noir. Lots of unanswered questions, a lot of miscommunication ... Well, that leads at least Bergman to building a non-visual film. The next man is a perfect example of his time: a political soup served with an idealistic character and a horrible conspiracy squeezing its web around him. No part is interesting in itself and the whole does not improve. In fact, you can tell just how bad it will be since the very first sequences accumulating 'watcha that' murders without ever advancing any plot. Pedestrian direction at its worst as most of the film is a pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the eyes of the viewer.
