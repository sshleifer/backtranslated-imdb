IMDb guidelines state that you must state whether your comments contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, this whole movie is kind of a spoiler ... a cautionary tale that glorifies what it warns against, a tale of lost youth that does not know where it's headed. <br /> I just saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival. this movie was not only bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> The acting is inconsistent, the characters are the most cliche offers with shallow depth, and the acting of farnsworth was very bad in particular. <br /> <br /> From paternalistic accents to meaningless plot, to out-of-place 'graphic' elements, to dialogue and to repetitive scenarios ... it sucked the big one. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for a more daring and up-to-date 'cowboy cowboy' with a touch of 'natural killers', but he is not as sensitive to the characters as the first and not where so shocking ( out of some blood of brotherhood) as to the ladder. <br /> <br /> Most of all, someone really needed A) edit the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things to build and clearly <br /> <br /> offers with a worthy subject ... if you get stoned in your attempt.) B) Edit the movie. if reduced to a core, may be acceptable. <br /> <br /> I would go below 1 if I could ... like maybe zero kelvin.
