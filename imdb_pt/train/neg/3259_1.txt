Fantastically putrid. I do not want to say above that only a few people should avoid "Doc Savage". Almost all demographic groups would get bored with this trivial production of TV movie quality. It's a bit like the TV series "Batman" from the 60's, except that's not funny. Even accidentally. You better take a nap.
