To heighten the drama of this maternity ward story, it is set in a special ward for "difficult cases." The main story is by Loretta Young; she is on leave for a long period of imprisonment for manslaughter. Will the doctors save their baby at the cost of their life or will they heed their husband's request? The melodrama and the feeling are dominant, and they are not of the honest kind, to say the least. For example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psychological ward right next to the maternity ward, and leaves a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wandering for stealing babies. There's enough laughter and sarcasm to make it recognizable as a Warner movie, especially Glenda Farrell, who drinks gin from her hot water bottle while hoping to have twins who, to her chagrin, find out that now there is a law against the sale. An example of your reply: "Be careful". Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon is, of course, wonderfully authoritative as a head nurse, but do not expect her to have a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone into porridge. . Even given the obvious limitations, this movie should have been better than it is.
