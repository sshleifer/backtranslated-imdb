Exactly what you would expect from a B. Nude movie, free nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous blood and cheesy special effects. Of course it could have been better, better acted (better) written, directed, etc. But then I guess it would not have been a B movie. The actors pretty much sucked, actually, it pretty much looked like an episode of buffy, the vampire slayer or something except with lots of blood, swearing and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis should be highlighted. She is absolutely the queen of the cry of the new millennium. Not that acting really matters in these films, but she was better than any of the other actors. She's also very hot, in that plastic jump suit thing she wore throughout the movie - wow! Your back is absolutely gorgeous in this outfit, I mean every time she turns around, you can help but see her. And near the end of the movie, the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely naked. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a fan of weaker horror movies (like me), check this out. If not, you should probably avoid it at all costs.
