Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture) is an attractive and friendly woman, overcrowded by a smart-eyed teenager, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a stingy husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both boringly self-centered and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> This was heralded as a disturbed family pursued by a mad killer during a ruthless storm. <br /> <br /> The storm does not happen until about the last 5 minutes of the movie, and so it's nothing to send someone running into the storm's hold. <br /> <br /> The chase, similarly, does not get intense until almost the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie we spent listening to Jill and her unbearable daughter, Liv, argue until I just wanted to hit her daughter again next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv is that she has taken on Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly catching up - in fact, Jill comes home to find the two in Liv's bed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband, Sean, or whimpering at Jill or the criticism. Sean was not attractive - since his face is so covered with freckles you could play to connect the dots. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Jill being notified of a bill on her credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she felt that Sean had never been to either. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner and manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very good, older, divorced man who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he sees her husband again, he calls Jill and sends her away. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel and sees Sean with another woman. She is upset, leaves without Sean seeing her and does absolutely nothing. In fact, she does not even say anything to Sean when he gets home. It did not make sense to me. <br /> <br /> Jill gave Richard his business card, and so he calls her and she is apparently in the real estate market. She shows you a condo. Then they have a drink, and things get cozy between them. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill are doing it, hot and heavy. In fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly chooses to cut. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have a showdown on their cheating. Sean laments how Jill has let him down since his father died. Apparently, her lack of any morals is all her fault. Eventually, Jill confesses her own lack of morale and almost adultery with Sean - and of course it's all her fault as far as Sean is concerned. <br /> <br /> The little family decides to go to a camp- which means more to mourn and complain among them, especially the spoiled daughter. <br /> <br /> I was cheering so hard for the stalker to get everyone, but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
