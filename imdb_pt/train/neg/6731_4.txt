Unlike another critic, I think this is well written, especially the more fictitious it is, because it would require more imagination; and well-represented, because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozens of minutes plus well-done monologues. But I just do not entertain with those solemn and pious recollections. Everyone has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everyone has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten stories and problems not very atypical, exemplifying how the life of any person (or part of it) is the basis for the cinema. So again, I think the worst of reality TV shows as well. So if this is your purse, you might like that. It's the kind of thing that would make good gossip over the phone and / or the internet; but absolutely no action other than verbal. And while each of the speakers is female, I'll leave the genre out of it.
