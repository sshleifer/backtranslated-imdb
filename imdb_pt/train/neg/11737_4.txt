Well, I do not think the picture is as bad as most of the comments make it out to be. . . but there is no denying that it has problems. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the problems are in the script. There is a plot - but not much history, and certainly not something anyone could call plausible; trots any number of characters, lines, moments, what you have and, in the end, does not have much importance in that department. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I could not care less about any "social disease" that Farnsworth might be trying to address; there will always be a section of the population willing to do anything to destroy their brains, even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia, or whatever those idiots do. So, like a movie, you're not going to find me calling "Iowa" a "major." But on a stylistic level, the image is more than interesting and some of Farnsworth's choices in portraying the perverted state of a meth are pretty, hilarious, disturbing, and - yes, I'll say - inspired. The acting is uneven, but this can only be a fluke of the previously praised stylistic reach. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a good actress - but she's not very good here, so a discerning audience member has to ask, "What happened?" It is strange that Diane Foster achieves a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can get close to. For example, I could seriously consider any explanation that Farnsworth might provide for Michael T. Weiss's over-the-top shift as a probation officer, but I doubt he bought it; It just does not work. <br /> <br /> So again, it's the most alive and the moment I've seen John Savage show up in years. So go ahead. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of work that haunts, but it does not promise - and that's okay; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make films. So whether Farnsworth has another film or not, it still needs to be seen, but if it does, it seems very likely not to be insipid. At a time when people are planning their lives around the latest episode of "American Idol," we could perhaps allow, not despise, Farnsworth's legitimate and undeniably flawed film. <br /> <br /> Moreover, perhaps we could welcome, not rebuke, his energetic and sometimes blissfully idiosyncratic imagination.
