I really wanted to love this show. I sincerely, truly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers have their own version of "The Bachelor." With the help of his obligatory "witch", Andra, James, a good-looking man in his mid-thirties, has the chance to love 15 suitors (or "mates", as mentioned in the program). The only problem is that half of them are straight and James does not know that. If James chooses a gay, they make a trip to New Zealand, and if he chooses a heterosexual, the direct guy gets $ 25,000. How can this not be fun? Take my hand, let's walk: <br /> <br /> The most glaring problem with this show is the bachelors themselves. James is the typical young, successful gay guy with a nice smile and body, the one you'd probably take two looks at at your local bar before you graze for greener pastures. Why they chose to cast James as the main man is beyond me. God knows there are so many other hottest, lively homosexual men who are dying to be on TV. <br /> <br /> In addition to his medium physical appearance, James is as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even so, he has this arrogant and condescending aura about him. However, if James was standing against an empty white wall, he would mingle in it. I honestly can not remember an interesting or noteworthy thing that James said during the show. He is boring and forgettable. In fact, one of the companions warned that he was not feeling connected. I thought it was the best part of the show. In addition, James speaks with an annoyingly irritating cadence. Female sound or male sound, but there are no voice tracks in the middle of sentences ... so painful to sit. I hated him so much throughout the show that I kept thinking, "Please pick a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your ugly witch." So we have the suitors. A bunch of remarkably bland men who seem not to care what is happening. Equally tasteless, they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the other, except: "Hey, that guy has blond reflexes or, oh, that one has curly hair" Again, surprisingly unappealing cast decisions seem to be the goal of this show. Although it may be banal to type cast roles, it would have been a lot more fun to watch than these amorphous drones. However, in all their banality they still manage to overshadow James (which is not so difficult to do anyway), a little that is. You know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leader. And the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun with each other than with the protagonist? Very sad. <br /> <br /> In addition, I just thought I pointed out something mentioned in the message boards that I felt was true: straight men are all hotter than gays. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying that all gay people are ugly and boring, in fact I found some of them very cute. It's just that overall they were just BLAH compared to the men you'd see at shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I hit it fast during this show. I can accept a main character as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the mundane, apathetic suitors, but PLEASE, for God's sake, entertain me a little. No such luck. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting drama, intrigue, sensuality or excitement, you will ALWAYS be disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the suitors can still have a boyfriend in New York (How scandalous!). As exciting as that may be, I assure you, it's the ONLY thing that remotely remembers any conflict in this show. <br /> <br /> Of course there's a twist, but if you have some Gaydar look on you, you'll be easy to distinguish who's who (it was not hard at all, I was only wrong once). This show is piling up many of your chips with the twist of not delivering anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We watched James & Co walk through these exciting activities, such as learning to dance the West Pass, buy gifts, visit a zoo and gay karaoke. TO YAWN. Of course you have the occasional topless dance, but who cares when everyone is boring anyway. This is one of the main problems with the show: NOBODY seems to be having fun - they are there just passing the movement trying hard to seem to have a good time. And you really can not blame them, since the events are all uncontrollably unimaginable and lame. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect is not there. No caresses, no caresses, no kisses (!), No kind of affection. It's just that "Okay, this was a boring date, I'm going back to my home in Sydney Operahouse, Ugly Face and Sticky (Fast Poked Lips) CYA". This show is so fucked up, it's ridiculous. I can understand them, not wanting to show the indiscriminate nature of homosexual men, but it comes to the surface. People who watch reality shows will want more than hugs and short kisses. This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if this was long winded, but I felt that these were issues that needed to be addressed. I congratulate Bravo for first showing such a spectacle, but the incredibly incompetent manner in which this program was treated is incomprehensible. To sum up my three points: boring + boring + boring = will do something else. You will have more fun waiting in a doctor's office for an appointment, at least they have interesting magazines there.
