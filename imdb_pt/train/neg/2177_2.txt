The first notable problem about this clumsy movie is its cast. Ann Nelson plays Grandma here. Three years later, she would star in "Airplane!" like the woman who hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays pine by Julie Hagerty. I could not get this image out of my head. <br /> <br /> Matt Boston has been in trouble for fifteen years. He has headaches. His mother had a nervous breakdown. Your grandfather had a massive heart attack. A smoker psychiatrist decides to find out what the hell is going on with this family. First she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson. Nelson tells a flashback story that fills the entire first half of the movie. <br /> <br /> She and Grandpa bought a cheap trailer, and they drove him to all the tourist traps in the California desert. The RV soon has a mind of his own, getting off the road and such. Then big boulders begin to launch against her. The elderly couple is afraid, but stays in the vehicle to move the plot. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the grandfather has a heart attack after getting trapped in the roof of the trailer when he leaves for another unplanned ride. <br /> <br /> Boston's mother begins to talk to some of the native American mummies she has at home. She considers herself an author and writes copiously about the musty corpses. The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes and uses his imagination to fill in the blanks. We see the mother semi-flip-out, but her mental breakdown occurs off-screen, much like the Gramps heart attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, the endurance patient, little Matt. Matt goes under the weapon of hypnosis and tells his own story. He thinks his mother is leaving (this was done in 1977). Apparently, the mother is causing the astral bodies of the native American mummies to fly through the air. One hits Matt as a bee hits the windshield, and Matt starts acting totally crazy. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt to the desert. Matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair now, and the trio faces the invisible (and inexplicable) forces. <br /> <br /> Flocker has no sense of scene construction. One pro here involves the RV stranded in a salar in the desert. In the distance, the couple noticed some pebbles rolling toward the trailer. This is a small and scary scene that is eventually overdone. When the boulders begin to play toward the vehicle, the special effects become obvious. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the trailer leaves the road, then it works again, it takes an eternity. The scenes where Grandpa is trapped in the trailer's roof as he descends a dirt road takes forever. Mom's conversations with the mummy last forever. Experiences outside of Matt's body last forever. This movie takes forever. <br /> <br /> I was tempted to push the fast forward button at least a dozen times. As the scenes dragged on, it was obvious that Flocker was filling. Cut the fat here, and that would have scored in an hour. The final "explanation" that the mummy spirits were trying to kill those close to Matt never drew water. Did they live in the RV? The filmmaker never mentions the fact that spirits are not good in their murderous ways, they never kill anyone! As I kept thinking of Nelson in "Airplane!", I also thought of other movies. . Anything to keep me from falling asleep during this. Boston is terrible as the boy, playing a fifteen year old as a ten year old who has a smart line for all those adults who fall in love with him. <br /> <br /> In the end, Flocker wrote: and directed a mess. The title is just the beginning of this exercise to make the public feel uncomfortable. This is not scary, and like ghosts, you too can walk ... away from this tape in the store. <br /> <br /> This is not evaluated, and contains some physical violence and slight profanity.
