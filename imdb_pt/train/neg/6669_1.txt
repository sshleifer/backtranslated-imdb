I saw this movie in my movie class. I'm glad I did not pay to see. I walked in with an open mind and got a little excited. I really like Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I've never connected with this movie. The acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the plot, or rather, the lack of it, was a problem. There was no central theme intertwined with the film. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a Westerner? More or less, but no. I'm all for twists on movies, I recently saw "Brick" and loved it, but the place this movie was was a lot out there. It was so strange, and if I had not been forced to watch the whole movie, I would have left. The writing was not terrible, but it was just everywhere. When the movie was over, I was terribly confused and wishing it was over earlier. There was something about this movie that did not resonate, I understand more non-standard films like "Fight Club", but I just did not care about the characters.
