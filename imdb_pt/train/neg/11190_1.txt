First of all, I have to say that I worked for blockbuster and saw many movies to the point that it is difficult for me to find something that I have not seen. Taking that into account, I want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst movie ever made, that made me cheer for Gigli, my Boss's Daughter, and any other piece of crap you've ever seen. BeLyt must be out of his mind, I just met a person who liked it and even they could not tell me about what the movie was. If you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it is, you have to be the writer or a fortune teller because there is another way for a person to figure it out. <br /> <br /> FOR THE LOVE OF GD STAY AWAY!
