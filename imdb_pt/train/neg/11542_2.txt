An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and terribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psychopaths during a nightly meeting on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who were attacked plan and carry out a revenge attack against their aggressors ... <br /> <br /> Totally repulsive voyeuristic garbage, somehow disguising itself as a "thought-provoking" drama, while in the truth appears as sub-Michael Winner cr * p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been chosen had they been made easily in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is terrifying and devastating, but Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose in every drop of his sexual wickedness. His camera lingers eagerly on Anderson's naked body during and after the attack, while the script leaves almost every character struggling in a turgid sea of ​​two-dimensional cliche. His script compels his characters to behave in a way that takes the viewer away from the "victims," ​​putting on more horrifying situations (Adams' attempt to attack Sophie and Alice; Alice's attack on Heffer after his suicide.) The dilemma comes from the performances of the central protagonists - Dyer is a horrible actor, incapable of light and shadow as the young male victim of the initial attack (he will end up in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary.Even though the atrocious script forces his character to behave in depraved and ridiculous ways, it somehow offers an extraordinarily convincing and complicated characterization as a self-indulgent and arrogant hedonist who finds such horrors and needs to retaliate. A vile and meaningless film, then, almost but not totally rescued by a central female performance.
