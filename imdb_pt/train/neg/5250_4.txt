I absolutely love the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I learned that a movie based on the book was being made. <br /> <br /> But I was seriously disappointed in the film when I saw why it did not capture what I loved in the book - Erica's absolutely ridiculously funny and the interesting way she sees the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, I realized that things are not the same as I imagined in the book. So I just went along for the ride. It was not so bad, I guess. Miss Belmont was totally different from what I thought she was! I do not think she would be a person to smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays her, is hilarious! <br /> <br /> On its own, I thought the film and its actors did a good job. work, but unfortunately I'm so fan of the book (one of my all time favorite books) that I could not help but feel disappointed = P
