Cast to die in a movie that is considerably smaller. Vanessa Redgrave is dying, but before she leaves, she begins to tell the daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that has the looks and expectations of be a great movie simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it, so it seems to be something different than the potboiler that it really is. Not bad as such but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all giving good performances), you expect more than a tearful storyline is a bit more than a harlequin novel. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable.
