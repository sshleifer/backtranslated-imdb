The Cat O'NINE HUNT (Il Gatto a Nine Code) <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A former blind journalist (Karl Malden) hears a conspiracy to blackmail a genetic research lab and then joins a fellow reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murder in the laboratory, inadvertently placing his loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer. <br /> <br /> Hastened in production after the unexpected worldwide success of his debut directing THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PENGUAGE (1969), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE Tails as a giallo-thriller in the same vein as his predecessor, highlighting celebrated Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GANG). Unfortunately, the resulting film - which the ads claimed to be "nine times more suspenseful" than "Bird" - is a disappointing accompaniment, impeccably photographed and elegantly executed, but very laborious and aimless for general consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer uses the ample Cromoscope frame to convey the high-tech world in which Argento's black heart scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving the star of Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE), as the romantic interest of Franciscus, is little more than an unnecessary fill. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin at a crowded train station (edited with elegant assurance by the faithful actor Franco Fraticelli), and a nightly episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important lane inside a tomb and die of hunger. the tortuous machinations of the killer. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the movie wanders aimlessly from scene to scene, boiling gently without ever boiling. It's no surprise that "Cat" has failed to emulate the great success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
