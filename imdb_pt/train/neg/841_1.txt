I watched this movie 15 minutes ago and I still have no idea what I just saw. Mostly I think it's a movie about an internet S & M "star" of CD Roms that are as realistic as online flash cartoons. She is murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a team of 2 FBI agents to investigate her death. The local homicide division of Big City, USA, is also investigating, although most of its work comes from navigating CD-ROMs, which it claims are as realistic as the real thing. I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie who has some kind of credit behind him. He's been in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of it is hitting the main girl seemingly for no apparent reason. I will not even explain the ending, because frankly I can not figure it out myself. But before the final scene, we are treated to a montage of 3 or 4 minutes of everything in the film. Honestly, they could have run that final scene and it would have been the same effect with the angry direction and all. <br /> <br /> In all, stay away from this movie. I understood why I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used this a few minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. Like, playing that game with a knife where you strike your hand repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be a lot more fun.
