What a horrible movie. I love monster movies, but I could not watch even half the terrible acting, cardboard characters and abysmal special effects. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The characters come from an endless supply of stupidly suicidal cannon fodder, or else they are half empty and uninspired puppets. The plot is stereotyped, cut and paste, standard science-run-amok drivel. Even the CGI is awful. You know it's bad when you can not even depend on the film to provide a good eye drop. No surprise here, just same old same old. This is actually one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman should be hung on a lamppost so the kids can use it as a pi√±ata.
