In reviewing this movie, I can only follow my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July, August, and September 1971 at that garden of the Earth, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was nothing like I remember basic training. <br /> <br /> But one must remember that at the time it was Korea, which ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew it. It was not Vietnam, a guerilla war in the jungle, where we continued pouring out recruits into an endless pit. The draft at that time was not welcome, but accepted as still necessary for the country's defense. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea who is now assigned to train troops to go abroad. The film is about one of his training cycles and the platoon men he has to train. They are the usual type you would find in just about any war movie of the previous decade. One thing I will praise Take the High Ground is the fact that MGM acknowledged that our army was now integrated with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. This was in keeping with the spirit of changing times. <br /> <br /> But I'm going to say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of his clever mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would not have risked death or become a eunuch to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon. And no way would he have worried so much about Robert Arthur defecting. He just let the MPs deal with it. <br /> <br /> Of course being shot at Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas gave Take the High Ground a good authenticity. But watch this as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave the cooperation back in the day. <br /> <br /> I remember the sergeants having their little conflicts you could catch when you were not worried that they would accept your case for something that was 95 percent of the time. But there is no way Karl Malden beat Widmark during training, in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that they would have undermined authority, something the military simply does not let happen. <br /> <br /> I wish I had said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like your talented cast, it's the talented director Richard Brooks, even the silly theme of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh out of his Oscar a year earlier to High Noon. The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and a story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been for Kaufman's vivid imagination.
