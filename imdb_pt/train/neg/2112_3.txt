Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife young and beautiful. To this end, he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make them look like they are dead so he can steal their bodies. I do not know exactly what he does with bodies. I do not remember ever being fully explained. All I know is that he extracts something from them and injects into his wife. (I just think it's spinal fluid.) Spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 1940s.) You may well guess the rest of here. <br /> <br /> There's a couple (well, much more than a couple, but I'll write about only two) problems I have with this movie. One is the way Bela is used. Of course, he does a decent enough job in his own kind of exaggerated way (BTW, the rest of the cast is simply abysmal). But having him tucked away in the back of a hearse or having him invade the reporter's room for nothing, is simply silly. Besides, why did he beat and / or killed all the henchmen he has? Is it to make it look bad? Well, someone who is kidnapping brides in a coma really does not need to look more evil. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​drugging brides. Why brides? Would not any woman under 20 years old? Watching Bella go through these twists and turns to get her victims, I remembered the idiot Fisherman in I still know what you did last summer. In each case, there seems to be an easier way to achieve your goal than employing a seemingly impossible plan, which depends heavily on circumstances beyond your control. (BTW, an alternate title for this movie is The Case of the Missing Brides. I think this partly explains the need for 'brides').
