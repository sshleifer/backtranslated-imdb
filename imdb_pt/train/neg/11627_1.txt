I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The jokes would not have worked for Gilligan's Island. Had this gone to series, would there have been jokes about Auschwitz, or would Eva have to replace her oven, just so Adolf would suggest the guy who would fit 50? Another post compared this show to I love Lucy. The problem is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedies and bizarre situations, and this mess was simply poorly made and an insult to my intelligence. After the damage the Nazis did to England and the number of people they killed, I would think that the very concept of comedy about Hitler would seem disgusting, and most ordinary people would have killed that concept before any episode was produced.
