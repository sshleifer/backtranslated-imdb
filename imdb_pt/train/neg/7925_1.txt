Want a great recipe for failure? Take a good plan, add some weak, completely undeveloped characters and play the worst special effects a horror movie has ever known. Let it cook for a week (the amount of time probably spent doing this rubbish). The result is "Corpse Grinders," a film that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic places. <br /> <br /> The movie spoiled everything. My words can not convey how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit and make fun of. This is not the plane of outer space. This is a long, boring and sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. I get depressed when I realize that people really take time out of their lives to act in that shit if you can call it acting. But once again, when you have a bad direction, a bad writer, everything bad, acting is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a big, disgusting crap that you crave for quickly ejecting from existence. , afraid that a friend or loved one could somehow see it. I really could somehow destroy all copies of this movie, so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me a new respect for all the movies I've seen. You have shown me what is really horrible and why should I enjoy all those movies that are merely bad or boring.
