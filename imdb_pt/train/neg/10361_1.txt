This direct failure of ABC does not do any justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults to a magical world, fantastic and original as no author before it. This novel, the first in its "time quartet," is a beautiful vision of life, the universe and time itself. However, it is easy for any child or teenager to understand. His unswerving morality prevails throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen as nothing more than a mockery of the work of art of Ms. L'Engle. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects seem cheap and ridiculous, the plot is mole and uneven, the dialogue is exaggerated and almost all the magical features of the novel have been lost. This was a horrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day an intelligent and dignified director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates and Alfonso Cuar√≥n) will make another attempt to take this book to the screen and understand what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to the flat, fake and cheap art of a motel room, which has no basis and absolutely no impact on its public.
