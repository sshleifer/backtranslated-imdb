Sistas on the hood. Looking for revenge and bling bling. Except the hood is a wild west town in the late 1800's. I do not remember any western like that when I was growing up. What would Randolph Scott say? If he saw Lil 'Kim, he might say, "Okay, I have to admit I tuned in just to see her." Empty bellies and low-cut sweaters are not the basic item in the cowboy movie, but these are the cowgirls, and they're fine. <br /> <br /> Now, do not go looking for any major stories here, and the usual things about the ghetto criminal drama are here in a different setting. you heard John? Wayne calls someone, "Dawg"? And, I do not remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they march to OK Corral. <br /> <br /> I watch it on BET, so I lost the action that happened.It's a R rating, but I doubt I'll buy the DVD to see it unless you can be sure it was Lil 'Kim in that action.
