(Spoilers galore) This is an absolutely horrible movie. First of all there's that average guy. I think he made a career out of playing gifted parents. Okay, the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but 10 minutes later, they did it again. And so it goes, this movie moves in excruciating real time. At one point, I began to imagine this was days later, until I remembered that the story line was just the next day ... in the early afternoon yet! I'm not sure who this couple should be in real life. First of all they are presented as a kind of yuppie couple from Manhattan who grew up and had a child. But they drive an old blue Volvo. These guys stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today they drive Prius. But in 2002, I'm sure they were not even piloting Volvos. <br /> <br /> OK, so there's Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a small magic statue of Wendigo and tells him his powerful magic. Come on ... are we still making old Indian mysteries? Just to take you home, they go through every Indian statue in their tourist town in upstate New York. The American Indians are portrayed in a way not seen for decades in this movie! Oh, and about Wendigo. He is not really the cause of horror. He does not kill the boy's father, which is the most horrible thing in the movie ... he is killed by a common horsewoman with rancor and a high-powered rifle. Wendigo only comes out at the end of the movie to avenge the guy who killed his father ... oh, but wait, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was a little angry with his father, maybe because he killed a deer ... so Wendigo must have stayed happy that the father was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> And so it goes ... insulting, boring and meaningless. There's no reason to watch this movie.
