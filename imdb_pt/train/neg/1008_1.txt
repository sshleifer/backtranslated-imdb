The 'Edison' plot was decent, but one particular actor ruined the entire movie. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with all the lines he uttered during the film. He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and must face the same fate of the entire F.R.A.T. platoon. Whether it's an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake has managed to ruin him. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this movie. Do not even bother downloading it, dwarf porn would be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you're reading this, stay with the music. Even if you're not good at it, you've done a wonderful job of deceiving people, making them think you can really sing.
