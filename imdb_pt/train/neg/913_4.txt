Okay now, let's see. What was funny about the first movie? I know, people with funny accents, people falling in the water, silly boat shots and funny comments between the two teams. In this movie they twisted the accent piece to the max, not good. A lot of people are falling in the water for uncertain reasons, not good. Boatcrash, check it out. Funny comments between the two teams, they tried, but failed. In addition, there are also personalities that they are following in this film. This movie should be about what is happening in the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that there are very far between the funny parts and the film's sponsors are exploited to the fullest. Nothing good. All in all, I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts.
