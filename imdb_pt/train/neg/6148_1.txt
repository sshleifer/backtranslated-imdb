Firstly, the film was not true to the facts. I just saw the documentary a few days before and the movie was nothing like it. First of all, Nash was a math genius and that's how the movie should be, not a story about a man who was healed and who found love in the end and so on. There are also many scenes that were simply wrong - the scene where he rode a bike on campus happened in his early college years, not after her. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not fit that part, since he does not look like the smart / individualistic type, so he really could not play one. It would have been great if it had focused more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not on super-dramatized lovelife. At that level, the ABM was too hollywoodian and too shallow to be great. Personally, I do not think he was crazy or paranoid and he was into something, since people of that caliber tend to know more than we do "minor mortals." 5/10
