First of all, let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a review for this movie. The best criticism for this kind of Cinema may be just silence. Movie directed at housewives and grandmothers. This movie tries to sound "genuine" and the characters must be "real people". An Italian could never think that the characters could be "real": they are just "low profile" stereotypes. It gives a very bad view of what life is like inside Italy. The plot is weak (plot? What plot?) And humor does not make anyone over 12 years old laugh.
