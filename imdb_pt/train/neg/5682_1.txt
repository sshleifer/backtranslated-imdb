This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is the worst I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of blood, but most of the killings in this movie are not shown. It just shows us the bodies already dead, and the only death scenes they show in this movie are terrible. The graphics look so obviously fake. The actors are terrible too. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this movie, but I had to submit to actual animal scenes being beaten during the beginning of the movie. If I could rate it at -10, I would. F * ck this movie. It's crap. <br /> <br /> Do not watch.
