I do not have much to say about this movie. It could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for Peter Sellers, but it's one of the most tragic failures in movie history. That was Sellers' final film makes it even more painful. <br /> <br /> The terrible script, directing and shocking wooden performances all come together terribly to make this one of the most horribly horrible movies ever. I wish I could find even a giggle or a laugh somewhere in this putrid fat pile, but it's a lifeless, humorless disaster. Truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why could not you have stopped by to be there?
