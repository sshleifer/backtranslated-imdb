I saw and liked the original movie, and expected more of a remake than that. <br /> <br /> BOA: Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the score and visual, they are adequate, and the performances were ok (Tim Roth was excellent, the other directors were fine, and a handful of "supporting actors" did very well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were thrilling and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: The escape from the monkey city was terrible. The characters are walking in circles, and suddenly, somewhere in the middle of the city, there are tunnels to escape. Besides, which escape route passes through everyone's room? <br /> <br /> History has been reduced to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes, but the original movie had more flesh for it and deserved more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the ending was completely meaningless as presented. Without seeing the inevitable sequence, there is no justification for this. <br /> <br />
