Drones, ethnic drums, bad synthesizer, children singing. The most paternalistic world music imaginable. This is a tourist movie and a lousy one. What really kills them is the incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc., etc. No transitions, no visual explanation of why we're suddenly ten thousand miles away, with no ideas expressed in images. Just a bunch of third-party images with "baskets on their heads" as another reviewer said. Walking without stopping as if this had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a videoclip of the 3rd world, all they had to do was go a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were filmed and filmed in Mexico. That would have been a much better scenario for "life changing". <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided was a scrambled tourist route that covered half the globe and filter filters loaded by the mind. The only thing to recommend this movie is that it does not suck as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
