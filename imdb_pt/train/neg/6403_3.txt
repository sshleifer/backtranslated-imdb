.... as to the level of intelligence in which this comedy operates. Almost never reaching the size of the feature, "Can I Do It .... 'till I Need Glasses' is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short you can not believe it when you realize that it should be the joke (example: Santa's gag); others are so long you can not believe it when you realize they needed so much time to put together that joke (example: the joke of student awards). And almost all are directed without any artistic skill. Do not get me wrong: about 1 in 10 jokes really succeeds in being funny (the iron / telephone phone is probably my favorite). There is also a wonderful full frontal nudity that proves, once again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is also some comical male nudity). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually very captivating! But none of these reasons is enough to give this film anything beyond * 4.
