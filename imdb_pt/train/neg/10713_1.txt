Come on, let's get real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi or the Knights Templar, as they are most commonly called, did not exist until the beginning of the twelfth century. The story is so ridiculous that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. And besides, if you wanted to have a real-life Templar, why not just use the Knights of Christ, who still exist in Portugal. At least they should have taken the story into account. The only redeeming quality I could find in this film was that the artifacts seemed authentic enough to go through pieces from the medieval or Gothic period. The acting was poor, the plot terrible, the action horrible, and the props were fine.
