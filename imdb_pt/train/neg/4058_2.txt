From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. It's so full of cliches that your typical NRA member will not even like this movie. I give 2 out of 10, just because of William Benton's acting. I can not believe people voted 6+ for this movie. He is so inclined to a "certain point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born evil. Neither are born well. They are born with a clean slate. It is society, parents, and education, which makes them who they are. And if they take the wrong course, somewhere down the line, it certainly will not be the American penal system that puts them back on track! Either way, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than to waste it on that crap. <br /> <br />
