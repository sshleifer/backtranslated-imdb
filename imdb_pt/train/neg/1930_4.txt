Some have praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as a Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least not to think about adults. <br /> <br /> This script suggests a beginning as a live action movie that caught someone's eye as the kind of crap you can no longer sell to adults. The "crack team" of many old adventure films was made well before (think of "The Dirty Dozen"), but "Atlantis" represents one of the worst films on the subject. The characters are weak. Even the backdrop that each member displays appears as a stock and clumsy at best. An MD / Medicine Man, a boy mechanic whose father always wanted children, if we have not seen them before, we've already seen the peculiarities of mixing and combining before. The story about how a fellow Vinny played Don Novello (Br. Guido Sarducci) went from flower shops to totally unconvincing demolitions. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young academic obsessed with Atlantis. voiced by Michael J. Fox, has some depth to it. Milo's quest for Atlantis remains that of his grandfather who created him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo perched on one knee while his grandfather puts his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were fine at best, the best part about _Atlantis_ was the voice. talent. Perhaps the depth of Milo is not thicker than the charm of Fox. Commander Rourke does not lose anything being voiced by James Garner. Although Rourke is a rather conservative military type, Garner shows his ability to give life to the characters simply by his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the highlight. I am sorry to say that Leonard Nimoy's King Morse is no more than obligatory. In addition, Don Novello as demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also notable for one or two funny and well-made lines - but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci, anyway. <br /> <br /> Computer Animation was also well done. The BACKGROUND animation, that is. The character animation has not been so bad for Disney since the minimalism that led Don Bluth out the door. Character animation does nothing if it does not make the already flat characters appear smoother. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say banal or banal. I'm not so sure about that. Any useful plot can be transformed into something new with the proper treatment. Shakespeare often began from a well-known story and plot and became famous only for putting on a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the thing. And _Atlantis_ obviously does not have it. <br /> <br /> I can not begin to get into all the logical gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was bad. The plot bridges shake like wires and the ending does not make sense. To add to that, the script and the animation are peppered with annoying sloppiness. 1. Early on, when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols were erroneously transliterated and the "Coast of Ireland" should read " Coast of Iceland ", we started to have problems. The writers of the script would need to meet the British for Eire or Eireann as "Ireland," and completely ignore the old Latin term Hibernia. But more than that, they need to know about the Vikings' conspiracy to call the greener island of Iceland and the icy island of Greenland. In making the question of a "letter" wrong, the writers were doomed to demand a runic version of English and a post-Roman date in the script. Since this is long after Atlantis should have sunk in its underwater cave. And with no visible clues and less technology than Milo, it made the inscription much less reliable. <br /> <br /> 2. The Shepard's Diary could not have been written before the sinking of Atlantis, or would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying "in the eyes of the king." It must have been written after the shipwreck, but without even the technology that Milo's expedition had, how one managed the Leviathan. So how could I know more about anything after that? And why would this be written in Atlantis? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However, clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in Atlantis. So it has to be some kind of automatic writing. Once no one left in Atlantis can read, it must be the spirits of the crystal messages to the surface. That would have made more sense. But it could also have been explained inside the movie: Milo could have discovered that this power was calling him all his life - appeared in dreams, etc. This needed to be explored in the film. <br /> <br /> 3. Atlanteans simply should not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-Europeans to talk in Europe, any more than the Romans would understand that their day or day became "ch" s French (pronounced "sh" s, not less!). 4. The present Atlanteans were alive before the cataclysm - when they could apparently read, but now are unable to read what they used to do or to operate similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. Mass illiteracy points to a crucial flaw in the film. NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture. It seems suspended in the air until Milo can rescue it. Even though it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to compose poetry or write novels and it may be a combination of school systems from Atlantis heading toward the end and lack of good fiction that made Atlantis fall. illiteracy. 5. Kida may be excused for not being able to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the cataclysm of stupidity settled in - but ANY OF YOU ** HARDLY ** qualifies her father for Deification !! The folly of Kashakim almost alone eliminated his people from existence. He killed a pack in the cataclysm, stopped the progress (not much dead here, but he oversaw a huge drop in culture and progress) until one could pick up the crystal to kill everyone if they were not boiled in the lava first because the Giant Robots they were not there to protect them. A ray of blue electricity should have broken the resemblance of Kashakim when Kida tried to unite her father's image to the circle of the GREAT kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> 6. Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of scribbles and find a page on a crystal - that he knew to be a crystal and not some astrological or "stylized" phases. sun. "7. If Milo's grandfather told Rourke about it, it still does not explain how Rourke would have suffered from reading Milo as part of the book. head of Rourke, though Milo found no sign of a torn page in the book - it was only there to warn the viewer that "something was not right." Unless the word "crystal" had alarmed Milo in the head that someone should try <br /> <br /> 8. The double-cross of the crew was not a change of character.We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie have been following Rourke from the beginning, but the "change of heart" falls on the face.It was a change and needed to be better motivated.Hard to do with characters who did not get anything to begin with. 9. It turns out that lava flows up the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area which we see the sequence. It is liquid; will not flow over the protection vault until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> 10. The final STINKS! - and it makes no sense but to appease the political correctness. With its restored power source, Atlantis is no longer a weak power, needing to be pampered. The guardians of the giant robot and the celestial cycles that fire blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they could. The technology is superior to ours and definitely at the beginning of the 20th century. In the end Milo must teach the Atlanteans to read, for what? The idea is to leave your small culture quiet and punished in peace, not send it to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** FINALIZE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Maybe the plot of Lost World and the turn of the century scenario should give me a clue that this is more a tribute to pulps . The shortcomings I encounter with the film agree with this idea. But I'm lost because I should pay to see fine characters and make holes simply because so many novels had them. And cellulose stories are part of the "crap they can not sell grown up" anyway. We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow as well. The Raiders of the Lost Ark have lost none of their flesh and have avoided such wickedness. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is nice, but when I think of the plot, it gets more and more exhausting.
