I had never heard of it before the owner of my local DVD rental company mentioned it to me; Being an 80s horror film with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the UK, I decided to take a look. The film turned out to be a boring, amateur and ugly ride; the sound recording is so weak that the dialogue is unintelligible in half the time, while acting gives a new meaning to the word inept! <br /> <br /> What's worse, the film follows the terribly tired formula of a trio of teenage girls involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote environments. Soon one of the girls will seek help and is never heard again; another, still bedridden, is quickly eliminated (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is the one who most interacts with the three inhabitants of the house: a mother steward who beats the bible (horrible suggestion), her repressed daughter (and suffering) and the odd brother of the latter who occasionally appears to drool over the guests asleep. <br /> <br /> Resorting often to table-top reminiscences made by the mother who hates men (as a means of filling in the sad, not to mention unoriginal history) and invariably turning into dispute disputes between mother and daughter, the film has an ace up its sleeve - the end of the twist is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film (as much as through claudication of everything like intermittent blood) or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time ...
