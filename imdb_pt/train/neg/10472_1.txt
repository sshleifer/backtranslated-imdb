I should have known I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the main character. Words can not describe, nor do they justice to how terrible this movie was. But please allow me to try to describe it: Horrible acting, terrible dialogues, cheesy situations, and through that, you have the feeling of being forced to feed the beliefs and propensities of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a weak attempt to show Hollywood that a movie can be fun and have a deep religious message attached to it. They failed miserably. It was clearly the worst movie I've seen in a long time.
