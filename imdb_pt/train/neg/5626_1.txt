I caught this movie in the tube on a Sunday. I thought it was so bad that I looked in IMDb to see what others thought about it. I was not surprised by how many silly people liked this fluff. However, I was surprised when I looked over the comments to read the Hated It categories only to find they were none. I was shocked by this; I always look at the hated because they are always those who hate a movie, no matter how good it is. Somehow, this movie went unharmed by the enemies I say no and proclaim with pride that I hate this movie! I know I should go into detail about why I hate this movie, but doing it would only give this movie more respect than it deserves.
