I'm working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and THE WITCHES 'MOUNTAIN (El Monte das Brujas) is something like the movie 17 on set. <br /> <br /> The movie had nothing to do with my attention at all. The plot was incoherent. The dialogue seemed improvised. The acting was bad. The characters were unfriendly. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, with an exasperated woman who is driven to burn her seemingly spoiled daughter. However, the only connection that this scene has with the rest of the movie is the main character, Mario, who has the most stubborn mustache of all time. But that's right. <br /> <br /> The film was not effective on any level. The music was very intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It's really badly watchable - what more can I say?
