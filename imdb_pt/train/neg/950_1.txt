I got this movie on AZN by cable. It looked like it would be a good movie, a Japanese "Green Card." I can not say I did not like an Asian movie, quite the opposite. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a big fan of John Woo's Hong Kong movies. I'm not harmful to a lightweight movie theater, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I'd like that. Well, I'd rather cut my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious and ill-depicted movie again. <br /> <br /> I think director Steven Okazaki must have sprinkled water with Quaalude because no one in this movie had a personality. And when any of the characters tried to act, as opposed to grunting a line or two, their performance seemed forced and incredibly fake. I honestly did not think anyone had acted before ... the ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki .. I think it's amazing that this is being promoted as a comedy because I did not laugh once. Even more surprising is that the CBS morning news called it "a refreshing comedy breath." It was neither refreshing nor a comedic breath. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie unless you want to see a predictable and tedious wooden plot. I really think "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a better movie than that ... and I came out in the middle of the movie!
