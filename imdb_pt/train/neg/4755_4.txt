I thought the movie was good in parts. The start was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie were good. The camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and I did not like them because they were not covering the actors entirely. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie were not very good, of which we expect a lot in the case of these films. <br /> <br /> The dialects made no sense and I do not think they were very witty. <br /> <br /> I felt like they were trying to copy movies like phonebooth in terms of dialogues, but they failed miserably. It seemed that many of the scenes between the actors were put to the effect and did not make any sense to the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie features only law and cayman. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was a waste of time, it's an OK movie, but not gr8
