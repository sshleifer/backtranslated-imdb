This movie was at the end of the night when I saw it. It was interesting at first, but it did not convince me as a whole. I'm not a Tyson fan. Actually, I do not like boxing at all. It is barbaric, obscene and double-sided (by society) that some make money by hitting each other. <br /> <br /> However, I felt that the beginning of the film was OK. Actors well, especially George C. Scott (as Cus D'Amato). I do not know how reliable the movie is. I have not read books and books about boxing or Tyson. I do not know anything about the man, but it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> As the film continued, I felt that I lost some of its charm and also lost interest. I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was not good enough.
