This subject deserves a much better script, and end result, than this movie does. The script is full of holes, because it was never intended as a story, but rather a series of loosely interwoven nightmare scenarios. The gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous. The scene in which the kidnapping victim is informed that her parents are not dead and have been looking for her since she was taken is simply bizarre. It is written as a moment of cathartic therapy with the head of the fugitive shelter giving her a "missing poster" of when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of a fugitive shelter discovered that he had a settled abduction under his roof, what he would have followed would be an immediate call to the police. It's a matter of law enforcement not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows to the end is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for purely free exploration. Funny, that's what this movie should be condemning. In the end, it seems to have joined.
