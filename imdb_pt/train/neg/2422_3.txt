This movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes, like a family movie should, and that would not be considered a family anyway, because there are some things kids should not be seeing. It's not the best ABC family movie if you ask me. If there were fewer sexual themes in the movie, maybe it would be better. Hollywood is doing nothing to improve a movie by adding sexual situations. There is really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I would not want to spend my money on this junk by renting it. If you have other things to do besides watching this movie, proceed to them.
