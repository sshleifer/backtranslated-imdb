I've seen goals changed ... twice ... and always the same feeling ... you see the Olsen twins doing the same movie ... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with the boys. Now, about the movie .... in the first place all these little boys and girls do not play with such great goals ... 2.Sports do not play in time outs ... 3. if the game is over, the referee gives a few extra hours (one minute or more) ... and the ending is so expected ... I think this movie is bad because of the lack of knowledge about football ... if it were done by European producers it would be better ... and also the mane actors are not the choice of wright ... they suffer from lack of faith..OK they have played a few seasons in full house but this does not make them big stars .... you have to show your talent. ... and that's what's missing in the Olsen twins
