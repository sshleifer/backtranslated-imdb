This movie must be number one on the bottom 100. The acting is so horrible that when my son and I watched it we almost got physically sick. And the story is worse. I could continue to talk about how bad it is but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to Frankbob's review as I see no one else bothered to do it yet. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thank God, we saw it on TV, so we did not spend anything. If we had, I would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to cast an execration in its general direction. To conclude, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed watching the act of Carrie Fisher. But I'm sad to say that it's not worth watching in this particular movie. Do not spoil your thoughts about Carrie.
