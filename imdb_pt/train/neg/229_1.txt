I picked this up at IFC yesterday and I can not believe the positive comments! Am I the only one who thinks these "ladies" are nothing? Kate tells Jed that she could be fired because she should be a pillar of the community but put it out for him! So they suddenly decide they're in love? And she's so devastated by his death, she's not going to his funeral, let alone telling her family the "good news"! By the way, how did an American become the headmistress of a very appropriate British school? Janine should have been thrown out of the force for her inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she ends up bringing a blow she brought for questioning! And the less talk about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> As for the guilt that Janine and Molly feel about Jed, please! It's the damn punk fault he turned into a hit! Where is the fault of poor Gerald, who gets vomited? If only I could do the same with the bozos behind this "movie"!
