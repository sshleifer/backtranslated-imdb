My thoughts on the movie, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good or good. Visually, it was great. I was satisfied with the rhythm, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? Hey, kind of bland. Plot? He sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie looked more like a new crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science is not portrayed better. Creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? <br /> <br /> This is something that bites my butt a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie ... created with science ... and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters asking, "Okay, so now what?" (or something similar). I could not hear very well because of the crowd immediately getting up and taking a break for the exit. It was a "well ... it was just barely enough fun to sit here for the whole movie, but now let's get out of here ASAP!" output type. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can not think if you want to have fun. Just look at the look and nod your head beautifully. Any thoughts on "what is the purpose of this?" will suck you in disbelief and make you look at the exit sign with longing. <br /> <br /> Okay ... SPOILERS follow. <br /> <br /> So, basically, a scientist creates "the Machine" that is capable of creating another intelligent robotic life. Evil humans use this as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also missing. He gave the Machine his intellect, but did not give his heart. <br /> <br /> The Machine transports Skynet to the collective of humanity and erases all life on Earth, finally slowing down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create half-footed puppets. Each one containing a piece of the scientist's soul. <br /> <br /> The last, # 9 wakes up without knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and catches it. He meets another like himself, # 2. Well, # 2 is captured by the last surviving machine robot. # 9 finds more like himself and goes out to rescue # 2. <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> # 9 realizes that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine returns to life ... withdrawing the soul from # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> The film continues with action scenes with # 9 trying to rescue their countrymen with soul torn out. <br /> <br /> They eventually get and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who rise to the clouds. Then it rains and we see life returning to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> That does not make sense. None at all. Why the hell did the scientist want to divide his soul into 9 homunculi? What did that do? Were they bred to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why to worry?!? <br /> <br /> Why did he expect nine small creatures to succeed when nothing else happened? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight the first ... at least that would have seemed like a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why did they need their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to shut down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps?
