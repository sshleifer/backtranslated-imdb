I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know people will say that the prequel was done on a small budget, but it never had anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe it's just me, but I've always found that a prequel was made to set up the other movie, starring key characters and maybe filling up some of the life we ​​did not know about. Rise to Power is just a movie that has the name of Carlito. There should be at least a few characters from the original movie, the ending does not make sense in relation to the original. At the end of this movie, he retires with his sweet heart, but how the hell did we get him out of jail in the next movie? And his wife is not even the same woman he speaks as his only love in the original. I would say the film is slightly fun in itself, with a few decent bits, but it's nothing compared to the big brother. Do not stay up at night hoping to see this, watch the original one more time if you really need a hit.
