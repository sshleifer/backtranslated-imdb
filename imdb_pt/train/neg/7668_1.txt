The minute the striker started, I knew we were in trouble! The premise is laughable at best. The plot was even worse, if that is possible. <br /> <br /> The performance was hard and the actors gave a feeling of inexperience. You expect more from the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered as if they were from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid, but she was very unbelievable as an archeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a bad movie to try to stage their returns. <br /> <br /> Continuity was eliminated throughout the film. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. <br /> <br /> In short, I want 90 minutes of my life back. They can keep the money, but give me time! What a waste.
