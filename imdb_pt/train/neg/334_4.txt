Bad movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with lots of bad special effects, a lot of hurried scenes (the one at the airport, for example), and a real dull moment. (Charles Dance) is horrible as the evil guy and he is much better at Last Action Hero. (Eddie Murphy) is making a non-comic joke, and I heard that this sunken already had success, great time success ?? !! I will never understand why or how? In a TV interview I heard (Eddie Murphy himself), when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, he regretted in a comical way !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's the 1980s!). Well, not my friend. It's the cinematic madness that made many RAZZIE movies over the years, whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s! <br /> <br /> There are two reasons that made me write about this movie. The first is that I will never forget Charlotte Lewis's long and fascinating legs, especially when she was in bed before the thugs attacked her house, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY, the camera was talking about her bare legs should be. How strange! How did I watch it in the following movies and she was not that beautiful again? !! Anyway, the second reason is that I've found the title of this movie lately in my list of the 100 worst movies ever! <br /> <br /> The result: Bad movie, Greeeeeat's legs.
