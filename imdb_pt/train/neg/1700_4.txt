In movies, I feel it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on the screen. This little David Lynch tells a story but not much of a story. I felt it was funny but very bizarre to be a comedy. It's good to make movies, but there's nothing more to do. Like I said before, I'm a big fan of David Lynch, but I get frustrated with some of his work because I do not see the need for it. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know he still has a lot of flair and I'm excited to see what he has booked for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check this out, but do not be surprised when you do not like it very much.
