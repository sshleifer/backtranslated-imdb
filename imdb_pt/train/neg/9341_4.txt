This short film by Hal Roach, A Tough Winter, is the ninety-nine in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh talkie. Bascally a black comic bookcase Stepin Fetchit, which gets a special billing here, we see him going to his cabin where the gang walks. Farina retrieves a love letter from the mail to him and is told by Stepin to read it, since he can not read it during the day while he goes to school NIGHT. It turns out it's from his girlfriend in Tennesse, so now Farina has to have her ears full of cotton, since it's too hot for him to hear! In another room, Weezer transmits instructions to Mary Ann to make taffy from the radio, but because he keeps going back and forth to the kitchen, he misses the hint of the lady announcer for rice pudding and Spanish tamale confusing Mary Ann with additions from Tabasco and Lux ! After the mix is ​​completed, Jackie and the rest of the class help themselves with the horrible tasting, but with a very sticky substance, as everyone gets stuck on the walls as a result. While everyone tries to clear the mess, Stepin works in the basement in various tubes and electrical outlets that mix the variable functions of appliances, such as a telephone that sucks, a vacuum cleaner that plays and a refrigerator that plays music! The end. What I have just described foreshadows the winding nature of this short "Our Gang" which served as pilot for a short series of potential films by Stepin Fetchit. It's good that it never happened, since Fetchit's characterization of the lazy Negro was fun only in small doses and would be considered highly offensive today. Many of the scenes I just described are good for a few laughs, although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were simply too positive for me. So in summary, A Tough Winter is a curiosity worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
