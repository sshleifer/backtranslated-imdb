I was taking care of a family of three small children for one night and their mother gave me this to show them they just picked up at Wal-Mart earlier in the week. All three children were physically ill while they watched. I'm sure it was the pizza they ate, or something they all picked up at school, but it really could have been that movie. Absolutely disgusting. How anyone can produce this garbage gauge is beyond me. Fortunately, I hung up the movie when I realized that the kids were not responding and acting strangely. For all parents, I strongly advise you to keep small children from watching this movie.
