The movie is badly cast, except for some old Hollywood family names. Other performances of unknown names (eg Jennifer Gabrielle) are uninspiring. I've seen other films from this director, unfortunately this is one of their worst. Maybe this is a reflection of the script? <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the performance of Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita saved the film from oblivion. I liked Pat more in the Karate Kid, though. There are many good movies to watch and, in summary, this is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
