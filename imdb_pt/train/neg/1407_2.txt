After life is a miracle, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe that these movies were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet is two hours of clowning without history. The wild and rampant mood of the Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. It seems that Kusturica has been progressively lowering since it began to make life affirmation comedies, starting with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think is great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I really enjoyed your first films, which is why it's especially disappointing to see something like that. Let's hope the next one is great.
