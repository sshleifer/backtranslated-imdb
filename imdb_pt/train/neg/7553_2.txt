A phenomenal achievement in horror. In fact, it's hilariously horrible. <br /> <br /> First off ... Nicholas Cage now must have made it to the finals in the Over-Emoting category in his acting class. Wearing new plugs of hair and with a face that has been lifted so many times that his fanged rear ears seem to be struggling to touch his back, he conveys not only a lack of attention, but creates a "hero" character in which you have no interest . <br /> <br /> I do not know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. He makes the females totally devious and evil ... and pays them back for having Cage punching several of them directly into the face and calling them "b **** es" a few times as well. I liked the first LaBute movies and some of his pieces ... but it's a strange fascination he has. <br /> <br /> I would give this film a 2 out of 10 based solely on Ellen Burstyn's performance. The moment she finally makes her appearance (bravely facing her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead), it seems that all hope may be lost. She deserves an Oscar here and now for saying her lines with a serious face and when she appears wearing a white and blue, white and gold mumu painting the face of The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepared her for this role it's very good. <br /> <br /> This movie is so wrong and cuckoo it needs to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Highlights include: Nicholas Cage fleeing a swarm of bees and then falling off a hill. Nicholas Cage stealing a bike and looking like Mrs. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz walking on it. <br /> Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking the doors in search of the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski GETTING from a promising acting career in a "fight" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dancing around A said while mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage shouting "Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned?" without a reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage with a bear costume (I'm not kidding) running through the woods, taking off fantasy (but leaving bear's feet) and then doing some karate moves for some villains. <br /> <br /> And you did not live until you saw the last 15 minutes of the movie and its terrible epilogue that looked like it was filmed yesterday in your cousin's basement. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you can get through this movie without laughing out loud, then you deserve a medal. There was really a point in the movie where I stopped laughing to wonder if maybe this was not an elaborate presentation of "hysteria" movies ... just to be reminded when Cage screamed / shouted / whispered his dialogue that he really was taking very seriously. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is meant to be a cult movie all over again ... just because it's so horrible.
