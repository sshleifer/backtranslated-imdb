There are some Stallone movies that I like, but this movie did not meet my low expectations. I found this movie hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists who fall into the desert are prepared to survive for at least two days. In addition, throughout the wilderness, Stallone and company continue to cross bridges and ladders that provide convenient shortcuts or plotting devices. In addition, the Treasury cops do not seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue personnel. In addition, thugs who could not hit the side of a barn with high-tech automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> I liked John Lithgow's villain initially, but the character is such a complete psychopath that he does not like it. Do not worry about anything about your own thugs, or all of them being killed. Eventually, I could not believe the character anymore. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of a rental, nor is it worth it to set aside time to watch.
