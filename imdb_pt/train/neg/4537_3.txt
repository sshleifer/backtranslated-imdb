I really did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw in a camp, and we did not get excited about it, we laughed at it. Of course, some parts are playing but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole general idea of ​​the movie is terrible (now, I know it was based on a book I did not read but hopefully the book was better that's because, frankly, I thought this movie was really bad and boring). Like I said, I went up there with a group of people from a camp and we were excited to be there, plus I had a caffeinated drink, but even then I struggled to stay awake. The only thing that kept me awake (besides my fear of being embarrassed when I woke up) were the shots, which were also very useless. I really did not like that.
