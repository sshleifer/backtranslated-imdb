I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of sheer boredom and stupidity, I turned the channel on. The original series lasted only 2 years, which can be said about the careers of Adam West and Burt Ward. Put these two "actors" in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad.
