<br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie last night at Cinemax, I was shocked to have been made. Intentions Cruel, in my opinion, was one of the best films aimed at teenagers made in years. This prequel had certain things incongruous with the original. (Sebastian's father married wealthy, so why does he have a rich, long island aunt?) So I discovered today that it was not meant to be a new movie but rather a television series , Manchester Prep. After hearing this, it made sense to me that it was not the same as the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble probably added the ending that this movie had, AFTER the series was not chosen by Fox. It seems like something would happen too fast (Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn) and I I just do not know where they would go in the next episode, since it would not be leading to the 1999 film (which is the youngest). The end is directed to the right.) One thing I did not like was that he suggested that Sebastian and his father had married wealth, which is not typically seen well in this area of ​​New York . and Katharine's mother was just an adult version of her, it did not look like something a woman in her position would do, marry a man who was not her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel this is pretty lame. But I would be interested to see where this happened as a series.
