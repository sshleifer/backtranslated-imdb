A sequel to (actually a remake of) Disney's 1996 live-action 101 Dalmations remake. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being "cured" of her obsession with skin by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But the "cure" is broken when Cruella hears the Big Ben toll, and she once again goes on a mad quest to become the perfect dalmation fur coat. <br /> <br /> This movie is bad so many levels, starting with the fact that it is a "Thanksgiving family schlock" movie designed to suck the last dime available from the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-over-age as Cruella. With everything she had to endure in this movie - the lame screenplay, the endless makeup, being baked in a cake at the end - I hope they have given you an extremely large salary. <br /> <br /> (Speaking of which, where in the world will you find a fur factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelight restaurant, all located within the same building - like you do at the climax of this movie?) Of course the real stars of the movie should be the dogs. They serve as the "Macaulay Culkin" of this movie, pulling all the idiots "Home Alone" on the villains. (Biting them in the crotch, running on their hands with luggage carts, squirting them with ice, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.) I have to admit, dogs were good actors - far better than or humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted on this film as a frightened French furrier. The two human "dog lovers" - rewritten from the previous film, but with different actors - are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, the movie goes back and forth between the two lovers, and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene of "Lady and the Tramp." I thought to myself, "Oh, please do not go there!" I half expected the humans to make a satire on the dinner scene "Lady and the Tramp" - as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - making the "spaghetti kiss", pushing the meatball with her nose and not make me think of the annoying parrot with the voice of Eric Idle. <br /> <br /> The costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes for the movie are good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. The rest is unbearable.
