This is the worst crap I've seen recently. There's nothing good about this movie. The plot is simply stupid, dialogues do not make sense, funny scenes have never heard of the real mood. Actors simply do not play, the worst they do not even try. The script itself is a bit that is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There's only one good thing about this movie, the fights. They are well choreographed as you would expect from the Hong Kong guys, and they are the only reason to watch the Prince of the Sun. Although I believe that the fights should fill the empty space so the writer does not have to worry about thinking about the plot. However, this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it until the end. Avoid unless you're a fan of Dragon Lady Cynthia Rothrock.
