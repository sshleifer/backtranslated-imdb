This movie is horrible. In the end you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can not return. The final "twist" is very artificial. The development of the character leading to this end is not consistent with his final actions in conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation - with the premise that the character Rob Lowe is going to die on Christmas Eve - is explained in literally ninety seconds of "No, we were just fooling you." So the character Rob Lowe is not at all upset about it! "I'll forgive you if you can forgive me," he's as annoyed as he is. If it took anyone weeks to convince me that I was about to die and then say, "No, sorry, I'm just fooling you," I would raise a hell of a lot. I do not feel bad about giving the spoiler because I may be able to save some of you by watching. Please save yourself and do not watch this movie.
