This piece of dirt is practically impossible to follow. The sound sucks the image quality goes from bad to worse from good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason, the characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during his production? <br /> <br /> Poor film making aside, the story is vile just sick ill sh * t If you like rape, murder and self-harm this is right up your alley. And if simulated murder scenes are not enough, you'll be able to enjoy clips of real people being executed. I watched almost all of this, but had to hang up after I saw some brains exploding. Never before have I seen a movie that made me so embarrassed and dirty.
