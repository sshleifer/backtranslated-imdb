"Unreal" movie, where were these people? A mix of French Upstairs Downstairs, mating horses, porn (not suggested, it's pretty full for a movie) & bestiality with a bit of Benny Hill music & chase played scenes, sounds crazy and it's even more to watch. ** Looter ** He crawls in a tedious fashion for a long time, .... then a lamb makes a runner, leading the woman in a period dress to run after him, she goes to the forest where she is attacked by an erect "penis" attached to a man in a bear / mouse mannequin suit, I put it so it's obvious that the "penis" is in command and stays a long screen time, ejaculating for most of it anyway In summary, it turns out she liked a bit of bear / rat tadger and it's about that, the rest is just padding. ** spoiler end ** A movie made to shock and offend, so being talked about, any advertising is good publicity, I suppose, a waste of time really, but the "main event" has to be seen to be believed, it is difficult to imagine that Someone thought it was a good idea while filming it.
