I will not describe the story, as it was done elsewhere. We're great fans of Clive Owen, and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> No wonder we had never heard of this "movie," because it was a BBC Television movie in 1992. Therefore, poor production figures, grainy image, spasmodic camera work and the weak sound. <br /> <br /> But, you do not care about mechanics, because the story itself will put you to sleep. It's an interesting human story, but nothing compelling, and there's almost no end. You really do not care about the characters because your lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie. Save the two hours and do something worthwhile.
