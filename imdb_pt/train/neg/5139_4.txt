Many horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I will not be too popular to say I found it boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag on so much. I think the main problem is that everything is in the dark. Sometimes horror movies set in the dark can work (like Humongous), but Scarecrows are dark throughout the movie. Most of the time, it's hard to figure out what's really going on, and although some scarecrow pictures were scary, most were hard to see. If a little more light had been used, maybe it could have been better. <br /> <br /> There are not many movies involving murderous scarecrows that I know of, besides Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is so much better. I would recommend this about the Scarecrows any day.
