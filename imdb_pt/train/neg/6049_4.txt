Firstly, anyone who thinks that this sequel to "The French Connection" by William Friedkin is superior is definitely completely insane or imbecile or both. The problem with reviewing this movie is that, a.) It's a sequel to a brilliant movie, which always makes objectively difficult watching, and b.) It is directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors of all time, so I I wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a drug-trafficking film in decadent New York City because of his documentary approach to action and history. Frankenhimer, on the other hand, is one of the most stylish directors in history, "The Manchurian." Candidate "and" Seconds, "and with his" French Connection 2 "it seems that someone is trying to be tough and not have the true understanding to get it." Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequence by Gene Hackman himself Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed never to work with him again, it is also known that he imagined that the character was more one-dimensional, losing weight and trying to interpret him as a character hetero.This shows that Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who would make the film and the story as good as it would be.The point of Doyle's plot to become an addict is interesting but does not guarantee the rest of the film An unfortunate low in Frankenhimer filmography.
