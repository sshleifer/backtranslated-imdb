When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a good sasquatch movie. Usually, when you have these types of movies, there is usually a sasquatch, but in this there is like what? 7 or 10 of them? Acting was good, plot was OK, I liked the scenes in which the sasquatch is killing the first victims, very good camera work. I was hoping it was a bloody movie, but it was too little. This movie was a lot better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to do more sasquatch movies, I mean I really enjoyed Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, what I'm reviewing is OK, but the Sasquatch movie was not, but I'm not reviewing it let "I'm back on track. This movie is good for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but for any other occasion, it's not.
