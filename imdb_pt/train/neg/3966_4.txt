Granted, I'm not the connoisseur d'horror my partner is, but a good together, clever film is worth the time. My frustrations, in summary: <br /> <br /> - Dialogue often weak and sometimes unbelievable coming from the given character. <br /> <br /> - Unconvincing performance. <br /> <br /> - Plot never really caught fire. <br /> <br /> The screenwriters ripped off chosen pieces of half a dozen conventional films, tossed in a kettle, boiled hard enough, and tried to feed us from poor juices the resulting mess, aldente. <br /> <br /> Long and short, though not absolutely terrible, was definitely not worth absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals.
