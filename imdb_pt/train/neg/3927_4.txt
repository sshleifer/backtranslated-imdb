A story of terror so common about a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates of hell. It is reminiscent of Polanski's "The Tenant" (released a year before "The Sentinel"), but is far from the Polish filmmaker's film in any way possible. "The tenant" was so disturbing, while "The Sentinel" is nothing. <br /> <br /> What is most surprising about this film is the cast: it is full of big names from American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actors acting for food (I think). <br /> <br /> Verdict: Bad fun. My rate: 4/10
