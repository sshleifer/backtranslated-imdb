Wow ... what can I say ... The first IMDb movie says it's in the late 60's ... which means Carlito would be very close to going to jail. He left at 75 and said he was inside for 5 years. They used a lot of actors from no one and a story that did not make sense. They bring back only one actor, Guzman, and he's playing a totally different guy. Why did it end with him and this Puerto Rican girl? Wheres Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Where's Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You'd think he'd be in it. And if that makes sense, where are Rocco and the black guy at first? It was all very stupid ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first film.
