Good evening, Mr. Tom starts off in an incredibly refined village in South England, where the sun always seems to shine. Before we had much idea of ​​the period, we heard a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when the small, timid William is lodged with reluctant and rude Tom (who you know will eventually have a golden heart) our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a load of sentimental claptrap is. In fact, it's just the old formula of odd comrades. Are not the new stories being written? As I have suggested, there is hardly a period in the village, and there is not much else in London besides the strange old ambulance. And certainly no hint of Blitz's horror, while the citizens of London politely enter anti-aircraft coats. Even when the local school teacher's husband is declared missing, it is presumed that he was killed, he is later restored. I found the phrase "Good evening, Mr. Tom" cliché and obvious, and John Thaw's accent evoked a picture of Ronnie Barker. The two Ronnies with a straw in their mouth making their country 'bumpkin' accent. <br /> <br /> By the way, my wife liked this movie for all the reasons I did not like it and looking at fellow-imdb ​​commentators I seem to be in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
