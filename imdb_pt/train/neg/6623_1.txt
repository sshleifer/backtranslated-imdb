Firstly, sorry for giving up a rating of 1 for this movie (nothing less than that available). The film fails in all departments, whether in the script, direction, characterization or acting. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin with, the name of the movie is really Class C (although the movie itself matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live up to the character, but the weak script, along with the pathetic direction, ends up making him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has a reward of 50,000 in him (which was convincing). Here in Aag, the figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called heroes and had only a few men to get around (with all automatic weapons) making a Sholay type movie in Mumbai. seems convincing 4) As for Nisha Kothari, someone needs to tell her that she does not know how to act. Why is Ram Gopal Verma playing her again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good but there is almost nothing for him to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, are wasted in the film. 7) The legendary role played by Lila Misra (Mausi de Basanti) in Sholay is replaced at low cost in this film by some Gang Mummy. Ramu, please grow up and understand that there must be some intellect in your movie. Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent. <br /> <br /> To summarize, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of the original classic. Please do not waste time and money on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I think was the worst possible movie) would be a better idea than seeing this horrible pack of stupid characters, bad songs and unhappy direction. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Saurabh
