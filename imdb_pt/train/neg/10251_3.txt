Lots of running around. An ill-conceived opponent with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communications sending signals to space and receiving them is picked up by aliens. Along with his beautiful wife, he invades their territory and receives secrets about them. He becomes quite treacherous in the process. Granted, it is given little choice anyway. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a boring movie with many long stretches where little happens. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we're usually following a car, a trip through a forest, investigating a building. This is what editing is all about. I suppose the story would not technically support much more. Not much here.
