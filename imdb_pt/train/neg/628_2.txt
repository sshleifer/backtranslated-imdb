This movie had the potential to be a decent horror film. The main character was decently done and I felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of background story. However, everything else sucks. The director, Emmanuel, is quite incompetent in the movies. He uses some of the dumbest shots of all time. <br /> <br /> - some random sequences of random images have spread throughout the film. I do not know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic, but he was not. It was stupid. Random photos of the trailer in which the main character lived, random buildings, random photos of buildings, random cats moving away. WTF And clouds. Many dark and dark clouds. <br /> <br /> He really liked this technique of having a cut scene in different scenes, instead of just being a continuous shot. EX: Guy is trying to light his grass and the camera circles around him. Instead of just one shot, it puts you in 10 different pictures, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and intelligent! Stupid. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, but it's what makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast because he turns and turns and turns all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main bully to have a long, well-built death, but no. A single ear of corn in the ear. Love interest was hot. Voluptuous. That 's why this movie gets a 2.
