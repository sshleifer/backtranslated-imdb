Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 is the pinnacle. It has been said before, this is what happens when half the crew falls asleep at work, unfortunately half the game did. Do not get me wrong, this is fun, but you get tired of pushing buttons. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot. Hit that guy in the end and win! Hey, who plays this for himself, anyway?
