Intentions Cruel 2 is horrible, I mean uber-bad. Words can not explain how bad it is, but I'll try anyway. <br /> <br /> The plot of Cruel Intentions 2 is very much like the first movie. Sebastian (Robin Dunne), is expelled from a private school and is forced to move to New York. There he decides to make a fresh start and just a normal living life and settle down. Unfortunately he has to deal with his half sister Kathryn (Amy Adams) wants to drag him down. Sebastain begins to fall in love with Danielle (Sarah Thompson), the innocent daughter of the school principal. Kathryn wants Sebastain to just sleep with the entire school that has been described as a "whore house." Kathryn also wants revenge with Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who humiliated her during the school assembly. Kathryn wanted to turn the first student into the school's biggest slut, a sub-plot similar to the first film. <br /> <br /> Cruel Intentions 2 is basically a canceled TV show that has been turned into a prequel. There are so many problems with the movie. It is poorly written, bland and poorly represented. Luckily for Amy Adams the show never took off because now she's a great actress. While Cruel Intentions had a sense of realism and can be seen in the real world, Cruel Intentions 2 is set on sitcoms and as described in amazon.co.uk 'A Rude Version of Saved by the Bell'. There were some dark themes involving sex and drug use in the first film, but in Cruel Intentions 2 they tried to make it funny and some of the movie's ideas should not be like Kathryn having an affair with a teacher. Other ideas also do not work, such as the secret society where all the children gather to discuss the fall of other students. The film also had a major sexualization problem of 15/16 years. I know that teenagers have sex, sometimes a lot, but when done in the movies or on television, it is treated very seriously. A famous sentiment was when Daneille encourages Cherie (who is around 14/15 in the film) to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has an orgasm. The idea of ​​turning a girl around 14/15 into a prostitute is very wrong with me, and should not be turned into a comedy affair. The jokes in the film are insane, be it a verbal joke like "she gets all wet when she sees it", a visual gag in which Sebastian pushes Kathryn face-first into the mud. <br /> <br /> There is a lot wrong with this movie, which I do not have time to get into, but I say it should be avoided. Just watch Cruel Intentions, although it's not a classic, it's still a decent movie and it treats the subject well. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a wet pervert dream, having school kids having too much sex with each other. .
