Wow!! Only such a ridiculously horrible movie could inspire similar "Showgirls." I mean where do you start? Does the music indescribably horrible? The non-expressions of Pia Zadora throughout the film? The fact that, despite being in Los Angeles, also known as "land of the casting sofa," EACH single man (and woman!) Is cajoling to sleep with Pia Zadora by some artificial means necessary? And what about the fact that all the people in the movie are totally unfriendly because they are stupidly boring (Pia) or despicable and despicable (all others)? And since this movie was written by "writers", it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the film industry (who would Hell admire and kiss a screenwriter?) <br /> <br /> But it's (unintentionally) hell. The scene of "collapse" will only make you laugh, and after seeing the climatic scene "I'm not the only one who had to make way to the top" in the "Awards" (all made at the usual level of bargaining action which we expect from quality actors like Pia), I sincerely hope our dear Pia actually reused this speech when she "won" her Golden Globe. Make my day. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you are a fan of a bad and tashy camp, try the movie.
