Will they never make movies without nudity and sex? This came at 3:00 pm on Sunday and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God my son was on the outside or I would have been scared if he had seen mild / average porn! Do not movie makers care who they offend or corrupt? The kids could have been watching after the church and that's what they show ??? !!! The acting was good and I liked the suspense, but GEE! There was violence and thugs, but this is to be expected in a Western movie. Randy Travis was very good in his role. If the writers, directors and producers simply gave up putting so many unnecessary sex scenes. What has to happen so they stop going in that direction? Where can I complain?
