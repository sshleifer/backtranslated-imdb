It's a shame when a potentially captivating and discreetly discreet story manages to lure your interest in the beginning and then gradually lets you down more and more until you get scratching your confused head the moment it reaches its exaggerated conclusion. Unfortunately, this is what happened to me at the end of WHITE NOISE. <br /> <br /> It was not Michael Keaton's fault; it was a pleasure to see him come back as the star of a new film, perhaps a little wrinkled, but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance. As a man whose wife has recently died, he becomes obsessed with his wandering spirit in the afterlife (not a new idea), apparently being contacted by her through the electric fuzz business you see on the television screen when there is nothing being transmitted. The idea of ​​spirits communicating through radio waves is called EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) and there are many people who actually believe it, so I will not make any comments about what I think in it or in them. Let me just say that I am in favor of suspending disbelief when it comes to buying fantastic movies like this, but what I can not tolerate is not understanding what the hell should be going on, which is where I was left stranded when the credits finally began to roll. Very static indeed. Occasionally, there are movies like this that make me completely baffled, but if a movie does not become clear to me, I consider it to be the filmmaker's fault, not mine (unless I watched while I was too tired to concentrate or something). Well, to the WHITE NOISE I was wide awake, with bright eyes and stocky tail - so guess who's to blame?
