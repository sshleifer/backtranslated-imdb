The Fluffer may have strong elements of the truth of the porn industry - but that does not make up for the fact that he is very misguided and acted - and with a very mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Grade B from the beginning to the end too long. <br /> <br /> It would be embarrassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state-of-the-art film production. <br /> <br /> I hope you have a limited life on the gay film festival circuit and are allowed to die of natural death on video. <br /> <br /> This movie will open the Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10, 2002. I think their success will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the previous cocktail party - they will need it.
