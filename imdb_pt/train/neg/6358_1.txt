And how many actors can he play for his own neurotic, compulsive, and New York personality? In this film, Woody is played by Will Ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct imitation than what Kenneth Branagh did in "Celebrity." It's an annoyingly repetitive story now: a nebulous, nebulous man with a wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with a shiksa queen on whom he projects every kind of perfection. Everyone lives in giant apartments perfect in Manhattan's great neighborhoods, they all constantly patronize expensive and exclusive restaurants during which all characters relate fascinating stories and discuss arcana philosophy, there is always a trip to the Hamptons during which the main character nebulosity talks about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to disease, and then, of course, the main character feels guilty for his lust for the Shiksa queen, but pursues her anyway, sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is a tired formula and proof that Allen is not really a great movie performer. He just looks like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20-year-old girl who intends to tell the same boring old stories over and over again.
