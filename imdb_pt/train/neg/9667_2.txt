This film is justly famous as one of the most horrific examples of propaganda ever produced. The insistent equation of the Jews with the disease is simply pathological, and worse, it almost becomes believable for a few seconds, through its repetition. The fact that some of this oil works, even briefly, is an objective lesson in itself. You have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through it, and I would not recommend trying unless you have a good reason.
