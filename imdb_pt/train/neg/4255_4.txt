the film opens with a beautiful lady in a ragged white dress passing through a stereotypical eastern European town. we know she's being followed by something because she keeps looking back. and soon we see that she is being pursued by a mysterious man in a black coat. then we realize that the man is really the vampire hunter and he's after her. but look is that the reflection of it in the store window ??? it's not just your identical twin vampire! but unfortunately both understand. <br /> <br /> After this brilliant and incredibly fun setback for the old hammer movies of the 60s and 70s (in the credits the twins are listed as the evil twins, of course The plot practically dies. > <br /> The little plot that exists involves Dracula (who conveniently changes his appearance every time he is reborn, so the producer does not do that.) I do not have to rehire the same dracula) arriving at a morgue, medical students noticing that he's dead and thinking ... wow what an opportunity, maybe I just disregard all those movies that say that drinking vampire blood transforms you into a vampire and uses vampire blood to find a cure for our idiot friend's disease. Obviously, this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but it went terribly wrong. The film continues to create wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, medical students try to bring drac back to life by putting it in a tub filled with blood in an isolated country. mansion. The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the movie, but are we there? No, because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned pool. Sigh. This movie has a real problem with "honors" as I mentioned before the opening scene is straight from the hammer, and this scene from the house would have been perfect for a hammer film, but the film quickly changes gears and changes to a medical horror The other problem is that they introduce so many characters that it is almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them. There are medical students and their wheelchair teacher "friends" that medical students are all: arrogant, boring, money hungry, and stupid. how they managed to get to medical school impresses me unless medical school has to meet their stallion / big breast quota. and then there's the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the movie. Hey, I can respect that, but it would be nice if they did not figure out how the movie would be about it. then you have random priests, cops, and types of science. many people are presented and quickly forgotten until they need to save the day or jump to a cheap scare that becomes quickly tedious. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a lazy movie. There are no real scares, just a few predictable jumps. The setup for these is so elaborate that it's hilarious. for example, the tub full of blood. It is so obvious that the drac will come out of the dark blood. and we still have to wait a long time to get to the inevitable fright. after that, he kills one of the largest and most numerous medical students. We all know she's going to become one of the undead. but what do others do? bury her in a shallow grave near the house. sigh, then you know who will jump at you when the cops show up at the house .......... Oh well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will stick with the insinuation that it is impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go to the atmosphere, and then we will end up with a whole movie that is as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
