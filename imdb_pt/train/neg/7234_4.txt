In one word: excruciating. I was advised to read a few articles on the philosophical meanings of the film later, but after having passed through the endless 115 minutes of the film and being slowly crushed by its swollen symbolism and fluid oppression, it seemed better to relate my reactions to the film. After all, who's going to see a movie with a resume in hand? And this movie was bleak. The lead actor, Claude Laydu, from the opening to the end of the film, wears the same annoying and wearisome mask of agony that is virtually indistinguishable from the film's eternal and sad voice. Filming one over the other may have worked better than subjecting an audience to both, since they basically say the same thing: Ambricourt's priest is a miserable human being. The story, about a persecuted priest who tries to help a rich and troubled family, does nothing to make his characters remotely interesting or friendly, since the family is a bunch of nasty weirdos, and the priest himself appears as a meddling plague. . The last 30 minutes suggest some breathtaking message about the grace and suffering of a man equal to others, but due to all the indulgent close-ups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtext in Robert Bresson's script, all that I felt it was over, let's have an ice cream. Interesting for fans of Bresson's fanatic Paul Schrader, just to see how many character elements and scenery Schrader has uploaded to his own scripts and films, especially "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
