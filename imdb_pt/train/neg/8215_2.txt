I really felt bad about the actors in this thing. No doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at least a job. The actors must have thought that this would be their big chance to work on a movie, certainly it was not. Besides the terrible acting, the stories were boring and, for the most part, predictable. The one on the remote control made no sense at all. For evil because it had the best premise of the group. <br /> <br /> I am all for supporting low budget films and giving the new filmmakers a fair chance but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I just watched because of some good reviews posted here. They must have been planted by people attached to the film. You can trick people into observing this, but you can not fool them into liking what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave 2 instead of 1 because at least the story of the boxer tried to be cheery. Of course he failed miserably, but he tried. I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble. I want to have.
