Serge Farnel made a very accurate review of this film in "The Rwandese Night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net). A critique that shows how France was behind the whole situation suffered by the United Nations in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation, while French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the forces of genocide. <br /> <br /> The day before, ten UN soldiers had been killed by the police. Forces of genocide. <br /> <br /> That's why UN soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the French trucks. <br /> <br /> In doing so, they gave up the Tutsis, which is unforgivable. Clear. <br /> <br /> But we must keep in mind that the French soldiers organized this situation.
