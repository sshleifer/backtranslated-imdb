Overall, this movie is terrible and should never have been done. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example if it is about to be attacked, you want to feel, "Oh my God, no!", But you do not In this case, you does not care because there is no link that has been made to know the character. In the trailer, it looked like the movie would be great, but there is still no suspense. There may have been some mystery, but it does not exist. "All she has is a toolbox." was said on the back of the DVD, you would think it was carefully planned this movie, and cleverly done, but it is not, The end, was simply horrible, very direct, and senseless too. The performance is average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion, it was a waste of an hour of my life. The "special effects" and sets were average too, nothing special that so ever. There is not much blood or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This movie was advertised to make it look amazing but actually not worth looking for, I would not recommend this to anyone unless they are easily satisfied by some fights and a boring story.
