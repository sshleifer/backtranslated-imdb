As a child, the first part ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was filled with great characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week or so I watched this movie for the first time. I believe this movie was like most of the sequences and did not surpass the original. I think I feel that way, possibly because I had high expectations and I grew up. However, it is not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgan (sister of Eurselas), so they build a large wall around their house, which is in the sea. As Melody grows, she begins to wonder outside the walls where she is forbidden to go. The trouble stirs as Morgan tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give away any movie, so you have to see it to find out. I liked that the voices are the same and again singing beautifully. I think this is a good family movie, overall!
