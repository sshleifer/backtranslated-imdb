When I saw that IMDb users ranked this movie as the 250 most recent movies, I thought it was very hard, but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Wayans brothers. . I loved his scary movie 2 and even liked White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were obsolete. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays an adult dwarf who has recently been released from prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond intended for a gangster. Things go wrong and the dwarf has to put the diamond together with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the dwarf pretends to be an abandoned baby left at the door of the unsuspecting couple. Of course, he is taken and the drama begins in search of the diamond. <br /> <br /> The film has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as In Living Color. All these talents, however, can not help the poor script and the jokes that just were not funny. <br /> <br /> The special effects to make Marlon Wayans look like a dwarf, alright. I mean, it was not 100% believable, but it was OK ... nothing great. I just wanted the Wayans brothers to have worked harder to develop a script with good jokes than to try to fix their poor script with appearances from their famous comedy actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> Wait for it on cable or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.
