This movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think they understood. Anyone who tries to make any sense of it is a MORON! My advice would be to take TWO not one, but TWO very strong acid strokes and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it !! Although in the end you can kill yourself by wasting your acid !!!! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those who will try to defend the film. Unintelligible Garbage. Schitzoid. Waste of talent. The movie is ice, with paper in the destination with clouds, on a sunny dip in the pudding .... Sounds like a lion in a red light with seeing hair. Now explain this to me !!!!
