Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question, "What is the worst movie ever made ... ever?" It's Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Of course there are many famous movies, but this one takes the cake that takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a Romanian movie that talks about how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood. He also talks about how completely devoid of intelligence and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> It was only released on video (I can not imagine why) and I suspect that the workers who had to make the DVD had to wear protective gear and receive regular advice.
