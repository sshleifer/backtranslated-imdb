I read the book by James Hawes. It was very good, not great, but fun enough. Without having read the book, I would have no idea what was going on, and it was still a step with that knowledge. <br /> <br /> Literally, every element of this movie is abysmal in ways I do not. has the ability to describe. Half-digested fish could have made a better film with phosphorus sticks and dayglo lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or since, like a movie, did I feel so angry. The aftermath of the mattress was the closest, but even they never reached such sickly putrid depths as this basement did. <br /> <br /> Since we've spent 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on mankind, I can not now see any book by James Hawes without feeling angry. That's the depth of the hatred I have for this piece of shit. No, this is unfair. Let me apologize to all the fecal matter for comparing it to the evil of the other world that is Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Simply and simply a cancer in the world of cinema.
