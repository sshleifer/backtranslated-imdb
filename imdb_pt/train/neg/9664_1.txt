This book-based movie is really awful and a big disappointment. We have been waiting for this move for over a month. Many film critics expected this. Also in the newspapers and on TV, it made a lot of sense. When April 29 arrives, many people have noted with regret that the film is really awful. Because? First of all, the story was so monotonous. It's been a lot of undefined scenes, sometimes it's hard to figure out what's going on. The actresses, out of Hulya Avsar, were not in harmony with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She acts best in comedy movies, in this film, a kind of drama, she could not get rid of her previous role. And finally the film is very short, only 66 minutes.
