In this movie, old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. He knows her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Taboo, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her to leave. His reaction to his invitation is quite strange. It was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> And it bothers me about this whole movie. It was not so funny. The jokes and script were terrible! The only jokes I liked were about a waiter's teeth, but after several times, even this started to get bored. <br /> Amitabh has a sexy girlfriend named. This was a weird relationship! A girl with the mind of an old woman! It was scary! I know someone can be connected to a child, but this man has adult conversations with that child. It did not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can not do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit around the table, even this should be funny. <br /> <br /> I just like movies that are really funny. I guess I'll never watch this movie again.
