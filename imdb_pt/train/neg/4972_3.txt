It's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: bad performance, bad acoustics from different parts, bad CGI, improper sets for the period, poor script. It would have been nice if the script followed the original story a little closer - there is enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a good amount of good material and a better story than the writers could propose. /> <br /> And why introduce a strange new weapon like a beast that shoots an explosive ray? <br /> <br /> I see that this movie was made in "only" 21 days. This shows the lack of quality. I'm beginning to think that this is a general (bad) attitude taken by the science fiction channel (and others) when it comes to making movies from classic tales in recent years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
