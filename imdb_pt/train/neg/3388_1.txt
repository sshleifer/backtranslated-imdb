I admit I was a fan of the original stage production. I've never seen the movie version until very recently on the cable, and watched it in advance, to see my memories brought to life again, because I loved the original show. Imagine my discouragement. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst translation of a Broadway show for a movie of all time. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost their soul. I was waiting for a trip down memory lane, singing for the extraordinarily touching Music and the Mirror in the Ballet, and Hello Twelve, Hello Treze. Not! Not only did they tamper with the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they also messed up the plot, adding songs and external plots (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) not present in the original and injecting "drama" where it was not needed. The original had enough pathos on its own. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, do not bother. I'm sorry, I wasted my time and diluted my memories by watching this gut.
