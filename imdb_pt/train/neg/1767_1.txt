Can anyone ask why? the characters growl, scream and chew the scene for no discernible reason, unless someone wants to make a movie in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, is that the right person? It is forgettable in the role of cop / distant husband / amorous father of cute-blond-girl. the story seems to have been clipped and glued to the scenes played out of adventure movies in the last three years. The lack of ellen pompeo's charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy of every scene she's in. her true range of performance is displayed when she takes off her blouse as the films move from one chase scene to another. unfortunately, the direction is rarely bad enough to be a camp or a parody. It's all just cliche, familiar in every way. The director considered his own daughter as the precocious brat, probably because no respectable agent would have allowed a client to ruin his career by being in such a lame, artificial and uninteresting movie. the only assault here is stealing the investor's money and the viewer's time.
