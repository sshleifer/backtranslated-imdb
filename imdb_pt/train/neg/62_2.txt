SWING! is an important film because it is one of the remaining production and acting films of the 1930s. Many of these films simply deteriorated so much that they are unattainable, but this is in good shape. It's also a good opportunity to see many of the talented black artists of the period right after the heyday of the old Cotton Club - a time almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to Hollywood musicals of the era - including a prima donna that will ruin the show and the unknown surprise that appears nowhere to save the day. However, the writing is simply awful and a bit pointless at times - and projects images of Black America that some may find a bit humiliating. This is because, before the story really begins, you are treated by a bum again that lives of his working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a whore (which, by the way, totally exaggerates this paper) , they have a fight that looks like a WWE Smackdown scene! And, the only lady wants to cut the other lady with a razor - a useless scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband mug on the face and all the cheer! It seems that the movie sometimes wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the public, moreover, they can not even do it well - with some of the worst acts I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Still, if you get through a bad production in almost all aspects (with useless characters, bad acting and directing and writing bad), you may want to take a look to see great music and tap dance. - As well as glimpsing forgotten black culture. Just do not say I did not warn you about acting - it's really, really bad!
