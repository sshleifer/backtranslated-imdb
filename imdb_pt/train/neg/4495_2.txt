Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow. <br /> <br /> I really liked the original Matrix. It was not a deep movie, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was reasonably well paced, entertaining, and I have a weakness for the Hong Kong fights. <br /> <br /> In the original, Neo was the secret life. quite unhappy cube worker Anderson. By day, corporate drone, and at night, brave hacker. Eventually he is eventually forced to choose between these lives by his actions - he becomes an outlaw fighting the machine, or he returns to the safe and forgettable world in which he began. Curiously, he discovers that once is devoid of illusions life is a drug. He has his girlfriend by his side and his companions, but he does a processed wash, puts on sweats and lives on a really dirty machinery. Yet the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of this first movie is in the "if it were" issues raised in the viewer's mind. What if I was capable of the impossible? And if I were "The One". It does not even matter much what you are. An example of this, with a legal title like this. <br /> <br /> In addition, Agent Smith made a wonderful villain by embracing all the fear of authority we carry with us. He was as unstoppable as an exterminator, and ruthless. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> The film completely fails to realize the ideas of the original movie, and does so with such a lack of taste, such poor script and editing so poor that I can not believe they had planned these changes. When the dialogue is in the fifth year, with several long words randomly discarded, I find it hard to believe they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My little list of characterization flaws: <br/> The Oracle goes a little useful, if it is misleading to totally obstructionist, for no real reason. <br /> <br /> Major "personalities" of the matrix are introduced without necessity - the key master, for example, was a cute idea, but not such an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses his role of "counselor" and can not replace him. <br /> <br /> The people of Zion are not particularly I would not want them to run the world. <br /> <br /> The special effects problems: <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are useless and intermittent. In The Matrix, you felt that Neo could lose, and that he had to become something bigger to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, he is merely the point-of-view character of a particularly badly planned video game. <br /> <br /> The fight on the freeway looked pretty fake, and not so interesting. <br /> <br /> Problems. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the fighting scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> The rave continued for a long time - everyone in my line in the theater was looking at their watch. Not because we care about good dancing and good orgies, but because we did not know about the people portrayed, nor did we care. Whatever trick you wrote, the creator's soliloquy should be blacklisted. He snaked, used words that the writer clearly did not understand and was a waste of time and a killer of rhythm. The discourse of the creator could have been done in a tenth of a time, and with more danger as "Zion exists to give the rebels a place to go, lest they destroy the Matrix." There are now many people who do not believe; in danger of colliding and killing all the people attached to it. Moreover, the earth can not bear even the people in Zion, much less these others. You can choose a person from Zion to form the new Zion while I clean the memories of Zion. people currently in the Matrix. "Instead, we had a long bunch of nonsense. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcript and try to break the sentences. Each is very long by several clauses, and uses words with clearer and shorter synonyms. <br /> <br /> So, in summary, it's not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I saw the third, and despite what several analysts said, skip it. He does not save this turkey. <br /> <br /> Critics who think the second and third movies were "deep" should go see some really deep movies. Maybe I read a book or two about rhetoric and debate, and maybe a little philosophy. This film is not difficult to understand, but it is difficult to tolerate. <br /> Scott
