This is the kind of movie that shows the scarcity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers. The director's desire for "American sound" is so glaring that you will not fool yourself a minute unless you have not seen a movie serial killer from "Peeping Tom". <br /> <br /> Two male cops (or a year and a half, more like you'll see), horrible murders, a plot more complicated than complex. Charles Berling has no luck with the genre (see the incredibly stupid "l'inconnu de Strasbourg" a few years ago). The scenes with his pregnant wife - which should be a counterpart to the noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot - are among the worst that ever existed. filmed.Add a steamy love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge teenage audience.A violent and absurd conclusion followed by a silent epilogue that could make a good commercial for the CÃ´te d'Azur is really the silence of the lame.
