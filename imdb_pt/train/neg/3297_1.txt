Why make a show that millions of us watch and love as children and make a joke full of it? They ask why Hollywood is not making the money they used to make. Because they put trash and they pay the actors huge amounts of money to be garbage collectors and they ask us to pay $ 10 to see their trash. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations, where the good guys from IL came out on top. It was not Gone with the Wind, but it was fun. This movie sucks! Hollywood can not invent anything original, so they take something that is good and spoil everything for a price. I just hope this movie makes 10x smaller than it would cost. The only ones who amuse themselves with this crap are the guys who run General Lee. The public is the victim. <br /> <br /> Do not watch, watch the reruns of the TV show. They still resist 20 years later.
