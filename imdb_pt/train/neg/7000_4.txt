Hollywood, the home of hype, glamor, and profit-seeking, is little governed by spiritual values, so it is not surprising that her attempts to investigate the spiritual life are thin and often silly (better to go further). to the films of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, to probe representations of spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This strange hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it attempts to communicate. That a figure of providence and salvation would work to match Verne (Clark Gable in her most arrogant and selfish form) and Julie (Joan Crawford, snarling and spitting all the other words in an attempt to be the Queen of the Difficult Checkers) seems ridiculous in best of all. Is this the patron saint of the star system in action, combining warrior egos before sending them to greater penal servitude on the M-G-M lot? BUT. . there are good supporting performances here and visually interesting moments: the dark prison quarters; the boat that escaped in the moonlight, or against a pictorial cloudscape; Julie walking along the seafront as the wind blows; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiating Verne's freedom as the storm builds; an unusually ennerving gay prison romance between two convicts. . Above all, there is Paul Lukas' worthy and outstanding performance as Hessler, a killer who can appreciate the virtues of Cambreau but still turns his back on him. At the most impressive moment of the film, Hessler, leaving Cambreau, is outside the hut. We hear the wind through the jungle, we see the shadows on his face, which conveys a moment of fear and insecurity. Then he leaves for the night. At this moment, Hessler reaches an ambiguity, depth and existential force that none of the other personages manages to reach. Is it the secret of the film that your deepest sympathies are allied to Hessler?
