While some performances were good - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and the two Italian girlfriends come to mind - the story was lame and derivative, the emphasis on the girlfriend's racial past was best treated, and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes. not as real people. I found myself shivering uncomfortably in many moments that should be funny. I can hardly understand why the local newspaper here in SF said that this was a good movie, and one wonders who posted the brilliant review here on IMDb. Very disappointed with this movie, and crazy I actually went to a theater to see it, based on the defective connection to Garden State, which is a much funnier, more inventive and moving film than this one. I must especially mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and by numbers that I almost quit, and some in the audience actually did. That was followed by a silly climax in the graveyard, which I saw coming 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like being fooled into spending my money so unnecessarily.
