Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, boring and emotionless thriller directed by the usual collaborator of Amenabar, Mateo Gil. The film, which somehow deals with the effect of boredom and the search for emotions, actually does not deliver any, and it seems like an exercise in boredom. The only slightly suspenseful moment is the film's climax, which takes about 30 seconds of all agony for over 100 minutes, and is solved in too simple a way. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, and although the idea is original, the way the story unfolds is arbitrary and any artifice or plot twist is the result of external interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. If you are a fan of the genre, watch "Thesis" instead.
