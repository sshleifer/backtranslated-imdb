A good movie, with an excellent main lady, but a terrible leader man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the saving grace of the film. She is the best actress in the group. The first comment, from the colleague who praised the film (and, according to his account at IMDB.com, wrote only one review - and guess what movie?) is obviously a plant. While the film is well filmed, it is by no means subtle or grand or any other hypobolic descriptions that the reviewer used. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is a fair film, but it is a big provocation. It offers all kinds of sexual situations, but it never goes through that. How to watch a Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with all the "flaky parts" edited. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole is a little out of focus and the end, and much of the third act, is really a big mess. There is a twist that ends, of course, since all the movies nowadays need to have a different ending. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
