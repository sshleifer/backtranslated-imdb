The comparison may be unfair but inevitable. Those attracted by the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be slightly appalled to discover a musical cut out in the American style - clumsy dialogue and brimming with unexplained numbers of music and dance. Gene Kelly's French accent was apparently so bad, that a horrible dubbing job was replaced (as you may remember, dubbing was almost perfect in Umbrellas). The translation of French (for subtitled versions), too, leaves out to be desired, although this can not be attributed to Demy. The film also has several self-conscious moments that come out a bit disconcerting, as references in music to LeGrand himself. And the clothes - well, the combination of tight pants / white boots and the strangely unnatural colors resemble an Austin Powers movie. . But Demy rewards the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas; look, for example, at the suitcase taken by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase Guy had taken in his departure from Cherbourg. Also note the "Morena Convenient to Resolution" - Madeleine in Umbrellas, and Josette in Young Girls. Generally speaking, those who expect the natural feel of Umbrellas (save the scene of the floating bicycle), or looking for similar ambiguous and deeper questions, as in the Umbrella script, should probably come here. Those looking for a French version of a fine American musical from the 60's will be quite happy.
