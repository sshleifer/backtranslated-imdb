Unfortunately, poor Hamlet. I knew you, dear reader, and let me tell you, THIS VERSION SUCKS! I do not know who of all the people put the money into this flotsam, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic piece and turned it into the most annoying melodrama imaginable. This version is literally so bad, that even the presence of a great actor like Maximilian Schell in the title role can save him. The only redeeming quality of this film is that it is a great food for the "MST3K"; Mike, Servo, and Crow had a great time with this one. <br /> <br /> But anyway, I'm sure Shakespeare, if he were alive when they did this, did not want his name to be associated with it. This "Hamlet" is not so bad, it's good; is simply bad. Absolutely terrible.
