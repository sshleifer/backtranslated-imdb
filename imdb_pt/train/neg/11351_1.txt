With MASSIVE advertising, this is getting into Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and that sort of thing, my son was bothering us to see. Between the DVD and the movie theaters, I've seen pretty much everything from the excellent (Incredibles, Shrek) to the very bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was easily the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or no kids. It was a "when will this stupid thing end?" kind of experience? Ok, it's meant for young children (or better be insulting to the intelligence of someone over 3 years old), but I've never seen something so predictable, repetitive and slow. So when you're finally tired but relieved that the movie is over, there's a bizarre thing in the end that you think is setting up a joke, but there's not one - it's serious, although it's hard to say what they're trying to accomplish . The 3-D effects ... yes, if you have never seen a Viewmaster, they are a big problem, otherwise not (if you look at the screen without glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son was bored at the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" in the end. Bad in every way.
