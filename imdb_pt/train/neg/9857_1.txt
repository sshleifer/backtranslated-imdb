I just watched this movie and found it was basically not funny at all. <br /> <br /> I'm an RPG (computer type, none of the DnD desktop accessories), but I did not find any of the jokes <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes seemed to drag a lot ( tilt and zoom could have been cut in 5 seconds instead of a minute) and it looks like the director was just trying to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting itself was not so bad, about the standard that a B-movie should have. <br /> <br /> I would suggest not to bother with this movie, unless you are a big fan of DnD, and even then it would probably be best to avoid it.
