Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I always mean it. My wife and I were bored out of our minds within 10 minutes. Not to mention boring, it's totally unbelievable. Women (not lesbians) do not bathe together - nor do they "accidentally" kiss. Brothers and sisters do not live together until the age of 30 and they run from one place to another dancing together and getting involved in races in the central park. The men do not discover that the wife and sister kiss romantically the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with their wife. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in the movies today. She smiles when she should be crying and vice versa. The only movie she's ever been good at is Boogie Nights - and that's because she was not acting. <br /> <br /> I can not emphasize how bad this movie was.
