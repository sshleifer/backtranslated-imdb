I'll keep it quick and sweet. Five girls on the way home from a football game decide to make a 'shortcut' that takes them to a deserted forest road. Of course, nothing but good things happen to them, and they arrive safely at their destination. <br /> <br /> All right, they do not. Soon they are pursued by a demented girl who has serious mental problems, and what follows is 90 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope to never see any of these actors in any movie again. Their screaming, shrill voices gave me a headache, and the script was so poorly written that it included many repeated phrases and nonsensical hysterical screams. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
