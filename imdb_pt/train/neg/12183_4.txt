Christ. A sequel to one of the most sickening movies of all time, at least it has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but continues the tradition of being nauseating and bland. This time, Annie and her friends go to London and are caught in the plot of Joan Collins to blow up Buckingham Palace or something. The film has a bizarrely symphonic attitude towards its homonymous character, at odds with how annoying it is: every time the little grunt shouts "Leapin 'lizards!" I could feel my teeth turning to dust. Dreafully photographed, slushy and toiling, the film has only one memorable line ("Unhand me, its stupid genius!") And the fact that it is not the original to recommend it.
