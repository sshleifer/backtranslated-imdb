After reading many of the reviews, I do not know the movie that some people were watching but clearly was not the same as I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. The acting, especially of Moore, is simply terrible. The woman can not act. Nice breasts, but she just can not act. At no point did she come across the real character. Instead, it was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make-believe with the boys. <br /> <br /> And that's what this movie finally is - Hollywood does. The training sequences are at the top. Politics - on top. The political correctness - on top. The combat scenes - you guessed it, on top. Your mission is to enter and exit undetected. So, what you do? Why shoot so many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. Oh G.I Jane, you can be my wing man at any time. <br /> <br /> The premise is good, but as soon as Hollywood gets it, we end up with the Top Gun with breasts. <br /> <br /> What else is expected of US commercial films? Not much, I guess.
