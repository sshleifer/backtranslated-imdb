This movie is not funny. It just picks up the nerdy D & D stereotypes and amplifies them. All main characters earn less than 30,000 a year, all live with their parents, are all socially retarded and have no luck with women. The jokes are horrible and unimaginative, like two of the players being beaten by a black dwarf because one of them had a KKK hood (it was his wizard costume) and the other had a John Rocker warming up (oh how funny he is a nerd, so he does not know about sports). You may have to be a junior high school to find anything funny. Poorly made masks are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to do. I'm sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I think these are the only opportunities available to the cats that have passed from their peak.
