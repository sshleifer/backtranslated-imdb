Well, what can I say about this movie? I'm speechless. I could talk about how stupid this movie is forever, though the only thing that REALLY got me was the song. And on top of that someone commented on how much they LIKED it. For them, all I have to say is that it was stolen from one of the greatest martial arts films of all time - Fists of Fury, starring Bruce Lee. If he was still alive and found this movie, he would be horrified. the rest of the film is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say tape because a movie like that could not have been filmed on film. Now I feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching. The only reason I even saw this was because my roommate lowered him out of morbid curiosity. Where this world will stop.
