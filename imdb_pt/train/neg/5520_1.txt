This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It's an extreme tragedy. It made me sick to my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like that, they should be men enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would not have seen this movie if I'd known. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I'm tired of this. I really wanted to have a funny comedy and I'm extremely disappointed. It's been several days and I still have a bad taste in the mouth of this movie. I've never been more disappointed in a movie, nor have I ever written a comment about a bad movie. I really think the real mistake was involved in this trailer, because if they showed the true intent of the movie, no one would have seen it.
