This is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie movie I've ever had the misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of the filmmaker, the family of filmmakers or a friend of the filmmaker. How bad is this movie? Let's count the ways ... <br /> <br /> The plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I'm not going to hit the effects / gore, as I understand this is low budget. But was there even a zombie who was not obese? Come on! And for a movie set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts license plate? Continuity, find some. <br /> <br /> The girl dancing while the soldier "stands out". Please do not put your ex girlfriend or sister of your friend in your naked movie. This was an ugly movie full of ugly people, and has no business mentioning Romero on the cover. The next time you decide to make a movie, do not do it.
