If there ever was a comedy worse than "Gray Matters," I'm not aware of that. The premise of the New York Jewish comedy is that the brothers Sam and Gray are confused with a couple and decide to get a girlfriend for Sam, but they discover that Gray is equally attracted to his target - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive marriage sequence, a deeply embarrassing 'drunkenness' of Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that would shame forests everywhere for its ardor of Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this drawn from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen indifference. Only Alan Cumming comes up with any credit, but is seriously underemployed and receives nothing to work with. The whole mess is cemented by Graham's bizarre performance, culminating in the penultimate scene in which she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat, despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar. It is amazing that this movie has been released, has no rescue and should be avoided at all costs.
