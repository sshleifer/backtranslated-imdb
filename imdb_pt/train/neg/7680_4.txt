Snow White is, in my opinion, a bad movie from the artistic point of view. The plot is practically predictable, the characters are stereotypes, the edition too exaggerated. Anyway, the film does not seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think this is a direct business thing. Including a character from the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the band that he is touring in the film - the band called SENS UNIK) seems to target a larger audience. A direct German-Swiss film would not have sold in the French part - and vice versa. What really pissed me off were the product placements throughout the film. Some remembered scenes from advertising clips! <br /> <br /> I also think that the topic "young people taking drugs with no other target in their lives" is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be elaborated more carefully. I hope Samir has enough money with Snow White, so that his next film shows his true artistic abilities.
