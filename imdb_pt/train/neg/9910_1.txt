One of the worst movies of all time. Not funny, poor TV style cinematography, bad acting. It's sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, let alone act. Female leader Nancy Young can not act. Terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Occasional fragile jokes are weak. Even the basic premise of the film makes no sense. Somehow, they must prevent a marriage from happening, but there is no logic behind their actions. The slow pace made my wife stop watching, but I suffered from it. Older men should be acting like they were young and horny, but that sounds pathetic rather than funny. How did they get the money to do this?
