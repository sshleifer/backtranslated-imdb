Apparently this is what happens when a director lets his 14-year-old nephew rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges in alcohol in the meantime; As I said earlier, although I always wanted to take one of Paul Naschy's werewolf photos, this atrocity served as my introduction and, as terrible as that, I still intend to seek other appearances in the series, albeit very gradually. Despite some disappointments such as Joe Dante's THE HOWLING (1981), I love werewolf pictures in general, but to be honest, I quickly lost interest in the plot of this film and stood staring at my TV screen telling its absurdities as They were. There were many to mention here, but I must say that two that I found particularly hilarious were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf persona (for example, moving from a furious beast in one shot to a confused state and zombie in the next - as if he was on an informal midnight walk in the country, and sporting a completely different wardrobe ... and yes, I already knew the reasons for it beforehand), just as the "Phantom of the Opera" looks from the character Wolfstein ! But what I do know - perhaps the elusive version of this mess might well have been a bona fide horror classic!
