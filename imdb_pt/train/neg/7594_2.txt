Given the director's story of this film, it's hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit on. I was in the European premiere last night and one of the Executive Producers was there. He was still to see the movie and, boy, he was in for a surprise. I did not read the book on which this is based, nor do I know if it is highly rated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Correlli's Mandolin" and given how bad he was adapted to the screen and how bad that movie was, I can just suppose something similar happened here. The performance was not bad, although there were many eyebrows raised by Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe how little I cared about any character in this movie. Situations appear on the screen in an empty sequence of nothing. Donald Sutherland's part comprises some scenes in which he opens a door, says something and closes again. I kept looking at the clock when I was not shrinking from the dialogue on the screen. I've never been out of a movie, but I've been tempted to get started during this. I gave this movie a '2' rating for reasons that look terribly shallow for me, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek was naked and beautiful. I can say a little more positive about this movie. Do not ask anything, you can not talk!
