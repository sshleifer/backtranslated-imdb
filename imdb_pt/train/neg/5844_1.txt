This movie is easily one of the worst I have ever seen. And I do not mean that in a good way. We wanted to see a horror / low quality thriller, so we chose what looked like the worst of the store. For the first time, the film was everything we had hoped for. And more! (or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors seem to be reading their lines of posters behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by placing transparent red plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of the murderous rats. And the script? Do not even tell me about the script ... And when you thought it could not get any worse, the first part of the movie was Oscar material compared to the end. <br /> Take it from me, this movie is hilarious if you like bad horror movies, but if you want a GOOD movie, keep looking. This is not for you.
