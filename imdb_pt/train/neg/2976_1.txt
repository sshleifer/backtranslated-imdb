Miraculously, this is really very watchable. I mean, it's bad. This is really bad. But while the original was so bad that it's ruining my life, that's too bad, it's just not fun. Okay, that's compliment weak enough. The production values ​​are spoiled, the performance is excruciating and Romero's satire can not decide which side of the ecology fence is mocking. The internal logic gets in the background in the heads, propelling themselves out of the fridges, the incubation times of the virus floating as the 'plot' requires, bullets working against the zombies or not, the zombies having the power of speech or not. Gore is the draw, obviously, but the structure is so careless that it's annoying. The dialogue seems to have been translated by the same computers that manipulate the instruction manuals, and the scale of the zombie infestation is not implicit in the naivety of Romero's films. It's all culminated with a horrendous synth score. Absolute garbage.
