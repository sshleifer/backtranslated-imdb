Shortly after seeing this movie, I questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a laudable actress, why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? I must give credit where credit is due, however. Some moments of the film were unpredictable and quite transfixing, but they hardly compensated the perverse and forceful tendencies of the personage of Kevin Bacon, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, male or female, who has any form of self-respect to explain.
