this movie delivers. the best is when the clumsy teenage neighbor tries to pull away from the nanny and in the background it seems like he has never been near a bike in his life while trying not to fall. <br /> <br /> But this movie does not stop there, when less than 5 minutes later it offers a scene of nothing more than an arm passing by a fence and a refrigerator pulling a beer. <br /> <br /> Stereotyped parents, many no-holds-barred plots, and a former seaquest actress with bluetooth cell phones all contribute to making the perfect Saturday night at home.
