In Fiji, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests to an opening party of their complex comprised of hotel and zoo with the aim of finding partners for their discoveries. When a bunch of small college thieves puts a virus in the security system to join a hunt, the zoo's biggest attractions? sabretoothes from the prehistoric era developed from DNA found in fossils ?? escape, killing the hosts and guards for pleasure. <br /> <br /> The incredibly lame and cheap "Saber Tooth Attack" is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. The characters are horrible and not funny or pleasant, and the story is a terrible swipe at Jurassik Park with a bad collection of cliches. Basically all the lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabristas are bulimic and like to kill for pleasure. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Attack of the Tooth of Knowledge" ("The Attack of the Sabretooth Teeth")
