To tell you the truth, I'm a bit stunned to see all these positive reviews from many people, which is also the main reason why I really decide to see this movie. And after seeing it, I was really disappointed, and this comes from the guy who loves this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I'm surprise in this movie completely - it's like a child's movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involves children cursing and cursing. I'm not fair at all, but that really went too far on my account. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The story about two guys was sent to the Big Brother show for their reckless behavior. There they met a child with an obsession with breasts and the other is a medieval aberration. <br /> <br /> Only the name is not really related to the story. They are not being a role model and do nothing but serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (although expected) and the mood is lame. And we have not seen the same characters (played by Mc Lovin) in so many other films (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laughed three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, the cast was fine, after all, he's the one who produces the script. And the acting is so expected when you watch that kind of movie. And the direction, what is expected? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and this movie sucks too. But somehow he always managed to bring some star to lure his horrendous movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway I did not feel total riff, but a total waste of time. Only the bare scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. I really do not see any reason to recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Cons: Not funny, terrible story, nudity and kids do not mix. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (rating: F)
