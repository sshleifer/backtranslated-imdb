A pitifully and painfully bland attempt to transplant Sheriff Bart's character from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles into his weekly sitcom, this is as bad as some people say it is! <br /> <br /> serves only to remind the unsophisticated viewer what all this supposed comedy purports to be a joke and how desperate for laughs really is! <br /> <br /> However, it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to represent Little Cleavon. His embarrassment transpires in every scene. He was much funnier in the HBO movie El Diablo than he was here in this slice of cheese! <br /> <br /> Really the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of your horse!
