There is no need to detail what others have written in other reviews - here's the summary: Much of the nested animation work is absolutely beautiful - the colors are excellent - would love to have it done in silk like a tie <br /> <br /> * The story and execution is a total snooze - it was very difficult to stay awake at times <br /> <br /> If you are a student of fine arts, medieval calligraphy, religion precocious and so on - have it for that. This is a MOVIE for you. <br /> <br /> If you want an engaging and entertaining MOVEMENT - look elsewhere - this is a failure as something other than an artistic statement. <br /> <br /> Vikings did not like it. I have no horns on the way ...
