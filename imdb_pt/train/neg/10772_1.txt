The saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes I will never go back. I knew this was terrible from the start, with the guy dressed as a lunatic Indian chief at the top of the roof. (See if they could get away with this in 2008). My 10 year old boy is really in love with baseball now so we decided to rent it out on a rainy day. Even though he seemed to like parts, I had to shrink when I heard all the unnecessary language. Bad and bad movie. This was a terrible trait of Bad News Bears. Completely shameless and completely predictable. I do not care about a predictable movie if it's well done, but this was not at all.
