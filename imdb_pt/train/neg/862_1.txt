'Succubus', the edited version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to sit, even in 76 minutes; plus this horrendous and pretentious stink of the Euro horror and I may have gotten into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again delivers a really horrible piece of 60's trash that seems to have been made by a cast and crew out of their heads in Class A hallucinogens, since not a second of this mess made any sense. Apparently, is this one of the best of his 180 films? it is hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there. The unfathomable plot deals with Franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism and plays a little S & M as a measure, yet still succeeds in remaining tediously boring mind. <br /> <br /> Can I leave it long before I enter the world of Euro Horror dishonest again? life is too short to be spent watching a basement like this.
