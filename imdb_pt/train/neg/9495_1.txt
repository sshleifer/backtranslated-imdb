This is a terrible movie, and no scene has an ounce of sincere emotion. The characters are uninflected, obviously drawn, predictable and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wish fulfillment. <br /> <br /> William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 when this movie was made, but he's playing someone in his early 40's and it looks like he's in his 60s. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found on the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection. The character of Holden - the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film, (not) coincidentally - is pitched with obvious pitfalls of the pre-hippie 60's cool: the bachelor pad, the hi- fi, lunch at Yamashiro. But the movie is ridiculously uncool, a claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing the free spirits they saw at Sunset and at Laurel Canyon to find them and their great sexy cars. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Young culture has never been so desperate. And I shudder to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for youth that he took on this embarrassing role.
