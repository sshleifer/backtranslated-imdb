"Drawing Restraint 9" is a movie you love or hate; fortunately or not, left her with a strong sense of time-wasting and being completely clogged with the "killing whales is bad" propaganda. Aesthetically, the film could have been enjoyable, especially in the first half, until it is not clear that each action portrayed serves as an allegory of various aspects of whaling. Until then, it may be a little fun to look at the daily chores of Japanese workers, but then it becomes obvious that anything that pops up on the screen is an advertisement, and no single box is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film basically uses the old gameplay mechanism of morality, where "good" and "bad" are not deduced in the course of action, but are engraved in stone. It's probably just me, but I find this kind of superficial and preconceived art, even when it's all about the noble (without sarcasm here) seeking to protect the environment. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is a fundamental sin. when a film material is stretched without any justification, just for stretching. In my opinion, "Drawing Restraint 9" could have been easily docked in 75 minutes but has a torturous length of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting pictures, but there was not enough to leave 15-minute breaks without realizing it. The film has no standard scenario, and there is no character evolution, but neither is it a documentary, it's a kind of conceptual installation. This is an uncommon form for a film, but it can still be seen as art even when the concept is as simple and naive as it is here. OTOH I also believe that the director should have had some honesty and did not pretend that it could only be delivered in no less than 135 minutes. <br /> <br /> And yes, the score reminded me of more whale sounds. How amazing. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
