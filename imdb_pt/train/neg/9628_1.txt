This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The DVD was delivered to me for free with an order I placed online for items not related to DVDs. <br /> <br /> No wonder they were donated, surely no one could get undone with money because of this. <br /> <As some critics might say they found the beggars' belief hilarious, the person who included them in the worst five films ever saw it. <br /> <br /> As a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman? could get involved in this garbage is unbelievable. Mostly toilet humor and poorly done in that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to be entertained should avoid this at any cost.
