Debbie Reynolds hits with her feet, tangos and, yes, they dance in tap dance in this common thriller that has a distinctly fabricated 1930s atmosphere. Two ladies, reunited when their children commit a murder, try to start their lives by running a children's tap dance school in Hollywood. The problem is that one of them is plagued by neuroses. Can you imagine it 10 years ago with Robert Aldrich directing Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? Nahh, Bette would never have allowed Joan so much time on screen to display her things, and I can not imagine Bette Davis in the other role, dancing with her heart. This is a purely macabre play, written by Henry Farrell (whose idea of ​​a good "shock" is to stage the mass murder of a group of rabbits!). There is an ounce of honest fun throughout the tepid bundle. * 1/2 of ****
