this movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more graphic than both, and not as good as the others. It is also slow and fairly predictable. It also has Deliverance tones and the Amityville Horror.plus, we have a new old flavor, and some of these scenes come up as a motivational / inspirational sermon. Actually, this movie is a mix of almost everything. Even if it is bloody, the makeup effects are not very realistic. in fact, they look kind of cheap. On top of all this, there is a really awful clich√© dialogue. And I will not say when, but there is a point where some of the character's actions were not authentic or believable given the circumstances. no one in their right mind would have acted that way. After watching the movie, you'll know what I mean. There is also some free nudity because of nudity. It simply was not necessary. The good news is that acting was really very good. Better than this movie deserves s.so, after carefully weighing the evidence, id say that this film was passable but not good. My verdict from The Tooth fairy: 4 / 10
