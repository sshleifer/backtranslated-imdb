This is a very bad western, mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like it was filmed on a lot in California, instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, Idaho, Colorado Territories and Montana. It fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious "bad man", "good man". The script is horrible; there is very little direction and bad performance. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife. Mark Steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good stage line superintendent. He was feared by his local residents for his heavy consumption. When drunk, he started fights and caused other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To ensure that he never again terrified them, the vigilantes lynched Jack Slade after he ignored the warning to leave town immediately. This is a horrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how Hollywood pursues history at will until today.
