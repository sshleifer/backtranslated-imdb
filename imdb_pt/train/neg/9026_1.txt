This has to be one of the worst directions I've ever seen. The close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when all the scenes consist of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some beautiful scenery to work on, the Mexican scenery, the canteens, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty cities that Costner travels through his revenge journey. Unfortunately, we only glimpsed these locations before the camera cut the image of a large giant head. Even the transition scenes in which Costner is driving alone through Mexico quickly dwindle to a close-up. <br /> <br /> The result is super-dramatic and intrusive, dictating all the emotions we should feel. The story itself should have been treated much better. Among other things, many people come out of nowhere to help Costner - it's just a poor writing. <br /> <br /> It's a typical suspense story, but many others have adopted the same premise and done excellent things with it. Costant's No Way Out had a somewhat similar storyline, but it was a much better film. <br /> <br /> The ending was completely anticlimactic and suffered from the movie's most melodramatic score. This movie would never be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and fewer giant heads, this movie could have been watched.
