I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's basically to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme but fails miserably. It always seems that it was written and represented by high school kids on some school project, and that is also the level that humor seems to aim at. There is subtlety and, more forcefully for a mockumentary, it never feels like a documentary. And although the lines are not funny at first, an attempt to deliver a dead tray would have helped - surely, anything would be better than the strident stratification to which we are subjected. <br /> <br /> d would recommend this to people who like "comedies" in the vein of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; people who think words like "butt" are inherently hysterically funny. Other people should stay away and not waste their time.
