Spoiler notice. <br /> <br /> When the main character's sister is pushed up the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her to make it look like she's drinking. But just before she was killed, she tells her sister's business partner (Teri Garr) on the phone that she did not drink in 4 days. However, the police never mention the results of a toxicology report! And the characters talk about her being drunk when she went downstairs. There is? Really bad mistake in this movie, which is pretty awful in general. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad considering the big cast. Some flaws: the writing is not very good, the music is made for bad TV, and there is no tension at all, because we already know the answer to the mystery of the first scene of the film.
