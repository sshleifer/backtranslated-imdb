This was one of the worst movies ever !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was laughing the whole movie! The plot was so tacky; especially the end. This movie goes from a disaster of the end of the world to save the eels! I mean, come on! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eels! And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who divorced. How predictable! It was SO terrible that my mother, my sister and I could not finish, and when we finished, it was about a year later! The second time we watched and finished this time, we made similar comments to MST3K throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Summary: Just watch this if you're a movie destroyer! Make hilarious comments, watch this at a pajama party to laugh at, and I mean HUGE laughs. Also watch the mockery. The metaphor that explains this movie: This movie is a very shallow field full of half and cheese puppets!
