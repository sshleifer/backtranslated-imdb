The Django Ballad is a twisting mess of a movie! This western spaghetti is simply a collection of other scenes (and much better!) Movies supposedly linked by "Django" telling how he brought different thugs. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) brings nothing to the role of Django. Skip this one unless you have to make all the Django movies made, and even this may not be a good enough excuse to see this!
