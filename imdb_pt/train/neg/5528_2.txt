With this movie running only 61 minutes and nothing so good on television, I decided to put the zombie revolt on the DVD to pass the time. Even as I realized the age from which I came, I was very disappointed. It started with the strangely optimistic quality of the opening score (what - no litter music?) And then the opening sequences rather slow. Wow, I figured a zombie movie - even from the 1930s - would have ANY shivers (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi certainly did), but that did not have any. Zero. It was not at all dramatic (except for the few moments with burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate someone's mesmerization). As the equally tedious King of the Zombies, this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own, but nothing more.
