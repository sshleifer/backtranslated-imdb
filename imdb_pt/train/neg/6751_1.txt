My boyfriend and I rented this because we thought it might be a good Halloween takeoff. A murderer who terrorizes the young, a white mask ... you understand me. We were completely wrong! No pun intended. We not only discovered one of the worst movies out there but also that it's a cult classic! It's full of holes and does not make sense. The actress who plays Maddy is beautiful, but that's about it. I give credit for it being made on a very low budget - I always offer films like that. Just not this one in particular. <br /> <br /> This movie might be good to see if you are drunk or loud; otherwise, do not bother. Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like I did!
