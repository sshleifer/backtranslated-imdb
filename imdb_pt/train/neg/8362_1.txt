This is a really bad movie. I packed my brain and could not make a positive comment to make. The acting is atrocious. I've seen more credible performances in cable access. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, the President's secret recordings, and a shark attacking anything approaching him should have been made for extravagant fun at worst. Night of the Sharks is not so bad, it's good. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before being filmed. And on top of that, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm surprised my ears have not begun to bleed from the synthesized techno sounds of the 80's that someone really cared about recording. <br /> <br /> From everything I read, the Italian film industry was dead in 1987. Sharks night is like a last nail in the coffin.
