I never really thought a movie could be so atrocious, but I was wrong. Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible effects. The Crocodile was horrible and as for the stupid sex scene / kill all in one, that was a bad move from the start. It was truly shocking and this is not a compliment! As someone can do this movie, watch it back and then really say, "Yeah, this is a good movie. People will watch it" If you have not seen it yet, I beg you DO NOT DO :-(
