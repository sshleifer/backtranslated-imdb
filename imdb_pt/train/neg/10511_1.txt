Note to Horror Fans: The only horror here is when you realized that you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that is so useless that it's an insult. <br /> <br /> I watched this because: <br /> <br /> <br /> The premise sounded slightly promising: it is not. It's just an excuse to use the same bits of other low budget movies that were not good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of nymphs from the bare forest sounded cool even if the movie turned out to be awful: it is not. It's not like this. Amateur cinematography ensures that "fallen angels" are as sexy as the average homeless person. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: he is the king of low-budget special effects. and lower operating budget. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been milking this in horror conventions ever since. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Obviously, the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. That's all given after the first 10 minutes. But the step without notion; the way the director treats "plot" and "characterization" as a nuisance that he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the extremely long and boring conduction, walking, and nature sequences (undoubtedly added to increase runtime to make the film eligible for distribution) show a complete lack of fitness for filmmaking and narrative in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad: if it's written and directed by the same person, wait for rubbish.
