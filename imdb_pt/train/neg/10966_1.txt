A friend once told me that an independent art film ran in a movie theater when - at the close of the film - the audiences were so enraged they had to tear up the movie seats. Naturally, my imagination went wild, trying to evoke the content of such work. Well, now my imagination can be put aside. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Andrei Tarkovky and a fervent admirer of his work. I came across many people who thought that Tarkovsky's films were slow and inert. Being the opinions that they are, I discovered that this does not apply to the wonderful works of the deceased director, who are elaborated with meaning, beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions. Upon hearing Aleksandr Sokurov call Tarkovsky's heir, I was excited to try out his films. <br /> <br /> Aside from the cross-country walk through the fields (Stalker), this film has no kinship with anything Tarkovsky has. done. It does not seem to have the slightest meaning even on a completely meaningless level. It is supposed that cinematography "incredibly glaring" is devoid of any compositional craft. There is no balance, there is no proportion, and the exposure meter seems to be running low on frozen snow. The main character is so inept and indecisive, it makes you wonder if his father could be alive if he decided on it first. <br /> <br /> I am also not adverse to plots or stories that progress in various non-linear ways. But there is not even a no-story here. One must certainly get into the showing of this movie with a shaved head if someone comes out with nothing gained and nothing lost, since pulling their hair would be the only possible answer to a rhythm that could make a sculpture of Tarkosky's time look as if Jerry Bruckheimer had filmed a Charlie Chaplin short. <br /> <br /> I will not rule out that this may be one of Sokurov's stinkers (Solaris of Tarkovsky), but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky's heirs based on this movie. - would be to call Paris Hilton as Aristotle's successor. Come on guys, do not be afraid to say that. No amount of awesome big words will magically bring this celluloid corpse back to life. I do not profess to fully understand Russian culture and probably do not have Russian values, but I immediately took on Tarkovsky's work as something magical, a treasure and a gift to the audience. <br /> <br /> I did not have Sokurov's name, and it went on to say, Saturday Night Live, that I'm sure no one would "read" all those magnificent reviews on this wet noodles from a movie.
