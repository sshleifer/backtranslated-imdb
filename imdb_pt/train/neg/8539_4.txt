This engaging (what should not be) low grade Spanish exploration (fairly meek that I might add) looks good, but huh? Let me say that again, huh? In fact, the word "huh?" would be going through your mind enough. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try. I just do not know if it's complicated, puzzling or just a confusing mess, but there's no denying how laconically monotonous, strange, and long-winded it seems. unrelated sequences (like that nasty opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by John Caffari, who has a mustache and is an idiot for the iconic Mario who is leaving his girlfriend at home and meets a young lady (a beautiful Patty Shepard) that he asks to go with him in a photography job, where in this remote hideaway in the mountains they meet some witches hooded sweatshirts. Look beyond the structure of the messy plot and have fun. which is simply a moody mechanism of atmospheric mechanisms and increasing discomfort. Raul Artigot directs few unusual visuals and sinister passages, but mostly seems sporadically non-existent and out of focus as his writing. Ramon Sempere's impressive cinematography presents the graciously rich scenery while enjoying the panoramic views and letting the time relax. However, there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was happening. The astonishingly bombastic and exaggerated scandal of Fernando Garc√≠a Morcillo mixes terribly with the compulsively dense atmosphere created. Leaders are capable, but there is also a strong side (the choice being Victor Israel) of secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Slow with little in terms of interest, but this dreamy setting (which seems to go on and so on) manages to keep him watching until his closing.
