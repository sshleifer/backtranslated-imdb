As a history buff who is particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed with the film. Granted, the costumes and staging were completely authentic, but the Hollywood portrait of this "Great Little British Horn" was truly boring. <br /> <br /> The amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops must have been unprecedented in film history. Eveytime I heard triumphant background music begin, I knew I had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filling. Obviously, the producers had invested heavily in "staging" and were determined to get the value of their money. Despite the excellent cast, his dialogue was again tedious and his characters never developed. Whenever Peter O'Toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I would shiver with disappointment. Their lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe they were the same two great actors who played Lawrence of Arabia and the Birdman of Alcatraz, respectively. <br /> <br /> There are worse epics, but this is not much better.
