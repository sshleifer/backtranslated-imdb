I have this DVD for over 2 years and I just decided to watch it yesterday. I do not know why it took me as long as I like the Inspector Gadget program and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. While it may have a vivid color palette and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated film, there are some old things missing from this gadget in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> First of all, the classical theme of Inspector Gadget music and music is completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by making a score that sounds similar but is still not good enough. The Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. In addition, it looks much more beautiful and rounder than simple. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent. There's something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw using it for some evil never revealed, but that's all I have. What was the problem with the short / giant Italian guy I'll never know. It has nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the title is something to go by, your last case is not at all. And it continues in force, so why it is called the 'last case' is also a mystery. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed. This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD, but do not let that lead you to buy any DVD of the Inspector Gadget that you can. I sold this just a few seconds after I finally watched it. No child will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerance.
