This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I bought the DVD and it did not work, well the DVD worked well, it's just the movie, not really that bad I think the actors have not worked since (or before judging by the acting). There is no real plot to speak and no real horror. Production figures are rubbish, even for a low budget movie, with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to the wind in the microphone. <br /> <br /> In short, it was such a bad movie that a viewer could think it was. will turn into a porn if they know nothing better (which was an improvement). There are only two lines in the movie that are funny, which revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly deserve to watch every 76 minutes for) <br /> <br /> As for the commercialization of the DVD I feel completely cheated. I mean, reading the back, I hoped it was bad: <br /> <br /> He chose his weapons. He selected his victims. He picked up his nose. He turned into a girl! <br /> <br /> But I thought it might be funny. Also the case states that it is digitally remastered, I would love to have seen it beforehand, the print is so grainy that you could use it as sandpaper. The case also says that it is an absolute disgusting movie, IN WHAT SHAPE ?, disgusting production, acting. <br /> <br /> This movie comes out welcome in the first five minutes, (if you are thinking of buying it I say buy 'bad taste' instead it's a much better movie and it's funny, there's also Peter Jackson , the director of LOTR.) <br /> <br /> Incidentally, if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since then, please post here how I would like to know, just to find out if there's a worse movie out there, or if anyone in this movie ever cared to learn how to act
