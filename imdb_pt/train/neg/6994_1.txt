When I went and saw this movie, I had high expectations. But I was so wrong. This movie was just like all the other horror movies. It is a virus, zombies, etc. Exactly like Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this, and other movies, is that the story is very week. They are bad actors and boring music. The picture is good, but the rest is total crap. Do not watch this movie of "terror", go see Ring 2 or any other movie that is much more of a story. I hope they stop making horror movies that have a virus and that the virus spreads and drives people to zombies. We've seen enough of that. The only good thing in the movie is when they are standing on the roof and filming famous and infected celebrities.
