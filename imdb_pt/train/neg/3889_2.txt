I always wanted to see this because I love horror movies and with a title like that, I was sure "The Incredible Melting Man" would be a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> It really was not. I mean, the acting was hilariously bad, the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had splashed across the main actor so I should have loved it. Unfortunately it is very complicated among these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return. This is how the movie is boring. <br /> <br /> However, if you like bad movies, you'll enjoy the dramatic exit of Fat Nurse and the stellar performance of the guy who plays Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor man, he has to deliver some surprisingly ineffective lines with serious face - like the conversation he has with his wife in tracking the IM Man: "I'll meet you with a geiger counter ". "Is he radioactive?" "Just a little." <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has Dr. Ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what appears to be a mini-Dyson. He is a brave man. Unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a lot of goo in a tree. "Oh god - it's his ear!" says Dr. Ted to the audience. I'm so glad he made it clear. <br /> <br /> I realize that I'm making this movie seem like a lot of fun. It would have been only 10 minutes long but unfortunately it goes on and on and Incredible Melting Dude only thinks about making a sticky mess when it should be eating more people in my opinion. I think if you were really stoned you would probably love it, just would not have pop-tarts during the movie because the lead actor really looks like one near the end.
