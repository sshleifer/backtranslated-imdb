Realistic movie, of course, except the characters do not look frightened. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he does not seem to want to. That's why I do not like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger is again playing a soldier. No good emotion, realistic sequences. Not always shooting, that's great. Well filmed. I hate the helicopter sequence because only one terrorist kills almost all the marine band ... I give him ** and a half off the pussy
