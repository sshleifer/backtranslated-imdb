Mad Magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for this ... but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers-that-be-reneged this waste of celluloid ... the edition is el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid ... and the only reason she gets two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes some of her clothes off and we take a good picture of her chest ... I never thought I'd feel sorry for Ralph Macchio making the decision to be Nessa , but I do ... and I really feel bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, talented actors who should never have appeared in this movie ... at least Mr. Leibman had the cajones for refusing to have his name put on any place in the movie ... and it comes out the front ... there are copies of this thing with Mad's initial sequence yet ... if you can locate one, get it because it's probably worth something ... it's the only thing about this movie worth anything ... and a note to the people al of the ... there is no way to ruin this movie for Someone ... the manufacturers ruined everything by themselves ...
