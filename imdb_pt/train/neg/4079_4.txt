I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this movie, and likes movies about the paranormal. The film was filmed entirely on video, so it has the look of a PBS special on it. The special effects are very similar, but in fact there are some scary moments in the movie that made us jump in our seat. There is a particularly effective scare involving a statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the "plot" scenes are long and very boring, and I'll tell you that I have no idea what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, please make sure you pay less than $ 5.
