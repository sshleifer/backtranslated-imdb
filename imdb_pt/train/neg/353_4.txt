As other reviewers have noted, the movie dies in the last half hour. However, before that, she suffers from predictability and an incredibly insipid performance of Kate Capshaw, who has clearly never encountered her character and destroys every scene in which she is. Connery is just like Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect, rather than true. with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The filmmakers apparently knew when they got this mess that all they needed was sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to make Thanksgiving dinner, so that, to make up for it, they added an excessively high "dramatic" score. Each small leap is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable. If you want a bad movie example from the major league, this is one to watch, otherwise skip it.
