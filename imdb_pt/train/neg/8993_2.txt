In the '70s, when I first saw this, I was in high school. It was cool then. Now, as an adult, I look back and say to myself ... right. What was so funny? It has its moments, but they are few and far between. It is so dated that the jokes do not hold up any longer. Show this to a younger audience and they will be totally lost. If you like this kind of mood you may want to stick with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. Tunnel Vision, like Groove Tube, is too old for today's view.
