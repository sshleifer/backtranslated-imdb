Oh gosh. Some of the best British TV talent made this series, and so I can only assume they were working under incredible time pressure, and had to settle for the first scenes of many scenes. <br /> <br /> scenes in this Highland mystery (especially when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid that I found most of the story without funny intent! Just like the moment the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand there ... hmm, that's a little confusing ... <br /> For many years fans of British cult TV programs have campaigned for this series to be released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
