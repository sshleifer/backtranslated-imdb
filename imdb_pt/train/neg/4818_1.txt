I was about 7 when this MONSTROSITY DIRECT from a movie was released. In the UK, it was announced on TV in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were an incredible blockbuster movie. In fact, it was the first movie I ever seen in a movie theater, and I was put off for years to come. The following week, I was invited to go see the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. To this day I've never seen this, in protest of having to watch Sasquatch! Honestly, even at age 7, I realized I was seeing trash. It's so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Absurd discords that should NEVER have reached a movie theater. However, I enjoyed reading all those years after the director never drove again, as well as I'm worried. AVOID ALL THE COSTS !!!
