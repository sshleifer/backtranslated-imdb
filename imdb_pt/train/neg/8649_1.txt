This movie fails miserably on all levels. I have an idea, let's get everyone involved in this movie and send them to a hot spot in the Middle East. Perhaps, if we are lucky, everyone will be shot and killed and we will no longer have to waste our time with them. Did I mention that I've never been so bitter about a filthy pile of crap in my whole life? God, I can not think of anything I've seen that was so bad. I would rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit 10 minutes away from this excuse for a movie. If I happen to meet someone who's involved in this movie, I'll spit in their faces and then beat them up senseless. These are my two cents.
