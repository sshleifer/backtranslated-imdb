Of course, a lot of people really like this, but I find it cool and offensive, gravely obfuscated, saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and some memorable musical numbers, especially the opening (but there is a sharp drop in invention later). I do not get on well with Monroe - she should be playing a silly blonde who is not that stupid, but she only appears like an idiot. Russell can not convince when she claims to have never been to a gym, but it is otherwise wonderful. Men are incredibly uninteresting, just like the plot. Not atrocious, but so unequal, that if this is a classic, God help us all.
