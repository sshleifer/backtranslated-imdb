Runners of time. The movie you can watch, if you are looking for a sophisticated way to suicide. Some use guns, ropes or gas, but you want to ruin your brain? Do not wait! Time runners are probably one of the biggest possible mistakes: thinking that Christian Clavier is capable of acting and bringing fun to you. I do not miss the 45 francs that this poor thing cost me: sometimes, you need to redefine your rating system by looking at absolute zero. This movie deserves a 2/10, but that's only because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also stars in Ronin. I do not think I'm going to like him ...
