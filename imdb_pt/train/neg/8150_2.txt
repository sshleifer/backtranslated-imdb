If you want a little demanding and reasonably fun time then it's okay to watch it. Not really bad, actually. Yes, there are more lapses in logic than I would like to describe here, and it can overwhelm the patience of people - as I have to admit - who are inclined to play things on TV from time to time, but it's funny at least. Just because it's not always INTENTIONALLY funny, there's no need to let it bother you. <br /> <br /> However, if you have read the book - or any of the other Brookmyre books - then you probably better avoid it. I've read them all and when I watched this movie, I despised it. I destroy it in detail and to a great extent on another site, in fact. The TV plot has virtually no relevance to the book and served only to anger and infuriate many faithful (and admittedly rabid) fans of Brookmyre. <br /> <br /> The best advice ...? Look at this, then read the book and only then make your comparisons and submit your judgment.
