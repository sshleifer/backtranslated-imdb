Stalker is right! Girl pretends to be a patient, girl can not stop talking about him, girl pretends to love another guy (or two), girl pretends to be a patient, girl pretends to love another guy, he does not pay attention to her because she's annoying, girl STILL will not leave him alone. Played correctly, Drake's character might have been charming, but she's completely, relentless in her pursuit of Cary Grant's character, her girlfriend in dogs is boring, and unfortunately Drake's attempt to play, "charmingly crazy" comes as "disturbingly insane". Grant is himself, as usual, which is good for Cary, but it's the closest to a phone call performance I've seen him. The direction is mediocre and the dialogue is simply gloomy. <br /> <br /> The Screwball comedy is very difficult to be successfully performed and when it fails, as in this unsuccessful attempt at a try, it just stinks. Worse yet, Drake spends the entire film needing a lot of Valium and a restraining order. It spoils any mood that can be found in this drier region than the mummy's dust relic.
