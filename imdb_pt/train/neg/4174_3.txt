Whoo-boy, this was definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. Granted, it was on Sci Fi, and I do not watch Sci Fi too much, but dude, talk about a razor-thin plot and two-dimensional characters to the max. The characters were stereotyped and exaggerated, the plot and scenario were unbelievable, vampires were less intimidating, funnier, blood was unnecessary, special effects were horrible and the end? Well, the only unpredictable thing about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts doing it with the vampire, which, incidentally, is not as hot considering that it occurs for about three seconds, in which you is closer to "what the heck?" then "Dude, this is hot." If it appears in reruns, God forbid, DO NOT ASSIST.
