This movie is really horrible, the sweet eye that plays Ben can only compensate for everything that is wrong with this movie. The writer / director / producer / main actor etc probably had a good idea of ​​creating a film that deals with the important issues of gay marriage, family acceptance, religion, homophobia, hate crimes and whatever another issue that strikes a gay of these times, but try to include each issue in such a poorly designed film little justice to any of these causes. <br /> <br /> The script is poor, the cast is very common, but the dialogue and acting are sad. The homo-hating brother is played by the greatest actor in the field and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors (I think I've seen more passion in a commercial corn flakes). The acting is tough, and forced dialogue (a scene where the brother is feeding the detective with his lines was the highlight). <br /> <br /> I am very happy to see that the creator of this train crash did not push any other junk for distribution, and if he is thinking about doing this, I have some advice - just do not do it.
