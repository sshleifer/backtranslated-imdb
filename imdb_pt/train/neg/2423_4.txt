I got this movie from a private collector and I was very curious about that. He had a 7.8 in IMDb (9 votes only) and some external comments were enjoyable. But I must say that it is a very common and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never scared me. It starts well, but although I'm not bored, the story is so common and the things that happen are so normal that I did not like it very much. <br /> <br /> You can laugh a little. . And you can see some little tits. But if you like the kind of giallos I like (bizarre, surreal, absurd, bloody, atmospheric, brutal murders ...) you will not like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> I give a 4 for good direction and editing, and the latest twists, which make the movie fun. But it could be so much better.
