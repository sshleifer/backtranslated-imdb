The screenplay for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins had to introduce himself as a theater student in order to bring some life to his dead script persona. I do not know if that was the director's purpose, but Hopkins' Cyan did not emerge beyond vanity, fear, and lack of self-esteem. The real Cyan might have been all this, but then, why make a movie about it? Mussolini was a little more convincing, and his long road was closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was simply ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the impotent script), while she had to be the central character of this supposed family drama. Watch only if you like Venezuelan novel.
