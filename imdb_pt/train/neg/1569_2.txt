Weak plot, improbable car malfunction, and clumsy helpless characters. At first I thought that this film was made during the seventies, since the quality of the image as well as the plot and the drama seemed taken from an old episode of Kojac. When I checked and found out it was actually done until -97, I was amazed. This is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you read this, be warned, if you see you wasting time when you could have done something more exciting, like watching paint dry.
