I'm not usually motivated to write comments. But this movie was so painfully painful that I feel I should. I cringed at the astonishingly predictable plot, giggling and laughing at times that should be tense. In fact, most of the audience seemed very bored and chatty even in the "tense" moment of the film. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. Even the "twist" in the end was not. I heard that the film did not take itself seriously; but I could find little evidence of this in the movie. <br /> <br /> The cut should have been left on the cutting room floor. Do yourself a favor and spend your time and money on something else!
