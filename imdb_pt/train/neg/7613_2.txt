The small Californian town of Diablo is plagued by mysterious deaths after sheriff Robert Lopez discovers an old box. According to Lendend, the box contains the sixteenth-century Mexican demon named Azar. FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murders and join forces with the sheriff's daughters, Dominique and Mary, fight with evil and bloodthirsty demons. "The Legend of Diablo" is absolute rubbish. The film is not afraid and blood, the acting is amateur and the direction is bad. The animation is the only aspect I am a big fan of indie horror movies, for example I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" is a huge Definitely one to avoid.
