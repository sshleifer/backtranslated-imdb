I honestly want the last 30 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br /> The only person who is prepared to watch this movie is Helen Keller. I kept saying to myself that this has to improve, that has to get better. Then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint in their eyes. <br /> <br /> They spoke like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> One drove a car. <br /> <br /> A Voodoo woman asked what one of the "zombies" wanted and the "zombie" said (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> (FOI) left the movie that I can not take anymore Can I sue for Â½ hour of my life ?????
