Jamie Foxx is fun, but this movie was made before. The villain plays a "Malkovichian" character from "In the Line of Fire". The cops will do anything to find the thug - and of course the good guy has two types of thugs and a couple of cops behind him - all the time he's just trying to turn a new leaf ...
