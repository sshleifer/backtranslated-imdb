If you want to make a movie like that, the threat will be real. Do not surround your patsy with a bunch of Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is monotonous and unbelievable. The acting is even worse. I thought I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood), who is one of the worst actors in history when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point he has to face the music and get struggling with anger. I dont care. You? There are all these long scenes in this austere office (the furniture made of cardboard or Masonite). People talk and smoke and they do nothing. Most of the action happens in a five-minute sequence. After that, it's over. Do not bother yourself.
