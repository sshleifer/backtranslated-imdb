Ooof! This one was stinky. Do not fall somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller, that's for sure. In all reality, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! video and Captain EO, but not with such a big budget, and much more closes of ugly teenagers crying. Simon Le Bon fills front and center while the rest of the band tries to hide the fact that they stole the entire career of the last 3 albums of Roxy Music. Barbarella's short clips do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the role when they played 'Hungry Like The Wolf', but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience turning into a woman painted with tiger stripes? I mean, they are not singing 'Eye of the Tiger 'or' Hungry like the Tiger 'is a Wolf! Anyway.) A DVD of Duran Duran's 80's videos is probably worth looking at for the love of nostalgia
