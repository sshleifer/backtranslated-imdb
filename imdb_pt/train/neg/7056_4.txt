This movie is a great example of how even some funny jokes can go awry. I actually expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add that was funny as hell, but the movie was not even good. <br /> <br /> The strange part is that the jokes are really funny, the parodies of the smoking ban, Jo Bole ... etc. are genuinely good jokes, but I do not know who to blame this movie for. <br /> <br /> The main candidates can be: - 1) The hammers (actors) and hammeresses (actresses) and not even the funny type 2) The director 3) The guy who launches the actors and / or the director Anyway, if you are really really bored and I mean really watch this movie or else get a copy and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh at your butt because those will be a lot funnier than the movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only saving grace of this movie is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
