I was created by watching the original Batman Animated Series, and am an avid collector of Batman graphic books. With a comic book hero as iconic as Batman, there are certain characteristics that can not be changed. Creative freedoms are all good and good, but when you completely change the character, it's very far. I bought one of the seasons of "The Batman" in the hope that an extra bonus could shed some light on the creators' reasoning to make this show an atrocity. In an interview about the production of "The Batman", one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure which) said "We felt we should not mess with Batman, but we could mess with the villains." So they went on to make the Joker into an immature child begging for attention, the Penguin on some imitation anime, Mr. Freeze on a super-powerful jewelry thief, Poison Ivy on a teenage hippie, and countless other shameful acts that are doing Bob Kane rolled into his grave. <br /> <br /> To sum it all up: I wish I had more hands to be able to give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN. It tightens my rating by a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the Batman name. Warner Bros ... rethink this! Please!
