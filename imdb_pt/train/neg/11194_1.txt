The upcoming attractions of "The Order" make it look like a decent horror / horror mystery, but what we have is a plot that has the potential to be excellent, all thrown together to form a pile of crap. <br /> <br /> First of all, the whole movie is a terrible dialogue with horrible special effects. The acting was also nothing to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled it correctly) saved the film in this category. <br /> <br /> For the love of God: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
