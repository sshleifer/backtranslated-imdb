Four young best friends chauvinistic macho pigs (with an emphasis on pigs) meet weekly at a New York restaurant to report their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator dating to the three bachelors of the group that leads to conflict and to the inevitable "whipping." Although the premise of the film has potential and there are some funny moments, the film does not work especially at the end, where the girls are made to look better than the guys, which runs counter to the core of the story. One of these bands of a man with only a dozen producers, "Whipped" is likely to be appreciated only by the kind of young men who think "The Man Show" is Emmy stuff.
