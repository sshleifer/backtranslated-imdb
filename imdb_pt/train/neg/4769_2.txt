Unfortunately it was misdirected. This movie stank from beginning to end. It was hard to watch because I used to watch Clarissa Explains It All every day on Nickelodeon. I loved you. Then the next thing I found she did a spread on Maxim and she was beautiful! I did not really hear anything about her until I watched this movie by accident. I could not believe she would let something like that be seen with her name on top. Everything was wrong, but it still seemed like someone somewhere on the team was really trying very hard to save a sunken ship. What a shame .. I hope she continues to act and I would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie.
