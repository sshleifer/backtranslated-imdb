STRANGER THAN FICTION irritated me so much, I signed up for IMDb just to write this comment. STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex film, touching and thought-provoking to the end. Once you suspend several lapses of logic (why Will Ferrell did not hear Emma Thompson's voice 10 years ago when she started writing her book? "The phone rang." The phone rang again. "How could she not know if he is calling?), the film challenges the thoughts about mortality, destiny and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should especially entertain former English majors. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, although Will Ferrell can easily be an ax-slayer like a fumbling soul. His quick confidence in him is a great leap of faith. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the end. By the end, I would have given 9 out of 10 stars for this movie. The film as a metaphor for the journey of life as a tribute to the notion of "writing with truth" as a reminder that great literature is comedy or tragedy, but not both, is remarkable. The entire film leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell's fate. And no matter how loving a character may have become, we know very well why we will accept the ending. The last act occurs, the screen turns white, the credits roll. A deep and powerful ending to an almost perfect movie. An end that would have been debated for weeks. <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!! No credit rolled. Say it is not so. Let's just say Hollywood did not stick to another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie. Dustin Hoffman was right when he said, "It's not a masterpiece anymore, that's fine." A proper review of the film. Except for me, it was not quite right. I was so offended by the betrayal of "real writing" about the decision to please the film that I really burst into tears of rage explaining it on the trip home from the movie. I do not usually cry. I could care less about most movies, but I'm still mad at this. <br /> <br /> My questions to Zack Helm, the writer, are: did the original movie end when the screen turned white? And have you been forced by the insipid powers of the movie to adhere to an unfaithful ending to the core of the movie? Or did you adhere to this sentimental ending in yourself? I read that you are brilliant. I hope your original screenplay has finished the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know that Zack Helm will never see this criticism, and I could not find a contact for him to ask. But, please filmgoers, am I the only one who feels this way about STRANGER THAN FICTION? One good thing came from me watching this movie: I doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION now.
