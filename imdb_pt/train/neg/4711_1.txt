I really hate this show! I watched an episode and knew that this show is really terrible. The story lines are poorly written and executed and the jokes are really bad ... I mean, it's just a copy of Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, about an obnoxious boy with blond hair and inflamed with his twin brother. twin sisters and talking dog; a father who stays at home and a smart and super busy mother ... Like oh-my-flippin'-God! Their father is a crazy mother-maker, he's not that gay! If my father is a homeowner, I would personally die! Shame it is ... I really would. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more about it ... this farce, but only 3 words; count them 3 words to describe it: · Lame, · Stupid and above all ... · F ** K UP! That's all I could say personally, it's definitely making my list of the worst animated series EV-ER! If I had one that is.
