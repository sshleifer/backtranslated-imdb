Seriously, the only good thing about this year's ceremony were the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was short, it was still a bit boring. I think it's serious the moment to look for a new director and producers for the show, which can come up with something REALLY new. It is quite obvious that they have tried to make the show more "modern" and appealing to a younger audience this year, letting Beyonce introduce herself and letting P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Also letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to re-new the ceremony and make it more appealing. None of this worked. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a funny guy, but he was not really a good presenter. I really only saw him as a guy who only spoke from time to time between the different categories. His presence was not as 'big' as Billy Crystal's. <br /> <br /> Also the prize giving was pretty dumb sometimes. Not letting everyone take the stage, but also handing out some of the prizes in the middle of the theater was simply weird. <br /> <br /> Even so, I can not remember being more satisfied with the prize winners. None of the movies actually swept the awards as the last couple of years has always been the case. So does that mean it was a good year for movies with many competitive competitors? I think not. I think most of the films will be largely forgotten in 20 years, except for "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of the Christ", perhaps. Of course I do not agree with all the awards that were awarded this year, for example, Caleb Deschanel should have won for best photography, not that I did not enjoy the work of Robert Richardson, he really did an incredible job for most of Oliver Stone . work, but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the award more. I would also like to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell winners for best editing and John Debney for best music. But okay, there's no way the Oscar can please everyone, of course, I understand that. There will always be people complaining about the winners. It was also funny to see that most of the award presenters were much more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did the prince say any of the named names immediately? And was it Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they have lost" Irons were the best presenters of the night. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very forgettable show, but with good winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
