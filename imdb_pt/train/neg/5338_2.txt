Elvis Presley plays a Native American "mestizo" ("Indian") who has to defend his reserve of unpleasant business tycoons. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight and make kids. Struggling, struggling, and "beating" each other replace the hand-stereotyped expression "How"? <br /> <br /> Although he has makeup, it is obvious that Elvis is healthier than he appeared in previous films. ; possibly, he was preparing for his famous "return". It could not be because the script for this movie was something to get excited about. Joan Blondell trying to seduce Elvis, and Burgess Meredith in "war paint" should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is Elvis's love song for the bull "Dominic." There are some surreal scenes, but you never become a crew enough to succeed in that genre; however, "Stay Away, Joe" can give you some laughter if you're in the "right" mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
