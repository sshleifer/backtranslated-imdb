The film has the longest, tortured and agonizing end of any movie I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, it starts shortly after the opening credits. January Jones gives a presentation of wood, I was surprised that she did not catch fire when she got close to the candles in the movie. I really do not remember her from the other films she did (a blessing that I have to believe in. I never criticize the acting of an actor because in the movie there are many things that can affect him, but in this case it's so bad that in truth stands out from the ATROCIOUS screenplay. Granted she is given lines and situations Meryl Streep would have problems but I swear she is sometimes reading from a signage card outside the set. Few times I thought she may actually be learning disabled or I'm sorry for the other actors, I'm sorry for the other actors, I'm sorry for the drama, the dialogue and the rhythm are as bad as you can see, but there are still no excuses for this performance, or for the director who is perpetrated. club pushed into a rotten burrito and then regurgitated by a high school writing director, and take back what has Studio's executive crayola over.
