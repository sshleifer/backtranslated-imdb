Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (as Carl Kolchak) is back; this time, he is behind "The Night Strangler". Again, police and fellow journalists do not believe, or want to cover up, the supernatural angle. Director-producer Dan Curtis presents the same basic story from his previous "night", with an understandably smaller success. <br /> <br /> Curtis assembles a fun support cast, including students from Dark Shadows, George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) tops a sexy collection of belly dancers. And although I've never seen this mentioned anywhere, this should be Roger Davis as McGavin's dining companion in an early scene, feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires!
