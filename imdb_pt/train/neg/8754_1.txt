This movie is really awful. After seeing the ad, I thought it might have its charms ... but no. Girls can not act and can not sing either. The soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs, and it's not a beautiful sight, a terrible plot, an unbelievable plot, it's one of the worst Disney movies by far! Ally is not a bad actress in "Phil of the Future", so I do not know what happened in "Cow Belles". And her sister, AJ, seems to be just hitchhiking on her sisters' fame, and she does not show any talent like never before. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls finally learn a little clich√©. moral, but this is late to rescue this wreck train movie. <br /> <br /> Horrible
