One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it begins to be satire, is that it is plausible. I would have thought that an anti-matter bomb would do a lot more damage than intended. But I'll leave it to the physicists who might have seen the Solar Crisis. <br /> <br /> It is a crisis that the Earth is facing because the solar explosions are getting totally out of control. They are coming close to Earth, so much so that it is becoming exceptionally hot, as if the entire Earth were the Death Valley. The answer is an anti-matter bomb that a spacecraft will have to take to the sun and blow it up there. This will divert the flames in the direction of, say, Mercury, as long as it is not in direct alignment with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who to deliver, but Captain Tim Matheson and his team. That is, if he can keep his mind on business at hand and not on the fugitive son, Corin Nemec. Caring for the personal side of family problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and Nemec's grandfather. <br /> <br /> Here too is a villain, Peter Boyle, who is the CEO of a multinational corporation that in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors. The idea that he may not survive does not enter into his thinking. He's doing his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. The solar crisis looks like a bad mix of 2001, A Space Odyssey and Journey to the Bottom of the Sea. Boyle seems to be following Gene Hackman's example as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently he's the only one on cast that realizes that he is in a turkey and surpasses properly. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strong, true blue and bland. Except possibly the desert mouse Jack Palance who finds Nemec and takes care of him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the film was directed by that famous Hollywood film producer, Allen Smithee. The film gets up to four stars for the cast involved and left in time for a Thanksgiving sculpture.
