This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the film. The jokes in the film are cheesy and although the plot is interesting in some angles, it is very unlikely and, at some points, ridiculous. If you are 11 or older you will ignore the writing in the movie and you will be disappointed but if you are 10 or younger this is a movie that will capture your attention and be amazed at all the stunts (which I could add are poorly made ) and wish you were some warrior for. The cast of this movie was not very good, and the song was very disappointing because it was as if they were trying to increase the tension but it did not fit. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, being 1 horrible) the performance in this film is 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this type of film, in some of the most serious scenes, her performance was laughable. When she did some of her "fight" poses, I started to laugh out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the direction, for example, the part where her enemy is the person the evil villain is possessing, as her voice becomes dark and evil, I think that's incredibly stupid, and how Wendy's teachers (Brenda's Song) were all her teachers at school being owned by monks, this was pretty ridiculous for. So to sumamrize everything, a disappointing movie, but that's okay if you're 10 years old or younger.
