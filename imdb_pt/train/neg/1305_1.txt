"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related pre-sequel are in "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are cool hip 1980 classic horror." I am very confused about the writer's "Demons III: The Ogre" (Lambert Bava and Dardan Sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid than the bored ghost of William Shakespeare or spider web demon egg or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream.) very, very, very, very annoying movie I bought The special DVD box called "Demons" in the 3 different movies called "Demons III: The Ogre" , "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons" does not have subtitles and subtitles priced at $ 14.99 from the Best Buy store in Downey City Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are low quality writers who make the film stupid almost like " Halloween III "does not have Michael Myer but people use Halloween.I'm really confused.I really love" The Demons "and" The Demons 2 are better the boring stupid "D emons III: The Ogre" is not part of "The Demons" and "The Demons 2" are the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
