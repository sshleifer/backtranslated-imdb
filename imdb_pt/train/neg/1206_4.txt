This long-lost movie thought sometimes comes available on the web. So I bought a copy. Well, of course the acting is terrible and the plot is childish, but it has its moments. I think the people who researched this one also know the past. It was made by a grindhouse movie owner for an extremely low budget. But for me he certainly did not spoil the money in props, but in makeup. Makeup is for this kind of movie well done. Zombies are watchable and blood is intact. The only problem with this kind of film is the quality of the film. It is horrible, luckily, not to whistle the sound, but sometimes it is very dark. So you have to watch clearly to see the blood. In a funny way, they tried to sell this as not to the most sensitive. A broadcaster says at the beginning of the film that he is looking for a signal and a man who appears with green flashes, which indicates that there is a hemorrhage in the way. Of course this does not work, it made me think of Cannibal Girls, it had that annoying boredom when the red stuff started flowing. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Do not go to the plot, go to the zombies and notice a continuity error. When the girl and the guy are making love first she gets her bra, then they make love and suddenly the panties are back ... try to do this, or I'm getting a little out of line, ... eat their bodies ugly
