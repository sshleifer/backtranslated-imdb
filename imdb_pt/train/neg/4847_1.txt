As usual, I'm doing a crazy race to see the movies I have not watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be in my alley. I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz you got. There is no story !! A group of boys stroll through Iraq. One day they are here spreading a bomb. Tomorrow they are working around the field, alone and start firing. Do not wait here they are back in Baghdad. There is no cohesive history at all. The three main characters are so characterized that they are mere caricatures. By that I mean, we have the sweet kid who's afraid to die. We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safely. And then there's the reckless cowboy who does not follow the rules, but has a crush on the little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldier DVDs. What do you think will happen ??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who does not follow the rules is going to make the sweet kid get hurt with his renegade ways? Because yes! Do you think the Iraqi boy that the cowboy soldier has a crush on him will be killed and make him go crazy? Because yes! There is no story here. The script is youthful and predictable! The camera is too hectic to look "artistic." And for all of you who think it's a great war photo, they'll rent "Full Metal Jacket," "Deerhunter," or "Platoon." Do not waste time or money on this boring movie!
