There are movies like "Plan 9" that are so bad that they have a charm about them, there are some like "Waterworld" that have the same unexplained draw of a car accident, and there are some like "Desperate Life" you hate to admit you love. Cowgirls do not have any of these rescues. The ensemble cast has enough talent to make almost any watchable plot, and from what I've been told, the book is enjoyable. <br /> <br /> How then could this movie be so unbearably bad? For starters, it looks like the director has assembled a cast of names with no other draw than what the twenties will bring. Then tell them to do the best imitations of Kevin Costner. Open the book randomly and start filming what's on the page, making sure you keep the big extensions of America interesting in any way. Finally, give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the refrigerator just fired him. He has twenty years of experience in court. <br /> <br /> This movie now sets the basement for me. It's so bad that it's not good to be bad.
