Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico Border Cop. He serves as a paternal figure for young immigrant Danny De La Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants Savalas to be the godfather of his impending marriage. Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) can be tougher. Difficult is what you need to stop smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Alliances may be in flux. <br /> <br /> If you think the possibility of hearing "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" uttering profanity be repulsive, you should avoid the "frontier". If not, you may not have stomach for the "realistic" scene of cow slaughter. Although not worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
