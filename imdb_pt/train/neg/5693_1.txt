I can not believe the positive comments in this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, most poorly performed and misunderstood movies I have ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp?). Does she start hanging out with him while he's tied to the chair? puh-lease. The worst part was that it was not bad in a good and laughable way. Simply terrible - I could not figure out why they bothered to show it on HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously silly - very unbelievable as an eccentric "eccentric". Idk, I could continue - again, I'm shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that kept me watching is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the end did not disappoint in its foolishness either! "Live by the sword, die by the sword ..." ridiculous.
