Okay, how is this original? That means rich old man leaves his property to his adult children, all of them ungrateful losers, and two scary servants, as long as they spend the week in their old scary house. What happens that night will surprise only those who have not seen a movie or television show before. After a series of murders in which the victims seem to be bleeding restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious twisting end. The cast is led by once respectable actors who must be desperate for their paychecks. There are also some second-tier actors who were coming up at the time, but long forgotten. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of "Matlock". I'll give credit where it's due, the final scene is clever and fun if you're still awake.
