The film remains in gray for a long time. Very little is explained as the film progresses, resulting in many weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning, but because of storytelling they become just strange and not understandable to watch. It kind of forces you to watch the movie again, but no way am I going to do it. It's because I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure that if I watched this movie at night, I would have fallen asleep. For me, the movie was like a poor man's "Blade Runner." <br /> <br /> The film leaves many questions and improbabilities. This makes the film leave a senseless and non-lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Also the strange appearance of the film does not help much. The film is split in half in CGI / half of real life, but is not half as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative, as would be the case in later films like "Sin City" and "300". They created up to half the characters in the movie on the computer, which seemed like a very senseless and strange choice, considering also that the animation of the character is not very impressive. Of course the futuristic environment is still beautiful and the film obviously was not cheap to do, but its style is more substantial and in that case, this is not something really positive to say. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting. The main god of the movie constantly says lines like; "I'll do it, but it's none of your business because I want to do it." Just do not say anything Mr. Horus! It's annoying and a very easy thing to put on film if you do not mind explaining anything about the plot. Also the deeper issues and meanings of the film are confused with the script of the film and its script. <br /> <br /> The actors still did their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were sure that what they were doing would be something special. So I can not say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> The story and the film are far from original. It is a rip-off of many classic and semi-classic science fiction films, mostly modern. Maybe it's also the reason the film made a very redundant impression on me. <br /> <br /> A flawed and uninteresting movie experiment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
