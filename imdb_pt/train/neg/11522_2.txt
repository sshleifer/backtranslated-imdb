First, the title character is not even the main character of the movie. He is the helper of the cult leader. The actor who plays Igor believed that screaming loudly, laughing hysterically and having a crooked smile while bothering his eyes would be a great way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of shouting (because in fact he never spoke) with a shrill voice. He would also say "idiot one-liners." For example, when the cult leader kills one of his followers with a circular saw, Igor, upon seeing it, shouts, "Paul, no, Paul, why did you do that? In another scene, Igor tells a victim that she would have to "get her own tools for surgery, because now it was time for him to operate." In addition to the bad acting, the ending did not make sense because as the story builds up the little steam that has toward the climax, which is Igor making a beastly arrow in the head and the rest of his lunatic friends being killed, he appears again two more times to kill the remaining "good" ones. The film offers no explanation for this, just telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the psychiatric hospital. What??? Bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie. I wish I could make up for the moments I missed by watching it.
