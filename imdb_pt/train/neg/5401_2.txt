It would have considerably strengthened considerably making it like a 50-minute episode of the Outer Limits. Much superfluous material and things like the evil boss who seemed to have escaped from The Phantom of the Opera did not help. The whole sequence of 'Night of the Living Dead' was extremely silly and completely unnecessary. After all, if the dead were to punish someone for their sins, now do they remind me exactly who was killing everyone again?
