I've been a fan since his first album. This movie is a disservice to him. The performances, with the exception of one by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, are simply terrible. Those by Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker were particularly annoying. Even that of the McGarrigle sisters was ruined by the so-called harmony of Martha Wainwright. <br /> <br /> I've never seen my wife get up and leave the room in a movie before and I've seen myself fast routing through the performances to reach the few segments of the interview that were also hard to watch due to poor work the camera. <br /> <br /> There are many who were able to play the songs of Mr. Cohen, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson come to mind, but the people selected for this performance were just horrible . <br /> <br /> I hope there is another attempt to capture Leonard Cohen in the film that illustrates his vision, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad
