It was supposed to be Freddy's last movie (and it was for over 10 years) - you would think they would have tried to make a good movie. But they ended up giving us the worst of the series (and that's a lot). The plot made no sense (I seriously do not remember that), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them dead) and Freddy's jokes were even worse than normal. The only good thing about it was a brief (and funny) Johnny Depp appearance (the first "Nightmare" movie was the first). <br /> <br /> I also saw him originally in a theater where the last section (reacting to Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well - the 3-D was lousy - colors faded and the image coming in and out of focus. Also the three flying skulls that should have been scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. Everyone started to laugh. It looks even worse on 2-D TV. No sense and stupid - very dull too. Skip this one and see "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
