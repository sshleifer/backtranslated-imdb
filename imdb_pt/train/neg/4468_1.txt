OK, clear and simple, if you're a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP AWAY FROM LEGEND. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly the most disappointing TR game yet. Looks pretty good, looks pretty good, but it's totally impossible to play and I gave up. I feel like I was stolen by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games, the controls were standard. In ODA they were "tacky," but still the same general control sequences. In Legend they have changed their methods of movement and control completely and it is totally uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> I've seen comments in other places from people who say 'Use the mouse'. No, why should I? Others say "Use a gamepad". No, why should I? Others say "But this has been the standard for third person controls for years" Well, I do not care, it's not the standard for any other TR game so why mess with it. Oh, I know, because they could not care less about their original and loyal fan base, they want to make money with the new kids who have not even heard of the series until the movies came out and made a lot more money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice to any serious TR fan is to keep away from this game, and if you buy it, complain to Eidos. I have seen masses of other posts, especially in the Eidos forums, from people saying they are rubbish, maybe listen.
