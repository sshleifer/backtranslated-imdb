I never watch this movie ... it's the biggest pile of things I've ever seen in my life. and that's saying something. the acting, the plot and the filming were absolutely terrible, this is THE WORST FILM IN THE WORLD !!! seriously, is not even a success, since it cost 99p of sainsburys and was only made in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera on the corner of the screen .... although if you really want to watch it you have to watch the "scary shark scene" ... possibly the best piece of acting I saw in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours EVER!
