I vaguely remember Ben from the days of science fiction fandom of the 60s, was doing various interviews and biographies of obscure actors, notably Ben, actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair, who played Angela in The Young Savages of 1961 Ben was one of the people in a discrete Sci-Fi con in Chicago around 1970 when I had a good conversation with him and his "career" and life. All of this was published in some long-forgotten fanzine of the day. I would like copies of these interviews, but the time goes on, and any of these people would certainly not remember me so many years later. Ben was a very nice guy, earning a living (The cons of those days did not even pay their guests unless, of course, they were big stars, and even then the payout was a few hundred dollars at most! Know that Ben is still alive and kicking How about a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Ugly then, uglier now!
