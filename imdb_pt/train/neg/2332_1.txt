What was the purpose of this film? I suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a great pay for doing nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep my interest in this boring movie. An ex-boxer braindead falls with a strange woman and her relatives. He begins as a man fixing up for the woman and ends up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme. It was so confusing that I can not even write a decent review. If you see this, my sweet, make sure it is after dark so you can go straight to sleep.
