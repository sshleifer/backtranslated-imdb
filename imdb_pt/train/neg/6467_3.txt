I still can not believe this movie. They have so many unbelievable things that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to do it. <br /> <br /> The story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no story. How can you mix a comedy with a train robbery, a prison movie, city conspiracies, sex jokes, and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> Beyond the terrifying direction, the most remarkable thing is the actors. I watched this movie and thought, 'Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can not be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando's true. (5 minutes later) That can not be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for all of them. (At the end). No, no, no, that can not be Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. Then it was over and I fainted with my nerves. So many good, Oscar-winning actors, usually convincing in such a stupid, stupid, horrible movie. I rarely wanted to know as much as they came to act in this. They did not get that much money. <br /> <br /> Just an unbelievable silly and idiotic movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10 \ 1/4 \ 5 (1+ - 6-)
