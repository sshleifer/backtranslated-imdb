On the surface, the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's good to see that the devil's child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed or diabolical, it is very effective. But in Omen 4, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think that she could be a diabolical child, but a troubled child. Issues that maybe only a therapist rather than a priest could help. She does not look scary or diabolical. Instead, she looks moody and moody. <br /> <br /> This movie had potential and was made by the same people who had made the previous three films that could have worked. But it really is an insult to actually make a sequel to one of the most favored horror trilogies, such as one made for special TV movies. <br /> <br /> On many levels, it descends. It's cheap, the acting is superficial and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not direct them to them. I recently re-watched it after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it has dated terrible. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of watching this, then I suggest you do not. Watch one of the others, or watch the Exorcist, or watch The Good Son. Just do not waste your time on this nonsense!
