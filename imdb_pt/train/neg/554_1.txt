This movie is horrible. The script is bad, the script is mediocre and even the sex scenes are useless. The emotion and intrigue of the original film is completely absent. This film was filmed in a dark, somber and monochromatic style (the "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. The thoughtful character of Greg Morrisey displays a facial expression throughout the film. The plot twists are missing here; the few that exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is the performance of Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequence, but not enough to compensate for other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a "Wild Instinct 3" should be done would be if Michael Douglas agreed to join the cast.
