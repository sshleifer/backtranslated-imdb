This film is not only a very bad movie, with terrible actors - or presumed actors -, a bored direction and an unattractive story, it also copies exactly one scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso" directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 two years before), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and a cult movie around the world. In "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director repeats the scene of the bed between the black girl and the white girl, with a pio-tone watching from a bedroom window. Of course, the scene in Rizzo's film is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charm of Martino's film. To put another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tone reviewing the scene is simply the most appropriate way to prove that Rizzo's film has no ideas, has no originality, no taste, and absolutely nothing. I think these things are an offense to the viewer.
