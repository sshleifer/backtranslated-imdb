In a way this is the disaster that Fellini has worked on throughout his life. The line between the absurd masterpiece and the rubbish of free association is very small, and in what category a movie will finally fit will depend only on personal feelings. That said, "Casanova" left me in cold admiration for his sets and little more that can not be more conveniently summed up by Bukowski: "Casanova also died, just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no courage , to say that he lived well is true, to say that I could spit in his grave without feeling it is also true. Ladies usually go for the biggest idiot they can find, that's why the human race is where it happens today : we have created the intelligent and enduring Casanovas, all hollow inside, like the Easter bunnies we adopt in our poor children. "As far as I can tell, this is the position Fellini takes about your subject; <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment is made up of decadence and incestuous behavior, themes that Fellini more clearly addresses in "Satyricon." The succession of the plot is characteristic of soft porn, only without the coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and viscous to the point of distraction. <br /> <br /> However, it may just be a point in portraying Casanova as an ugly idiot. And I challenge anyone to formulate this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever, he looks here like a dirty old man - a master, of course, but one whose impulses satisfy more than any other. I find it hard to imagine an audience that likes this movie. It was a story that was not worth telling.
