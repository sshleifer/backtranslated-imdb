Small, ridiculous-looking boogers that generate foam and reproduce. So far, for the horror elements that this movie has. The rest of MUNCHIES plays like a very retarded comedy that is so stupid you will not find it funny after 15 minutes. I can imagine little children cheering for these little boogers, but adults will be left with only those supposedly "smart" references translating to things on screen like Captain Kirk's STAR TREK log entries, the ET's best-known scene, a blatant statement from filmmakers "Look! We are profiting from the success of GREMLINS here!" and a cardboard clipping from Clint Eastwood telling us ... and about his western movies exactly? The latter was totally lost on me ... Ah, yes, and the disposal of chemical waste in caves seems to be a bad thing. I do not know where they got the idea from. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that MUNCHIES is the most unbearable movie to sit on, for that matter. It's really, really dumb. And if you can smile while watching, you'll probably feel so dumb for doing it after the movie is over. Good evil? Yes, but only if "dumb", "retarded" and "ridiculous" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
