As far as the film is concerned, it's an OK science fiction movie. There's a lot of cool stuff and some quality footage. That being said, it's not so good, and some of the things are pretty unlikely ... <br /> <br /> As for calling this another movie-cube, it's total and complete. This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie ... The whole meaning for this may be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube itself it's a bit of an excerpt ... <br /> <br /> I gave this 3 *** because of the original backstabbing. This should have been kept barren in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all ... Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube but is not recommended for fans from the series ...
