Yes, this movie is a real thief. He stole some brilliant Oscar from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war hero movie to increase acceptance (support?) For the wars that the US are still struggling today. I really do not want to get into politics here, but come on, this is clearer than the summer sky. Hurt locker is nothing extraordinary, no real plot. I feel even in the 50's of Hungary, when the party told people what they liked and did not like. The same propaganda films were produced at that time, with the exception of black-and-white films. Even if we consider this title a reasonable part of the genre "the US wars are cool," you will certainly have far better films to choose from.
