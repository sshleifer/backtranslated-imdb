I'm fed up and tired of all those little weenies about how this movie "rocked". It's pure CRAP exaggerated! Do not send a Murderer, it's much wiser to smuggle hundreds of venomous, colorful and aggressive snakes into an Airplane! The only reason people like this movie is because they feel they need it. It's not "so bad that it's good" It's so bad that I'd rather be nudged in the eye with a sharp stick, then be subjected to it again. I honestly thought it was going to be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE! A parody! I was wrong. It's all "It sucks, you know!" Or Samuel A. Jackson screams "Snakes on the Plane thing!" Well, I'm sorry, I did not get it.It seems like a lot of the weak gave the film industry more money to make more films like Triple X and Die Hard.If you spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought the William Hung CD, still live in the basement of their mothers, and smell the plastic chair sweat of days on the computer playing online games and looking at pornography, then Run to the To hell with movies like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. There is no irony. to watch good films.The true decline of Western civilization Calling it a cult film is an Insult to the true classics of the Cult, like Repoman, or even Orgazmo.I have said enough here.
