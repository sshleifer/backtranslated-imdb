I just watched it because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured with Claudio Cassinelli, an actor that I like. I certainly was disappointed. The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to death for TV ratings was exaggerated with Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner, and the new movie, Death Race, which will surely suck. me in because star Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> This was just a hole for the most part. The action "Kill Bike" was ridiculous. The "training" was a festive nap. He just never got me and made me want to care about anyone, including "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others mentioned and you will get better.
