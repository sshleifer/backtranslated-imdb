This was one of the most anti-nuke films of the 1980s. The idea that a child and a basketball star could "change the world" is quite unlikely given " "and" celebrity protests "that existed and are. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament, because some apparatchik children became aware of a "silent protest" the West is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> What ended the Cold War? America hard, I dare say "Reaganesque" and the internal failures of socialism. It was not peace marches, die-ins or movies like "Amazing Grace & Chuck," "Miracle Mile," or "Testament."
