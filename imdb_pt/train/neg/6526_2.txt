Ineffective and inept film, in which the characters meet in rooms or a rocket and talk without stopping. You may think that things would cheer up when you explored Mars, but these scenes are filmed through a red / orange filter that makes everything very dark. The Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are totally unconvincing. There are echoes of "Monster Bride" when the heroine carefully tosses octopus like a tentacle of a carnivorous plant around her before debating faintly, the difference being that Ed Wood's movie is a hundred times more fun. Better to wear ear plugs while watching the 'sci-fi' music score, repeated indefinitely, will drive you crazy. If you can not sleep one night, just put it on the VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time.
