A group of us watched this movie were really angry. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character, Jo, was not (it's not as if the writers / producers could do anything about it). The writing was poor, the script was below average. What REALLY bothered us: 1. When the two guys realized they were both dating Natalie, they not only let them stand up to this stupid (and ultimately demeaning) competition - but only because they were competing guys, not because they really wanted Natalie . 2. Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the meeting, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no prediction that he was actually a better guy, it's as if the writers tossed a coin and then spit it out at some convenient point in the movie). 3. Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children, and all of a sudden, when her husband says she wants to have children, she agrees.
