TV productions in the early 2000s were between weak and poor. Before such brands as Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk the TV still did not have the right hit, which could capture the attention and interests of the viewer of the 2000s. Titles like Relic Hunter, X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging for you to watch and follow, or at least not be as captivating and interesting as the weather that preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact, it's Men in Black finds spoof of X Files! (As if these were special unit 1). But even in accordance with this brilliant formula; did not work well. It was promising; at the time, there was a certain saturation of "supernatural" cases after a decade of many X-files, so the natural spirit of satirizing it as well (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). However (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this, or a strong one when it comes to making a comic-book science fiction show. It was highly ridiculous, where, for example, every sexy situation should turn into something ugly and ugly. I liked that sickly bad taste. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic and almost unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was all languid. Of course the show was funny, but overall it was a bland job. Of course, there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among other works (Evan Katz) as co-writer and co-producer as (Seven Days) before or (24) after, this should be a low! Despite his distinctive personality, he managed to be a silly joke most of the time. So if this was goal there then they made one of the most silly even! And truly, it would be one of the rarest moments to be grateful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it!
