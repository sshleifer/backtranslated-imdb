I have nothing to comment on this movie It is so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb site to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting instead of watching this movie ... anything serves , even looking at the walls is better. <br /> <br /> And because I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I say it's also a low-budget movie, bad acting, no name actors, a silly wolf mutt, and so on The film is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". The film is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So, have fun! ;) (not watching this movie)
