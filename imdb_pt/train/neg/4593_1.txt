As a physics student, I became aware of many idiot teachers and other experts in the field. As I continue with my studies, I learn more and more about actual physics experiments, and about the people who are doing the right things. <br /> <br /> So my friends tell me about this "physics movie" they want to see. Not knowing anything of this, I am excited, hoping that the information is well presented. <br /> <br /> I did REAL quantum mechanics; that was not it. <br /> <br /> This movie begins with the basic assumption that anything that occurs on a subatomic particle can and will occur if you simply open your eyes. Let's think about it, just for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are made up of something around 10 ^ 30 of these subatomic particles. That's a billion billion billion particles! The more "mysterious" quantum effects of only two particles can have a 50% chance of completely canceling out. As you add more and more particles to the mixture, it becomes almost impossible to have a great quantum result. To tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption, with no rationality behind it ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, also in physics, and I counted 3 facts during the course of this film. . But they were presented in the most misguided way I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can not say the same for the neural part of the movie, since I did not have any kind of medical training. It looked like I might have had a bit more truth in that, remembering my days in biology, but I can not say. <br /> <br /> At least this movie had a redeeming quality: the dancing peptides (or they really were) scene. Not to spoil the invaluable plot that directs this movie, but the main character goes to a wedding, where she sees all the different types of personalities "boosted" by their peptides *, and then the movie cuts to the dance floor where we are divided between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and a totally CG scene, full of dancing peptides. The movie, at that moment, was trying to tell us how we are "emotion addicted," so we are led to the full song of that great hit, Addicted to Love. <br /> <br /> This scene was redemptive, because anyone who could go through that scene, and still take that movie seriously ... well, you have to "open your eyes".
