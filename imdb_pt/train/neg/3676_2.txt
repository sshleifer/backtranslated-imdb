Susan Swift is an attractive young woman, a flower child transplanted to the 1980s (as a young Susan Dey), but she does not have the vocal range for a dramatic demand and she tends to whine; yet she is quite sweet and has bright eyes and a handsome smile. In "The Coming," Swift may be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The film is very low budget and lends from so many other photos that I gave up on it with about 15 minutes to go. It starts strong and has some camp appeal. Obviously, there are more serious films dealing with the Salem witch trials that deserve to be seen on this one; however, like garbage films, it's not too terrible. The venues in Boston are a definite plus, and the supportive cast is fun. * 1/2 of ****
