This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not express how bad it is. I honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to end the pain. I recommend instead of watching this movie, you bathe in acid, then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD. case, and when at the beginning, added that Jesus was following them I was so excited ... so by the end I wanted to kill myself. I mean a twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in movie history ... JUST SLEEP! Monkeys could have done a better job editing this crap. At least they would have dumped feces and smudged some of the trash. It would have been better not to have seen anything of the horror. <br /> <br /> It was not that I did not understand the jokes, it was that they were not just funny, they were repeated twenty. times. Apparently, something is not funny unless you see it like a million times. <br /> <br /> Do not under any circumstances see this. People rated 'Hands of Destiny' as the worst movie in the world. I've seen this too and I agree it's bad ... but ALAS is only the second worst. 'Fatty Drives the Bus' is much worse. <br /> <br /> It deserves all kinds of harsh language, but I can not write it here, so just imagine that I swore a lot.
