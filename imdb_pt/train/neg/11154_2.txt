This move was on TV last night. I think as a time filler because sucked badly! The film is just an excuse to show off some breasts and butts at the beginning and somewhere along the way. (Not bad and butt though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The "wolf", if you can call it, is hardly shown fully save your teeth. When it is fully in sight, you can clearly see that they had some trainees working in the CGI because the wolf runs like he was running on a treadmill, and the CGI looks like it was waxed, all shiny :) /> The movie is full of blood and blood, and you can easily identify who will be killed / cut / eaten next. Even if you enjoy this type of movie, you will be disappointed, they did not do a good job. <br /> <br /> Do not tell me about the actors ... Very sweet lines and girls scream about everything every 5 seconds. But again, if someone asked me to act badly just to give me some change, then, hey, where do I sign up? <br /> <br /> Boring and laughable general horror.
