At the end of this episode, Holmes asks Watson not to file the case to posterity. For good reason! The super detective left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for that story. There is no deductive reasoning, no sharp analysis of signs at crime scenes. Holmes gets fumbled for 50 meters behind the plot. The coward CAM is finally treated by a frail old man - in a way that would have made Charles Bronson's heart swell with pride - six bullets in the barn. In a pursuit that followed a pursuer takes over one of Watson's shoes. the writer didn Decide to address the story of Cinderella to prolong the film. The murderer, Holmes and Watson, escape free. Oh, well, it's a bit of a change of pace at the end of Victorian London. A little law of the sixgun :-)
