My spouse and I found this movie very schlocky. It all started well but quickly became unbelievable and ridiculous. Most of the acting was bad, except for the little Abbie girl, who really was great. Besides, the dialogue was predictable and lame - especially Gideon the Angel. Besides, without giving anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost seems indifferent. At first we thought it was "shock," but then we realized it was just a terrible script. We love almost every Hallmark movie and its heart warming stories, but this movie does not stand up for the occasion to be one. There are so many great - do not waste your time with this horrible movie.
