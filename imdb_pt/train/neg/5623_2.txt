Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into an "Jack London" adventure film is not a bad idea; certainly, he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, ends flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (as London) has some London speeches; and it's good to see your bearded Jack get "The Call of the Wild" after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog, "Buck." Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very beautiful. The film draws unfortunate parallels between "Yellow Hazard" between London life and World War II, both tense and insulting. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
