That makes the third Errol Morris movie I've seen, and I'm increasingly disliking his style. He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries, and then, in an ironic language, make fun of everything they are. It's never a direct caricature of them and Morris seems most of the time to be saying, "But no, no, these people are really fascinating, actually!" But there are always those small, subtle angles and not-so-subtle editing. techniques that show that Morris seems to be making fun of them behind his back. <br /> <br /> This film accompanies four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man who studies hairless African molerats to discover that they are unbelievably anthill, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of shrubs in the form of animals and a robot designer. Does the overall theme of the film seem to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human, and life characteristics? So the title Fast, Cheap and Out of Control does not really seem to mean anything in terms of film ... right? Except, of course, that Morris seems only slightly disturbed by the passions of these individuals (he might call them "obsessions") by making synthetic drawings about life. I do not share this fear and honestly do not appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the movie. <br /> <br /> But I emphasize your subtlety. Without voice-over and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it is not as if Morris has ever noticed this anxiety in the collective head of the audience. Instead, he mixes circus footage and filming ants, often on occasions when they are drawn from the circus and ant context, showing a kind of collective nonsense behind what all these people are talking about. I do not think they're absurd, I think they're all very clean and interesting individuals. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, he did not intend such juxtapositions, which means that he is just a bad craftsman rather than a silence. subverser. Since none of these movies I've seen so far impressed me particularly, I do not really care to figure out what he's trying to do. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
