Here again is another film by Diane Lane, where she betrays her husband. Is that the only role she can play? This time it is set in 1969 and she betrays her husband with the man in the blouse. I'm not so surprised because this is very predictable. Then the husband gets angry and throws the milk. I would not be surprised if she slept with the milkman either. I would not be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too, because this is a very annoying movie. Then, after throwing milk, she apologizes and sees the man's blouse again. Duh. So while she is doing it to him, her son is stung by wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones at a wasp nest. This mother of children did not have time to tell her that she was too busy with the man in the blouse.
