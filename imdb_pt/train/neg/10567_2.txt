I thought this movie looked like a case study on how not to make a movie most of the time. As a filmmaker, I give him a 2 for consistency. <br /> <br /> The problems remain from beginning to end, with the plot being extremely predictable, using bits of most, if not all, of previous successful war histories. . Computer-generated graphics were much like watching a video game on points, and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what it had to work for, but I did not find this information. <br /> <br /> It seemed that this project pushed the boundaries of a low-budget film very far, resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without his imagination being involved. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
