This film, by Oscar Petersson, is unique. Its uniqueness is not in history, since the Hollywood production of many brains served us comparatively miserable portions, but rather in the complete manner in which total and absolute filth in one aspect is united with equal weakness in all other respects. /> <br /> The dialogue is worse than embarrassing. Rotten and abysmal attitude are thrown into the mix. Bosnians who speak English with strong Swedish accents add an element of unintentional humor. Uninspired lightning and camera work are frozen in the turkey movie cake. As a sort of surprise to the public, there are some completely unmotivated slow-motion sequences where you least expect it. To add insult to injury, the whole thing is cut off by someone devoid of sense of opportunity. <br /> <br /> The scene of "evil villain is good after listening to a good boy's speech" in the church, it's time to dethrone Ed Wood from the position of worst director of all time; Move over Ed Wood - here comes Oscar Petersson!
