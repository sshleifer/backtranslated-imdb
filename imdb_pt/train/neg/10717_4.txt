I give it a generous four out of ten stars, or dots or markers, or something. <br /> <br /> There were a total of two really funny scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) have advanced a lot. Otherwise, the usual traffic of stereotypes, speed of rudeness, rudely pushed by a stupid soundtrack, and "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the two really funny scenes involved Amy P. She's really hilarious in a type of animal. She's a mix of this weird man they do in SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) have just admitted that they did it for the money, because if doing that gave birth to Sarah Palin's parodies, then I think we can say, yes, it was worth putting the black guy back in the role of servant, who is actually there to help him be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 outta 10 as I said is generous. <br /> <br /> But no more, girls, okay? I almost forgot. The mother of "Two and a Half Men" is in this movie, and she did some kind of plastic surgery, so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30-year-old person, so all the scenes she's in, me I like to try to rearrange your face, or put it in my mind, or just answer the question, "No. Wait, wait, did she have plastic surgery?" Because, as a viewer, you really do not want her to have a plastic surgery.
