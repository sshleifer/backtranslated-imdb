I saw this movie in a preview at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the producers and the director of the film were present, presumably to evaluate our reaction. Many scenes evoked laughter from the audience, which would have been nice if it had been a comedy, but it was meant to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience was not scared, it looks like the filmmakers were. They delayed the release for over a year. Out of curiosity, I saw again to see if they cut it; As far as I can tell, they did not. It was the same bad movie, just a year older. <br /> <br /> It almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
