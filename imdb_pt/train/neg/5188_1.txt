TV pilots, do not you love them? Quinn Martin tried to do this after having been successful in several other TV detective films, but this is nothing but the MST, where he belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head, who takes orders from Aunt Mary to find the super spy Lovejoy, I mean Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else. Tree is a bad guy, though all his disguises make him look exactly the same as he usually does. There are more unnatural clothing fibers than you can imagine (required in the 70's) and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why did not you go to the show? You find out, it's pretty blatant. Once again it's fun for the MST, but not much else!
