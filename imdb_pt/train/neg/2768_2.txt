This movie was awful. <br /> <br /> They did not develop any of the characters and the plot was played horribly. It was a definitive sleep. You'd expect the action scenes in a movie like this to be your strengths, but D-Wars surprises yourself with a disappointment in that department. <br /> <br /> In addition, acting was just one step above the level of a low budget porn movie. And I really mean it. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the final credits because it was so bad !!! Please, whatever you do to people, do not waste your time and money on a low-quality movie like D-Wars.
