As others have bothered to summarize the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this film. There may be spoilers here; I do not care enough to filter them out. <br /> <br /> Given the low budget of the film, the creature's design was very good. It's really good to see a direct horror movie for video that is not covered with horrible CGI. Unfortunately, the quality of the digital film is quite grainy in some places, and is most noticeable in the white and well-lit halls of the asylum. <br /> <br /> - The ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this movie, not to mention the variations the passage of time. I understand the director might be trying to simulate dementia, but for this to be effective, a consistent stream of time needs to be established. As it is, it seems merely amateurish. <br /> <br /> Roots in history were numerous, but consistently predictable. I had no doubt in my mind about the identity of the cultists of robes, nor about the fact that some kind of manic-bad development would appear in the end. <br /> <br /> This may seem to be masking, but the characters in this movie can not use any kind of common sense. First, the regulatory commissions would be in a whole mental health center that unilaterally declared all deaths of patients and staff induced by cardiac arrest. Why would the chief psychiatrist also be able to perform autopsies? Why has not a plot of these impressive qualifications been made, or of its introduction to its strange choice of religion? What is the background? What should make us care about someone else? And as importantly, who in good conscience would go through the introduction of the place would see everything that was so frighteningly wrong, and then conclude that it was still a great place to look for a residence? This movie did not even respect its characters enough to give intelligence the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> In short: See The Wicker Man.
