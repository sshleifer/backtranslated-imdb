I kind of accidentally ended up watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt like I was watching the movie made by this group of film school students who did not make the cut. It reproduces every conceivable Hollywood clich√©, at the same time as we are plagued with the message "Corporations are the ultimate evil." Subtlety this movie does not know. As far as it goes, it even manages to provide its own spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be the fantasy world of a computer nerd coming true. The main character is an attractive teenager with a girlfriend, but he is still a programming genius and apparent hacker (I think) among many other nerd-fantasy-truth elements that you will have to see for yourself. Well, I should have known it would be a z movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... it tends to be a good tip. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this one, I'm afraid.
