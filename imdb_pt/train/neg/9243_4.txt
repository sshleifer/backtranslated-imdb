Put simply, I do not like westerns. And having never gone through one from beginning to end, I decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and see it through to the end, no matter how painful it was for me. At first it was unbearable as expected. I found the ridiculous acting, the scenery (its standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing fluttering on the brink of pain. However, after mentally convincing me to fight, after the first 20 minutes, it began to be a little easier for me to handle. Focusing on cinematography, and how John Ford managed to do even the duller situations (dull according to me), they sometimes seemed quite impressive, which made them much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can not go so far as to say that I liked the movie at the end of it. However, it was done well enough for me to sit to the end, and this in itself impressed me.
