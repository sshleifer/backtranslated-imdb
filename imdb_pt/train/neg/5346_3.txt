I had to watch this movie because the plot was so outrageous and the movie lived up to expectations. In fact, this makes visualization quite uncomfortable at times. Unlike other Meyer films, sexual antics are at a minimum. Some of the violence scenes are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some of the performances and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange combination of sadomasochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of slavery and failure on all fronts. . It's as if Meyer was trying to compensate for sexploitation / blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows we're a little guilty of getting excited over the blatant dominatrix connotations of the opening scene, showing Lady Susan wielding a whip in provocative clothing. He then tries to get back on the right path by turning it into a movie about the triumph of good over evil. However, because they cancel each other out, you end up with nothing. <br /> <br /> Because so bad, in so many ways, it's really worth watching if you enjoy the art of making a horrible movie at worst. I like it possible. Perhaps, for being so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the unacceptable.
