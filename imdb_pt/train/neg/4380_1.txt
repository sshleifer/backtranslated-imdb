Synopsis: A loving couple decides to get involved in some extramarital jokes in a flashy car. They then get stuck (literally) in a compromising position as the car wanders aimlessly across the field until the unlucky couple is rescued by the authorities. <br /> <br /> That's it. This is the whole movie. There may have been some dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should be obvious now that this movie is not only useless but physically painful to watch. The fact that he starred in two of the most promising actors in the UK (one of whom is now sadly deceased) only adds to the horror. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleson was prominent in the much deserved Oscar. winning 'Chariots of Fire'. Let's remember him for that role, and try to pretend that this particular celluloid abomination never happened.
