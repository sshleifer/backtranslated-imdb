Shame really - very rarely do I watch a movie and feel disappointed with the ending. I saw some of Ira Levin's adaptations - 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives' - and I liked them, but it just did not appeal to me. When I read the outline of the plot - an award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to murder one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and uses his script for his own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director and Ira Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin everything for those who have not yet seen, but all I would say are loads of twists and turns. So many it is difficult to explain the plot of the film in detail without revealing it. I liked the first ... 45 minutes, before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and pleasure began to disappear. Although I have to give Lumet credit for the very fun ending that made me laugh out loud. The main cast - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles. . Although Worth's obvious Russian accent made me nervous a bit (nothing personal, Irene, I think the false accent of any actor would irritate me). I'm not sure if Cannon's character should be annoyingly funny, but Dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone reading this - I do not want you to be left out watching this because of my views - take a chance, you may like it, you can not. It's all about opinion.
