If there was a scale below 1, you would receive a -10, following in the footsteps of Godspell. The acting (if there was such a thing) was atrocious, the plot in tatters. And Rene Russo was sickly sweet in her role, enough to make a person vomit. Ten thumbs down for a dumb movie. Saving grace: praise for the costuming era.
