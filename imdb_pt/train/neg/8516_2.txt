Last week, I took a look at Nielsen's weekly ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show you're not watching." <br /> <br /> Well, they're sure you're not watching this. It aired twice and stood at 147 and 145 in 147. Translation: This is the program with the lowest audience in any national broadcast network ... and deservedly. I tried to watch it a few times because of all the press coverage, showing it as a "great" show, a "realistic look" in life and all of these nonsense. The reality was different. Veronica Mars is a bummer. It is as unrealistic as possible, and deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only Mystery is why the CW felt obliged to put on its inaugural calendar the show of lesser audience after a two-year continuation. commercial and artistic failure.
