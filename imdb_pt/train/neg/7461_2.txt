*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Since its opening credits, this fantastic film confirms everything: it's an instant classic. It did not take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than 'Kindergarten Cop' or 'Police Academy 7'. The greatness left me speechless as I left the theater and went straight back to the bar to buy another dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that simply requires multiple views. The first observation will surely leave you with that strange "Huh?" feel, but not feel ashamed - happens to the best of us. The story is so devilishly intelligent that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors. What seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the FBI turns out to be an allegorical story that works on many levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life. The complexity of the frame structure will confuse you in your first view, but do not give up! Not until my sixth or seventh vision did I just begin to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of "Corky Roman." And beware of the unexpected turnaround in the end, otherwise you may be caught completely off guard when it is revealed that FBI agent Brick Davis is the FBI's most wanted criminal, Corky is not a real FBI agent, Roman Pops is innocent, Peter Romano admits that he is illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual. Surprised the hell out of me, I can tell you too. Chris Kattan's comedy talents are second to none as he takes his character Corky Roman through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. Recalling John Reynolds' performance in "Hands, the Hands of Fate," Kattan takes on countless personalities and tackles every scene with a perfect comic timing. However, Kattan is not just about comedy. He is also a master of drama, as he controls the public's feelings with the slightest movement of his face. His facial expressions reflect life itself, in a way. For example, in the scene in which he appears on the faces of his brothers, you can see that the expression of social injustice and alienation reflected clearly in his anguished face. At a time like this, it is difficult to find a dry eye in the house. <br /> <br /> Writers David Garret and Jason Ward are the true heroes of `Corky Romano. With a history of such proportions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project. His skillful narrative and unorthodox structure make "Pulp Fiction" look like a mediocre sketch from Saturday Night Live. The story of Garret and Ward is so compelling and seductive that you cling to your hair, swallow you completely, shake you and spit you out. At the end of the out-of-the-world experience known as 'Corky Roman' you meet a different person with different worldviews and different ideas, and with only one question in mind: <br /> <br /> God? Because?!?
