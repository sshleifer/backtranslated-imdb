Hollywood has always had difficulty accepting a "religious picture." Strange Cargo is no exception. While using the talents of a superb cast, and produced on a high budget, with properly temperamental photographs of Robert Planck, the film fails in credibility scores. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements disrupts the viewer's involvement in the action and fate of the characters. I found it difficult to be quiet through all the invented metaphors, parallels, and biblical references, and impossible to accept the presumptuous knowledge of Ian Hunter as a figure of Christ. And the censors from Boston, Detroit, and Providence at least agreed with me. The movie was banned. Few viewers from Boston / Detroit / Providence, if any, complained or traveled to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford somehow got involved in a "message image." He flopped everywhere. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the movie had a revival on TV. A homely atmosphere seems to make the film's allegory more receptive to viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this strange load flows along predictable, strongly moralistic lines that will have no one guessing how the main characters will eventually come to terms with fate.
