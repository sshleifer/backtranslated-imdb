I remember reading all the horrible and horrible reviews for this movie when it came out. I intended to see how horrible it was, but it was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to be managed is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out on DVD, I bought to see how horrible it was. I could not think of the horrible attention that this movie was receiving was possible. After you see, I can understand. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that this movie is not exempt from some cool photos. There's a nice picture at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was cool. And the way the monsters in this movie die is cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If evil acting was a sin, then hell would have played Tara Reid since she's so incredibly horrible in this movie that it's unthinkable. And of all roles, she plays a healer. Now, if she plays an idiotic, headless sexual toy, maybe I can forgive her for the way she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll did not notice this, although she seemed to think that if she took her shirt off in the film, people would see her. He simply did not realize that getting her to do it in the middle of the movie at the wrong time made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is this a Mexican song or something during the dry sex scene? I could not say. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst driving skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I would give House of the Dead an F (and I only do this for very few movies), but HotD would get at least a B compared to that piece of spoiled junk. The film begins with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and is read by a horrible narrator), and from there, the cuts are very, very stupid. There is a point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that has been destroyed and the screen darkens. When he returns, Slater and Reid are firing everywhere, and suddenly an entire army joined them. There is? <br /> <br /> And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes of this movie. At one point, a team breaks the glass, but the glass breaks before it touches it. Tara Reid's earrings change colors in the middle of a scene and after Slater walks away from a dead companion, you can watch her begin to rise. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I was really lost. Something about an ancient tribe liberating the darkness and someone "opens the way" or something and all the evil monsters come out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gunshots (the technology is so advanced here that no character needs reloading in this movie) that are simply boring. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I did not laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
