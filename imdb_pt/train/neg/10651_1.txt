Want to know the secret to making a horror movie at a fitness center? Just put the movie out with gorgeous girls in super-tight gym clothes and make them beat and grind the floor like they were at a gentlemen's club. That's what the creators of this horrible horror movie did and that little trick kept me watching until the bitter end. This is the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but every time I was ready to switch channels, they added another scene with the training girls and I kept quiet. Like a horror movie, Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase for beautiful girls working out, it is a success. Strong recommendations to avoid, unless the thought of half the film being a great T & A show is appealing to you.
