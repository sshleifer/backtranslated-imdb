We were served - a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit that since I'm white and had no practical experience in the "competitive world of step-dancing," I could not exactly be an authority on this type of film. On the other hand, I know a bad movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> And, man, I just saw. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Low Budget Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid ("A Touch of Rose"), "How She Move" tells how important it is to follow a person's dreams - even if those dreams include loud and irritating hip-hop music and speaking dialogue, the average person would not understand if he or she had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I'll try to give you a little synopsis of the plot. First of all, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J, who work in an automobile store in Toronto (the Mecca of racial diversity) but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are a few other guys on this "team", including a symbolic white guy and a guy who looks like Denzel Washington on "Malcolm X". There are also two women in the film - one resembles Serena Williams and the other looks Geraldine from the old "Flip Wilson Show." One of these women was expelled from a private college because her parents spent all their tuition with a drug-addicted brother. The other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, no doubt simply is not good. <br /> <br /> There's another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat while he's still another actor who's an asshole from Huggy Bear. These guys are rival step dancers. Of course, this activity is very tough in the neighborhood, and they are all practicing for the big congestion "Step Monster" in Detroit. Since I was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue (perhaps some legends have been useful, such as in a Bergman movie or that Snow video clip), it is difficult to explain what happens, in addition to A lot of discussion, the girl Serena Williams (who never smiles, by the way) becomes a freelancer (passing from one group to another), there is a bit of step dancing and a lot of annoying hip-hop music. <br /> <br /> It's a typical rag story for wealth; kind of like "Rocky" with a very bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without the laughter. But why a movie - which could have had a major impact on the black public - has to contain drug addiction, bad parents and a title that sounds like a first-grader saying, "Like her movements "? <br /> <br /> I was "moved" by this movie, though. He moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible.
