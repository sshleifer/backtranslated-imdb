The film was a big disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such dark patterns. Poor script (almost non-existent) and sequences of songs with bad songs every minute and at the strangest moments they would kill any humor that the movie could offer. some of the scenes were funny, but they were only 5 minutes long. The issue was pathetic. Discouragement! In general, the film disappointed, since the lack of history was too evident. In fact, only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the break. <br /> <br /> Nobody would miss you if you did not watch the movie. It is not worth spending valuable money to join this movie. wait until it appears on TV ...
