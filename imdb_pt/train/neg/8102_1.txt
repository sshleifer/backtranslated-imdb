Oh, I heard very well about this movie. I went to see him with my best friend (she is female, I am male). Now, please, allow me a divergent view of the mainstream. After the first two dozen "took off their clothes," we both felt a very strange combination of folly and boredom. We laughed (for this, not with this), we dozed (and would have been better off staying in bed), we were convinced that we had spent money in vain. And we did. The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care. A waste of money, a waste of celluloid. This movie does not even deserve one in ten votes, but it's the smallest available. I do not know why this movie has a reputation for being excellent; I would not recommend it to anyone who has a taste or intelligence.
