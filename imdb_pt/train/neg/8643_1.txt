A Blair Witch-War movie that is as disappointing as Bwitch! The title says it all, save your money and your time and spend on a good movie like "Once Upon a Time in America", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to watch a GREAT "war" movie ) <br /> <br /> This movie, if it was a baseball team and the major leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the beginners, so this movie was high school. It was filmed as if it were a high school theater club filming with his father's old camera. Of course they went into a hostile area (to make a movie), but I do not call it mad, this is why we call it stupid! This is a pass all the way! Now go watch and then you tell me what you think.
