When I come in the forum of IMDb, I'm always fed up when I see a post "the worst movie of all time". After watching this movie, I think I'll soon create my own post! <br /> <br /> The opening titles: great, some sort of lame zoom in a gas oven (yes, focus on the fire = explosions = great action packed movie !!) <br /> <br /> The actors: I think Ice T is a cool rapper, even a good actor (sometimes I insist, "sometimes"), but cop Steven as a cop he plays is ... beyond words. The rest of the cast is ... well, I do not know where these actors were hired, but dammit! I bet my dog ​​would have been a far better actor than them! <br /> <br /> The plot: Hijacking.original is not it? <br /> <br /> The action sequences: The first scene of the movie is a blast. I said to myself, well, cool !! At least there will be some good pyrotechnics .. I was completely wrong. The rest of the film is full of low air force takedowns ... <br /> <br /> The dialogues are hilarious, the music is sheer crap, the ending is happy (I mean I was happy in the end because the movie <br /> <br /> My cousin who was watching the movie was delighted (I'm 22, she's 42 ... well). was about to take the film and burn it. Maybe next time I'll go watch it ... (who ever said ???)
