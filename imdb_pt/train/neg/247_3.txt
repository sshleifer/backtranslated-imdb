It was 9:30 pm last night in my friend's trailer and we were so excited to watch South Park (a new episode). The thing is, in my country, South Park airs at 10:30 a.m. and we decided to kill time by watching the upcoming show, Father of the Pride. I'll start by saying that I only watched episodes. The first time I saw him, I found him dumb and rude for nothing, so I thought, "Holy, I have a football game tomorrow morning, so I have to stop watching stupid drawings." But yesterday, I tried to give the Pride Parent a second chance. I think it's a complete robbery of The Simpsons, just replacing yellow human characters with lions. <br /> <br /> The second thing is that I wonder why he won the TV-14 rating. I find the Simpsons much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in this program is some homosexual jokes (bland). The Simpsons are also much more violent (Halloween specials) and raw. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, well, I have news for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he got very much into the family theme. However, I must admit that the Pride Parent made me smile (even giggle once) three or four times. <br /> <br /> All right, I do not care about the Father of Pride. I do not hate it, but I do not like it either. I saw a lot better of "The Simpsons". 3.5 / 10
