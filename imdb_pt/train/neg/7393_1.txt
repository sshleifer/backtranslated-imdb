I'm a big fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, I probably weigh as much as him, although I do not have credibility on the street to wear the beaded ponytail. Having declared my own prejudice and affection for the burly stage and favorite screen hero of America, it is with a heavy heart that I must declare that this is his worst film of all time. I'm not sure if it could make a movie worse than that. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the biggest problems with this film seem to occur in post-production. It is painfully obvious that this movie should have a different storyline. This results in lamentable voices in which Steve's voice almost does not synchronize with that of the dubbed voice. The issue is pisspoor and overall this starts badly, gets even worse, and in the end you'll wish you had rewatched The Da Vinci Code. Yeah, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> After that, I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me for listening to their CDs. Is it time for me to start checking some of the Van Damme straight for DVD walnut records? If you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyes out and throw them in the toilet. A lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of it.
