This film has a weak plot, a weak characterization and really weak special effects that I question because I lost a valuable life watching it. There are random characters who add nothing to the story and look like an apology to the director getting his girlfriend in the movie. The robots are sad and the main "hero" bot is connected by a huge knife switch. If this movie were not so bad, it would be laughable, but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters, and he is dead. It's sad when you cheer on the bad guy, because he's the best to cheer. When all is said and done, it is best to leave this film on the cutting room floor, or never funded.
