I just watched this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez at SWAT. But this is not SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some nice characters and made sense. The bullfighter had none of it. <br /> <br /> I should have realized that it could not be any good, after all, the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes played a starring role. <br /> <br /> A poster here called an incoherent movie. Another called the worst movie ever. Both gave much credit to the film. I'm so glad I picked it up from the library for free, but I still feel cheated. The IMDb must include a "0" in the vote "vote for this movie", only for movies like this 1.
