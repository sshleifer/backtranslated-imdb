I honestly have to say that I could not stop watching this movie from the beginning. Simply how bad it was !!! It's like watching paint dry just so much more confusing. I mean, you sit there and just expect something to happen, anything actually, preferably something that makes the whole movie make sense! At the end of the movie, I actually stood there wondering if there was any chance of missing the first hour that explained everything or if I inadvertently fainted during the movie and lost the parts that stuck the plot (if there was one) together! The main thing that really puzzled me about this movie, it's almost at the end the main girl (if there was actually a main girl) was in some kind of alternate reality, I mean what the hell was going on at this time ?! she suddenly woke up and was in a mental institute, chained to a bed being drugged by doctors or something, so faster than it would have taken me to cut my wrists, she turned back and she was being eaten by some random vampire That it did not make any sense! I'm tempted to send emails to manufacturers and demand my time back, I mean, I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this crap! I'm kind of interested to know if the filmmakers themselves really knew what it was about! It looked like someone had edited all the pieces that could have made sense, although I think the movie would have to have been 4 hours long to make it happen! I completely side with the other person who wrote the other comment, I was rudely fooled by this movie by its title, and that's it. I'm so grateful I did not buy the movie, no matter how many times I saw it at the local store. You would have thought it would have given me a clue that the movie was a complete pile of fumes of smoking movies, but to be honest I think $ 1 was a lot of money to spend on this movie !!!! What a great waste of time and a good razor blade, I mean I wish OD'ed, it's less painful than watching this movie !!!!
