Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested in seeing what he would do with full creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, it's undeniable, though not because the jokes are not funny - some (I do not say most) of them are, and indeed Mr. Mike did a good job translating his mentally imbalanced speech into visual jokes. The problem is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, his name) is so horrible that the film is intolerable. A clothing called "PKO Productions" receives the production credit, but it does not seem to be produced; it looks like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and did the whole thing one afternoon. I realize that Mike's goal was to torture the public, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to see, hear, or understand all that is shocking. Still, the DVD is not a total waste: it includes a compliment to O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three "Mr. Also, the "cat swimming" section of the movie is a great scene to be caught watching if you want to scare someone. 3/10
