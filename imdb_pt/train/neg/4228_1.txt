I can not believe how bad this piece of crap is! I want my $ 3.99 back! Words defy the description of this piece of bad crap! The dubbing in no form or form aligns with the actor's mouth. The film seems to have been filmed with a vintage camcorder from the '70s. I've been filming better movies with my cell phone camera. The blood is laughable because of the unbelievable plot. The acting is what you would expect if you called all your friends on a Saturday afternoon and started getting completely ripped, and then tried to put a piece in your garage. Do not get me wrong ... I was not expecting O'Neil and I love Zumbi movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this movie that they make it unattainable. Avoid!
