Here's how you do it: Believe in God and repent for your sins. So things should change the next day. <br /> <br /> Until the last fifteen minutes, this movie just plays like a bad summary of a drunk's shit life. Your mother dies. Your stepmother is a b_tch. Your father dies. He drinks. He gets married. Does he have sons. He drinks a little more. Your wife is angry. He disappoints his children. The wife threatens to leave. He calls a reverend late night b / c he wants to kill himself. So, after the recap occurs, that's when we get the subtle message "Left Behind." <br /> <br /> "He needed a salary." That's the phrase I had to repeat several times when the credits started rolling, so I would not lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen falls to his knees and begs for Christ's forgiveness. Once he does, he comes out and really says he sees the world in a different way. He tells his wife that he has found God and that is good enough for her. Flip scene four months and wife is tired of going to church. Finish the movie while Madsen walks through the bar and gives a sigh of relief over how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. Final moment He gives a small nod of disdain to the bar (ie, house of sin) and takes a special leap of gay, post-school and Miami-Vice congratulations in the air, like frozen cameras. See why I had to repeat the sentence? "He needed a salary." <br /> <br /> Man, this movie is bad. The production values ​​of the B-Grade 80 do not help much. The script could easily have been an episode of "Touched By An Angel". It could have been eliminated in 30 minutes, in addition to commercials. The acting is made of wood and is never believable. Even Madsen, of whom I'm a big fan and the only reason I went through this, makes it clear that this is his first job as an actor and that he does not know his a $$ from his elbow still on camera. 45 minutes I started to get discouraged. This thing was like homework. I just wanted to put it aside and say okay, I saw half of it. That's good enough. But not. If I sat through the Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit through it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not giving a thing to 1 is by two points: 1) I love Madsen. I know it's not fair. But it's great to see the opening title "Introducing Michael Madsen." Sue me 2) Some of the Dialogues are so bad that they are classics. I'll put some quotes at the end so you can enjoy them too. <br /> <br /> That's about it. To finish, this thing sucks to blush with the rest of the Turds. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, DAUGHTER OF MY CHIEF, etc). Now I have to rewatch Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a police officer to have my respect back through him. See you later, Kids. <br /> <br /> "This thing will blind me, but I'll drink it anyway" - Madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I do not" I do not understand! Everything looks so beautiful! "- Madsen leaving home after confessing to God <br /> <br />" I go to the center later and get a bible and I'll cut my hair too "- Madsen after converting to the dinner table because Satan live in your hair
