What a disappointment! This began with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. Admittedly, it moved at the speed of a snail, but I was still clutching it and kept watching. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey is always good value and he Suranne Jones were good leads. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were plagued with possible terrorist connections. <br /> <br /> But then Morrissey's character was killed and all the air left the balloon. The last episode was monotonous, monotonous, monotonous. The whole thing turned out to be a very small beer and the outcome was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for this? My advice: watch the paint dry.
