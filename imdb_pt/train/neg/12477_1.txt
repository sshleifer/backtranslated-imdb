This is one of those movies that you and a group of friends sit down drinking beer, eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately for me I saw myself watching this alone. My friends and I rented a large block of movies and never got to see this. It was due and I realized it was a waste not to watch it. So I did, and I was amazed at how utterly terrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> Now, I love bad movies a bit, and I probably would have liked it if the "hero" was not so totally disgusting. The whole movie I was hoping he'd put that stupid sword and let somebody kill him! He does very few heroic things in the movie. He's a fat, disgusting, stupid thing. He has less redeeming qualities than villains. And what was with all the naked puppies? I mean, I love naked girls as much as the next kid, but this movie was a little overdone in that department. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and can bear a "disgusting hero" then I'm sure you'll like this kind of movie.
