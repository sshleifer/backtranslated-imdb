This movie has to be one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD !!! The plot could have been clicked if the film had more funding and writers who would cut the senseless and sickly scenes that I carefully advise the parents ... But the plot is like a loose cannon. If there was something like driving through a filmmaker - this would have come out of it. It reminded me a lot of the quick movies that were released in the 1960s, bad screenplay and screenplay. <br /> <br /> The only sensible characters in the whole movie were the bartender and the beaver. The rest of the movie could easily have been done by high school kids. I give this movie a rating of 1 as it is really horrible and I left my whole family with a feeling of being cheated. My advice - do not watch !!!
