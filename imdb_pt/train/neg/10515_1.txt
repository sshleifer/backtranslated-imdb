Well, this is a typical "straight to the bathroom" horror movie. <br /> <br /> To shorten the story, a bunch of teenagers / young adults are stranded amid scary woods and being assaulted by naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the basics for this sloher fromage: <br /> <br /> Bare women, children or young adults being abandoned somewhere scary, death scenes, Survivor being a young well built that will always show your navel, but never bra less, a crazy and scary man who knows about evil, scene of lesbian kisses, sex being a murderer, without plot <br /> <br /> Even so, for a movie slasher, was really terrible. The atmosphere is totally dead. Nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested. Watching it seemed like he was being watched with a headache or an unpleasant cold in the head. <br /> <br /> Give the demonic ... 0/10.
