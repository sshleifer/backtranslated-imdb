Many days after seeing Conceive Ada, I'm still amazed that any group of people would spend so much time making such a heinous movie. <br /> <br /> No one should see this movie in the hope of learning anything of consequence. about Ada Lovelock, his colleagues or the product of his endeavors. <br /> <br /> Similarly, no one should see this movie in the hope of being entertained. Like a science fiction movie, this would unquestionably be a horrible failure. Somehow, the main character manages to bring the past to life and interact with him on his personal computer - with Timothy Leary's encouraging words and advice. I doubt that anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to prevent it from appearing absolutely absurd. Like a drama movie, it would undoubtedly be a horrendous failure. Somehow, the writer / director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with a constant, unnecessary, boring and trivial drama about practically nothing. I doubt anyone would feel that the whole drama of the movie serves only as an annoying distraction. <br /> <br /> I find it difficult to fully express my degree of contempt for Conceiving Ada. The circumstances in which I saw forbade me to leave the theater, but there is no doubt that I would have otherwise. I'm still angry that I lost the time it took to see this. Only I could criticize this film more effectively, I wish I were more articulate.
