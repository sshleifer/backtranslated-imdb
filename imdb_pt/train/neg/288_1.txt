There was nothing of value in the original film, this was even worse. The fact that I even met to rent was absolutely incredible. Anyone connected to this movie has to be up for something! So what was the plot? What was with the girl? Should the viewer have the story in the first four minutes of the movie? Unfortunately, I tried several times to watch this. I even lent a child to someone to get some feedback. Kid said he was stupid and he was four. I think some credit could go to the film director, since possibly some of the scenes made the film more than a B movie. That may be forcing this. I loved the theme song. Luckily it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you might like the movie if you were tall as the cast and crew would have to be. Is the pot legal in France?
