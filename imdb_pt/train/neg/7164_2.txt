This movie is more misleading than ever, using a suspenseful actor like Walken to play this piece of crap made it seem like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this! And the fact that the movie should be about a witch and you do not really see it until almost the end of the movie, but in the meantime you have to sit and watch this boring movie while it tries, or try to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through all this trail of boring actors and actresses thinking all the time how you went from another movie and decided on this and how you just waist your money just makes the whole point of useless time sitting there. I'd rather watch cartoons for God's sake. Leave it alone, please!
