I absolutely love the 'Toxic Avenger' series, but that poor offer by the Troma staff made no sense, and that made me yawn all the time. <br /> <br /> A leaking nuclear power plant (and the growing marijuana beside it) makes Tromaville High's youth crazy, which makes them join a gang, have sex, explode, and everything else . There's also some kind of high school monster creation ... God, this movie is a mess. <br /> <br /> The actors pretty much stopped their efforts after that and should. The (over-intended) overacting started to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... Disappointing. 2/10
