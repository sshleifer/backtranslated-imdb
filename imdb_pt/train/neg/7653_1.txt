First of all, I'd like to say that if I had to honestly evaluate this film from 1 to 10, I'd give it a -4. It's not that I'm a hard critic, it's just that this movie is so bad. Everything from the story to the direction, the editing is horrible. The story is not at all decent to begin with (you can not expect too much since it's based on a video game, something I was not aware of getting into the movie), but the direction and editing made it even worse. The movie cuts into clumsy spots and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to previous ones; some like a fast sex scene in the middle, nor do they make sense being put into the story, since the characters do not show any feeling towards the other. You could get into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you would still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money, and if you do not pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and do not watch.
