Race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast until you have driven 150, and 150 mph seems fast until you have driven 250. <br /> <br /> OK. <br /> <br /> The Andalusian dog seems to be breathtaking until you have seen Eraserhead, and Eraserhead looks incredibly bizarre until you have seen Begotten. <br /> <br /> And Begotten looks incredibly bizarre until you have seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Fans of racing, there is NOTHING in the entire world of cinema like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. <br /> <br /> The Alabama Ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot, and involves only hippies, rock shows, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations , elephants and mysterious gas. And the Fabulous Woodmobile, crossing the Sunset District in San Francisco, of course. <br /> <br /> What's really amazing is that someone gave you a lot of money to make the Alabama Ghost. There are sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, many and many effects. Somehow this makes the Ghost of Alabama SO WRONG. You watch a horrible cheese ball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least part of the strangeness is excusable based on the fact that they were obviously taking the movie from the headroom on their Discover cards. But the Alabama Ghost was done with a real budget, and that's EVIL. I mean, I got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the Twizzlers forest, and no one's knocking on my door beckoning with a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for FOUR the weirdest movies ever made?
