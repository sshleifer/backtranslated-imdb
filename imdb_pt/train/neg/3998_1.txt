Can you say "Every shock, no plot?" There were so many unexplored directions in this movie. There was no story about the room beyond the killings. * WHY * was wrong? What did you do that way? Why a "time" countdown? Then there were the unexplored things suggested; for example, we * saw * a camera in the vent, which he mentioned. But when he came up said ventilation, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> How about the fact that all the ghosts looked "Digital", and things "blinked" before hitting the floor making a static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all these things together, it makes room 1408 look like a high-tech home. Except there was no follow-up. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... electronics do not work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the cell phone has no signal, but the wireless Internet works well. How many incontinuities can you add? I'm sorry, but this movie was nothing more than "shock after shock." Everything was done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things just off the site. Changing paintings. Bloody walls. "Oh, it was all just a dream ... no, it was not." And, if the room was "bad," why would our main character come to terms with the death of his daughter if they were to keep him stuck there forever? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, there was no information on "The First Book" he wrote. Just some vague information about the "father was an idiot" and so on. Speaking of parents, what happened to your father? "You will be in my place." <br /> <br /> Overall, a truly HORRIBLE movie. It was 100% adrenaline shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly no background story, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My overall impression is that the whole movie was made in the "Cheap"; practically using a set and a few rental photos, and it was just a film of effects of recycled and extravagant effects, seen-before.
