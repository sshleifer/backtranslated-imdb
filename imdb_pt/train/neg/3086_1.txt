I once thought "The Stoned Age" was the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed in every way I could imagine and some I could not. In "The Stoned Age" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated the actors ... and everyone else involved in the creation of this atrocity. I will not include a teaser in this movie, I'm not that cruel. I could not subject innocent people like you to such torment. In fact, any discussion of the plot relating to this film is meaningless and humiliating. Words that I would use to describe this film are as follows: insipid, asinine and naive. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, PLEASE do not watch this movie. I beg you, from movie lover to another ... no, from one human being to another, PLEASE. Because of your own sanity and intellect, DO NOT LOOK AT IT. Destroy all the copies you find.
