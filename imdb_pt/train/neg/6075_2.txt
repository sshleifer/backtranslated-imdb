One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a useless clich√© of an exercise in horror movies. He tries to turn or distort the genre with absurd plots of a mad fan who has become psychotic - the film snakes into nothingness. Should we believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access and kills a baseball player in a fancy hotel with no witnesses, security or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to pull the strings of our heart through the commotion of baseball, ending mockingly unsophisticated and enigmatic. I'm not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got involved in this razzie. This is as bad as they come. Stay away if you prefer to think about your movies
