Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels to a madhouse to write about a new technique they use with their patients. However, the journalist soon discovers that things are not what they appear to be, and asylum is being administered by patients, and doctors are in cages. First of all, some parts of the movie are just boring and just make you want to sleep, and interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (a guy who thinks he's a chicken, for example). I have to admit that the story is really very good, but the movie itself strikes. The music in the movie is really weird and like something you hear in some crazy comedy, and yes, there's a scene involving chicken men dancing, which pretty much made me want to turn off the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated: R for Violence and Nudity.
