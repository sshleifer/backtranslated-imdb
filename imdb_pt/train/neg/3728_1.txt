As some other reviews have shown, this movie may scare you when you're a kid. (And that's probably all for what's good). <br /> <br /> However, if you are older, this movie only does one thing: suck a lot - and so I do not want to say that acting, its soundtrack, cut or s.th. Like that. I'm simply talking about the "plot" (if you can call it that). SPOILERS ahead ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I do not want to give any more spoilers of the (if after reading this, you really still want to watch this movie), but if you graduated from any school, that's just a great insult to your intelligence. Watching this, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was simply SO stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> - the formation of UNITE (an evil UN-association) <br /> <br /> -> we should only believe that it is evil. Is it really bad at all? if so: why is it evil? <br /> <br /> -the evil mark in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> - there's no need to impose this on people, so why the hell (no pun intended) are they doing it? <br /> <br /> To invite Christ into your heart just as a service of the mouth <br /> <br /> because there is nothing that someone, who in this film is considered "a true Christian, never do, besides saying that stupid prayer. so ... just say that prayer before the rapture and you're saved - no matter what? <br /> <br /> So, evaluating 1/10
