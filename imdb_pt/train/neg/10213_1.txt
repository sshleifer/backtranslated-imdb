Many people seemed to have liked the movie, so I feel a little bad by giving it a bad review. But after spending 96 minutes of it, I feel like I have to do it. Where the hell is the plot in this movie?! I must have lost, I was waiting for the story to unfold and nothing happened. Of course the ending was "a bit shocking", but they did not create it. I forgot who it was who half the time, so they really did not develop the characters. The acting was like this, most of the time it was believable, but I was able to see through it most of the time. So ... without revealing anything, I must say that unless you like the actors in the movie, there's no real reason to watch this movie. I might be wrong, but I just did not understand why there was so little or too much of the movie. I can not decide which one it would be, so I say judge for themselves. I do not know if renting it would be a good idea, the cost and everything ... <br /> <br /> Land: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Representation: 2/10 Total: 3/10 I feel it is very loud, I'm getting my vote at the top.
