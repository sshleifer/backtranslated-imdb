A discouraged attempt to bring Elvis Presley into modern days, but despite a little sexy bath scene and a subplot of the pseudo-Playboy magazine, Presley is surrounded by the same old, modest cliches. A woman chooses E.P. on the beach and then goes on to take over life - and he does not seem to mind! Dick Sargent is exhausting on another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Try hard as the two bosses of Elvis (he is working in the light of day). Some of the songs are very good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want to see an Elvis comedy more loose, modern and updated - look elsewhere. When Elvis and his Fatal Attraction enter the bed together, there is a wooden board between them! Be real. ** in ****
