Still a sucker for Pyun's aesthetic sense, I liked this movie, although the "unfinished" ending was a disappointment. As usual, Pyun develops a distorted sense of humor and Kathy Long's fights are extremely impressive. Beautifully photographed, this has the feeling that it was made for the big screen.
