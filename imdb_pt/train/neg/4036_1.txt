Almost from the word go this movie is poor and unconvinced, but again, most people would struggle to show compromise with a script as uninspiring as this. The dialogue does not really flow and sometimes as in this case more is less (or should have been). This is also supported by strange scenes (for example, Cemetry's slow-motion walk) that you think might take you somewhere, but it just seems to waste a few more seconds of your life. The plot is a strange gangster / comedy situation combination that I'm sure seemed like a good idea at the time, but if there ever was a case for someone who needs to be honest with the screenwriter then here he was. <br /> <br /> Martin Freeman is fine but then he seems to have a character that always plays, so I'm starting to wonder if he got a script or just filmed it and said to react normally. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. It reminds me of Python's quote (I think) about Shakespeare, of his "comedies" - if he wanted to say it was funny, he would have made a joke. Well, I did not see one. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - I did because I was watching with a friend and I kept hoping it would get better. <br /> <br /> It was not.
