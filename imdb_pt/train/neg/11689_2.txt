I've never seen any previous Spike Lee films, since their trailers never interested me. I have seen and admired the work of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster and I have several DVDs of them. I was, however, totally disappointed with this movie. If this film is an indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to "get a job" and stop wasting time and talent from others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie I saw. I can only suppose, from your loving comments, that your worship of Spike Lee blinded them to the banality of this work. I only paid $ 2.50 at a "Second Run" theater, and still felt like I had wasted my money. <br /> <br /> The "Trivia" page of the IMDb says everything ....... <br /> <br /> * "Filmed in 39 days" - How can you expect to film a big budget? "Blockbuster "(as promised by the media hype) in such a short time? No wonder there was such a weak performance. <br /> <br /> "Ron Howard was the first to direct the film ..." - He may have done this project somehow, given more time to do then of course. Although the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. I'm so sorry! This film was so full of pitiful cliches, implausible scenes and bad characterizations that perhaps it could not have done much of that. (Hey Ron! Be sure to thank Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks." - And that showed! Her portrait of a "Fixer," which causes people's problems to disappear, was as unbelievable as the script she received. Does she still want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other nonsense: How many bank robbers would bother to get to the door, and inform a uniformed police officer that they were in there? robbing the bank, and he better stay away ... or so? When Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) walks into the bank to check for corpses, how many bank robbers without a gun would have "led" a police officer (much less "leave" a policeman back to the front door, letting the cop walk behind him? * Det. Later Frazier said he gave the thief "every reason to shoot me" And then, in his brief struggle, he did not even try to expose the face of the thief. "That may have gotten the answer he was looking for ... a thief would have shot him just to avoid further identification. "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (the thief's accomplice), so much time to come and help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not your typical bank robbers. They did not want anyone to be harmed, but the police had no reason to think they would not. Why, then, when two of the bad guys went out to "get the pizzas?" They were not slaughtered. (First, how many thieves would have left without using a hostage as a shield? Is Spike Lee's version of NY City or SNL?). Knocking them down would have reduced the numbers of thugs, spoiled their plans and the other thieves would probably give up. If not, at least there would be less thugs in there. (Give SWAT something to do, or send them home!) <br /> <br /> * What police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White, (Jodie Foster), to go directly into the bank, and discuss a subject with the thieves, which she would not reveal first to them? She had neither authority nor governmental credentials; and besides, after all, "already" is a hostage situation ... add one more? <br /> <br /> * Why did the CEO of the Bank, (Christopher Plummer), not destroy the incriminating documents? Long time? Screw the sentimentality! The diamonds he could have sold. Who was that "idiot" (the character, not the actor), with the Jersey accent, who conveniently offered, and said he knew about the recording. was "100% Albanian," but even so he could not speak ... SIR! LOWER YOUR HAND! And your ex-wife! What a "schlump" she was !!! Both were totally unbelievable. <br /> <br /> * When interrogating suspects, why Det. Frazier, continually harassing the individuals who obviously were not part of the assault?, (Ie, telling the old woman she could go, and then she could not, then she could, so could not she?) Give me a break! Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages use jump suites, could not deduce that their escape plan included leaving the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? Near the end of the film, a fake wall was shown to have been built in the supply room, behind which Clive Owens hid for "a week" ... where did the materials come from? in? (the drywall and nails). It was also to be assumed that they cut the sewage so it could relieve itself. Did not the bank employees complain about the smell all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such a debacle; since the documents "had" fallen into the hands of the thief, what kind of "references" was Mrs. White expecting to get from the bank's CEO, seeing that he would now be blackmailed because of his failure? <br /> <br /> * And last, but certainly not least, what about the "Electric Glide" that Denzel did? HOW STUPID! Should that indicate their "determination" to bring these guys to justice? He looked, yes, like a man who took a ride in a shopping cart while trying to avoid a bowel movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Beyond the mediocre plot; lousy script; poor performance; and generally unfortunate direction ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> I hope this provides enough information about the film to help others decide whether they want to waste their money or not! <br /> <br />.
