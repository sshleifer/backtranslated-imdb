I've never found Charley Chase very funny, even though your character on the screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I find VERY funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Broon from Scotland's Sunday Post comic book page.) In Chase's best films, I usually admire his professionalism rather than laugh at him. I credit Chase that his best films - such as "Mighty Like a Moose" and "His Wooden Wedding" - inspired a fandom that is fiercely loyal to him ... but I am sure that even the most fervent Chase fan will agree that the very precocious and very rude 'Married to the Order' is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase - anxious, clumsy, naive, naive - is a young swain hoping to woo the fair Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as his buck parent, who dismisses Chase as a "mollycoddle." Leo White, who did a more remarkable job for Chaplin in Essanay, is on hand here as a rival. <br /> <br /> There is some action involving an Ingersoll watch. I was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this one of the first examples of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a major flaw in 'Married to Order' is Rosemary Theby's cast as Rose: she should be a na√Øve serial, but Theby - chest-borne, hawk-faced - is physically wrong for the paper. Theby (wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a film actress, but was never a credible naive. Film historian William K Everson dealt with it very contemptuously in one of his movie books. <br /> I would rate 'Married to the Order' only 3 out of 10, and I am being charitable ... because I still suspect that Charley Chase has something that everyone gets but I keep losing.
