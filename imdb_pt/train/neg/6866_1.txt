This movie has so little class compared to Strangers on a Train or even, Accidental Meeting for that matter, that despite the plot similarities I would not feel good about actually comparing this to any of them. The character of Yancy Butler appeared like such an idiot idiot that I was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching. <br /> <br /> I do not like the many movies of life, but I feel compelled to watch one from time to time in the interest of promoting harmony at home. I often moan quietly, but this movie made me protest loudly, get up, walk out of the room and walk around the house muttering to myself, before returning to my favorite chair to subject myself to further torture. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
