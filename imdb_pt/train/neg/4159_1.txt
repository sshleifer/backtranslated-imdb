In this strangely indifferent apocalypse, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be very concerned about this in this Grau-Z movie that bears less resemblance to Sheridan's famous novel Le Fanu than to my lasagne mom. recipe. Bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make home calls and helpful cops still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it. The plot, and I use this term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to stay with "the general", whose daughter is missing, in a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently travels with his father and daughter. I must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast expanses of unintentional humor. The film also has enough nudity to keep a fourteen-year-old interested. Someone older, careful.
