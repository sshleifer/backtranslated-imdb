"American Nightmare" is officially tied, in my opinion, with "It's Pat!" for the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely similar to the K-Mart version of the "Friends" cast) gather in a caf√© to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It is hosted by a guy with a beard. This is the most exciting aspect of your show. Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... Oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the gang of a raft in a row just take everything turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded DJ. Unbeknownst to them, a mad serial killer / nurse is listening ... <br /> <br /> The Mad Nurse then starts torturing Ross and Rachel and ... wait, sorry again ... making your fears come to life . These fears include such stunners as "voodoo" and being depressed by old ladies with dentures. <br /> <br /> No. Really. <br /> <br /> This movie was, in a word, rotten. The Mad Nurse's killing has no motivation, there is nothing to make the viewer "jump", the end explodes, and - again - voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely no respect for your loved ones, rent "American Nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones - even a little bit - go to the local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in your freezer.
