DO NOT SEE THIS CRAZY FOR A MOVIE. I wasted time and money on it and was very impressed by it. <br /> <br /> The performance is comparable to high school plays. The script is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes after the end (which I believe I should be rewarded for achieving), I had a headache from all the screams, cries and moans of the five girls. <br /> <br /> Most violence is (rare for a movie nowadays) suggested rather than graphing, but I found the characters so annoying that I wanted to see them, and in fact every person involved in the production of this piece of paper, dies of the most horrible forms possible. <br /> <br /> I spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from your very bad 100 minutes. Do not do it.
