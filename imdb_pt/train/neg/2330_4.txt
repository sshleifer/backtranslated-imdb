I liked how this started, featuring some decent special effects, especially for a 50 year old movie. There were some pretty impressive landscapes. However, the film delays quite early with a very stupid dialogue, since the males all try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius". Seeing this in the 90s after a long absence, It was fun to see Francis again, an actress who has mostly made television shows since this movie was released ... and still acting. It was also interesting to see a young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), who I would not have recognized if it were not for this voice <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie before boredom came almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I liked them re-making this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one of those overrated films where "elites" think it's so "heavy" and "thought provoking." It makes no sense. He just seemed "smart" because the rest of the 1950s science fiction movies were so stupid !! <br /> <br /> Some if the opening scenes look great on widescreen, which I did not have time for this writing. Maybe another look - this time in the 2.35: 1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review.
