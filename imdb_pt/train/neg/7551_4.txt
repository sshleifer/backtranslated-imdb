Well, I finally saw the remake last night in London, unwillingly hilarious, sexless and devoid of any real humor. I really do not know where to start, as long as I was entertained by this strange tribute, it did not really move me. The acting is crying hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are very 'Disney' there is a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after the burning of Nic Cage (which did not come soon enough for my taste) The bit with Cage in the suit of the bear, the public suppressed the joy, as well as the comedy that beat to several "villains" in the island. It's such a weird remake I can not believe I saw, it reminded me of something The Comic Strip would have done in the 80's, a bit like the Hollywood interpretation of Miner Strike, very strange!
