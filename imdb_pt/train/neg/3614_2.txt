A schizophrenic has escaped from a psychiatric hospital in New York and soon the teachers begin to be taken at St. Trinity University. The new teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to deal with the mess of the red herring. Despite a runtime of 78 minutes, this cheap slasher-drag you on and on until the lame ends where the person you suspect is the killer from the start is revealed to be as such. Director Richard Haines can barely sweat with an impromptu performance, but offers what the early 80's audience was probably craving. For all our amateur anthropologists out there, this was filmed in New Yawk in the early 80's, so you can check out the whole culture, beliefs and practices of living people from that distant place. The film gets some credit for snatching "Final Girl". You rarely see it. Also, it's always good to see a horror movie where a priest is the killer. Do not you trust the clergy, in my beloved film industry? Fortunately, this is just a fake priest and he gets caught. He is still working at the high moral angle.
