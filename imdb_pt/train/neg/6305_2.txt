This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on that too.) However, despite the fact that this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize that independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but ours. The only mediocre one is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he could not compensate all the actors (including what interpreted it when young), an act absolutely atrocious. Granted the script was terribly clich√©, but even then you have to get some decent actors! I would not recommend this to anyone because it is so poorly done in all categories. Read some books on the true story of Mason USA because they give these men the respect they deserve.
