This movie really makes you appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. It's an exquisite boredom in beautiful photos. For once, Hamilton is relatively easy on smooth focus photos. However, what I found difficult to understand about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when she was filmed, the girls are portrayed as much younger than they really are. This whole Lolita thing, especially since there's an older man involved, makes me rather uncomfortable. The heroine is actually depilated in the pubic region in order to make her appear even younger than she. Come on, sex is a good time spent between consenting adults. Another thing I found strange was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nudity scene in the movie, at least not a good one.
