If only to avoid doing this kind of movie in the future. This movie is interesting as an experiment but does not tell a convincing story. <br /> <br /> You can feel virtuous by sitting in it because it touches on so many IMPORTANT questions, but it does so without any discernible reason. The viewer leaves without new perspectives (unless one arises while the mind wanders, as it invariably happens during this senseless film). <br /> <br /> It's better to spend time looking through the window at a growing tree. <br /> <br />
