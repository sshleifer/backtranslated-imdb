The first question that comes to mind after seeing this crap is who on earth gave these idiots the right to use the name Omen in this movie? It's a humiliating, embarrassing and pathetic attempt to continue the Omen franchise. When the movie starts, the background music seems to have been taken directly from a Bugs Bunny Cartoon and from then on the movie gets worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got an E - when they took him back to show his teacher! It is difficult, after some time, to tell if this is a comedy, because what happens is so funny and so out of the true Omen that it begs for belief. The acting is laughable, especially of the protagonist Faye Grant. Is she still making faces or is she finding it hard not to laugh? It is hard to say. The worst sequel I've ever had the misfortune to witness. 1 out of 10.
