This is a simple tale, but it seems very manipulative. It has no pathos, for it leaves no room for imagination, neither for personal thought nor for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done, but I feel it is very presentational. I would have preferred more pictures behind, more space in the background and maybe this did not look so kitschy to me. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood movie works well, but it is very derivative of Aardman. movies and this is bothering me. Perhaps a longer film can test if this creator can go without the narration. <br /> <br /> I think the narration is very simplistic.
