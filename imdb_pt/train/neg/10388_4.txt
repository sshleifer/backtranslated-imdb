From reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to be very uneven, but I do not think it was that bad. I saw a lot worse, actually. "The house where evil lives" is a ghost story about a husband and wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who move to an old house in Japan. Little do they know, a Japanese ninja has brutally murdered his wife and his lover, and then killed himself a hundred years earlier with a samurai sword. As strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living and plan to reenact the bloody murder 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, the cover looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine, and it was tacky, but I saw worse in my day. The phantom sequences were a bit exaggerated, we could see the blue translucent figures appear randomly around the family, and take over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this movie reminded me of the ghosts on the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. I may be mistaken, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of that movie tore it up a bit. The old Japanese house where there was a brutal murder, ghost activity, curses placed in the house, etc. But I may be wrong. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a rather corny ghost story. Do not go out of your way to see, but if you like this kind of thing and happen to appear on TV, you can try. 4/10
