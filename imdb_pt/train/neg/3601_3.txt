Was it a harbinger when Tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (the killer) turned out to be an artificial intelligence designer? I think so. Scenes to make you squeal with pleasure: mounts galore, a striptease in a kimono (what do you call it when you wear clothes instead of taking them off?) And a climactic battle on skis! Definitely tune in to the beginning and end, but you can pick up a sandwich during the second act when the whole plot is going on. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Has Nah Tori ever come to paradise, or out of the snow, really? Do not.
