I really did not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. Typical American plot, I'm sorry. Guy gets the type of girl at the end. And London has a monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what it really is !! "I liked the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds. And the British were evil? (other than Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened to that? Oh, and they kept saying things like "Here come 'The Thunderbirds'" - but was never known as "The Thunderbirds" in the series, why this? I would like to see it redone in 20 years with more British cast. I preferred the original series. Excuse!
