This is a decent effort but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a bit in the dark about what exactly makes a cool zombie movie. No, there are software companies and CGI bugs. Actually I'm not sure if it was a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they are talking about. Anyway, my point was - instead of wasting your time animating some dumb bug, why not play more zombies and more action. 2/3 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins, bugs, some guys screaming about something. And to make matters worse (more boring), most deaths occur off-screen. I realize that this is very common for budget-less movies, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, kind-one) that left me wondering why the director (or screenwriter, anything) chose to focus on how the epidemic began - is short, no one will care anyway.
