Although there were some fun moments, I thought the movie was really bad. The longer it went, the worse it got. Once the action entered Monument Valley, I found myself watching the magnificent outcrops more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters. <br /> <br /> The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent. First she's in business, so she finds out the truth and she pays. Then she is back and then deserted again. So she's back again. There is no apparent motivation for any of his decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes and lots of lost possibilities. I would have to say that the pictures were much smaller than the sum of their parts. Apparently people who liked the Repo Man were inclined to like him. Researchers 2.0 is no match for researchers.
