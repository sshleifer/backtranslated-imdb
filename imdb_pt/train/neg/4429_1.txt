What a piece of idiotic wand. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time evaluating any of the points in this program. Not worth the time. The only comment I am going to make is - why have a doofus so disjointed, disjointed, to be the star ?! <br /> <br /> There are not many other gloomy testimonials about the deterioration of the mental conditions of the nets than the fact. which FOX has stated will not bring back John Doe (a decent series), but will bring back brain-dead drivel as Joe Millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the American public. <br /> FOX lost, IMHO.
