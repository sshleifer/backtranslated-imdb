Unknown Creature is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie. This movie sucks right from the start. It has a really stupid "plot", really pathetic "action" and "special effects". Some thirty-something "post-teens" are trapped in the jungle with a creature of crazy reptilian rubber suit stalking endlessly. What you get from this movie is a lot of talk and little action. You have girls walking through the forest talking, and then you have guys (with heavy mascara) walking through the woods talking. The whole thing is so boring! <br /> <br /> The creature itself is rarely seen for most of the film. When it is shown, the image is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a costume, hence the reason for blurring and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie in ANY time of the word and those here who praised it are probably the people who were caught on the street to "act" in this truly stupefying movie! Skip this for sure!
