Although the beginning states "All Silence on the Western Front," this silly and superficial version of the war is far removed from its much better contemporary. This portrays the most fun war ever waged, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see some battle, it is lame: an enemy plane is flying overhead? Shoot (in one shot). Sniper in the tree? Kill him before he is hit. Enemy soldiers in the forest? Do not worry, they will gladly surrender. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Thoughtful, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
