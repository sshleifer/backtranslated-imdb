This movie was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, "The way the people in the Ohio Valley are!" I'm from the area and I experienced the movie as "The way people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there. We laugh a lot, call and pause with people our age; the young people went out together at night. Older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and no more pessimistic in the winter rain than anywhere else. <br /> Besides the "if you live in a manufactured house you must be depressed" condescension, history lacked elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of dread. <br /> <br /> Martha's character was the most evil. It is doubtful that someone so repressed belonged to a church, but if she had, she would probably have made friends there. I read comments that seem to assume that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, prettier and slimmer," but if this is the case, it is not shown. All we really see is that Martha is learning not to like Rose for reasons that would apply the same way if the three friends were the same age and sex. We see Martha feeling excluded during smoking sessions, set aside when social plans are made, used, but not appreciated, and finally disrespected and hurt. <br /> <br /> Just one more thing: should we suspect? Kyle's murder because he already had some panic attacks? Please. This brings the stigma against mental illness to a new level.
