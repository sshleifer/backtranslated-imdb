Okay, so Mr. Agrama's company (which is involved in some dubious deals with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) produced a horrendous mishmash by Mr. Carl Macek. <br /> <br /> What is this horrible mish-mash? I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three entirely unrelated Japanese science fiction series (Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONS of dialogue - firmly believing that the American public is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence -, edited the lot all for violent content, added some mumbo jumbo metaphysics, dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors on that side of Inferno's performance (Reba West's song was - and still is - unbearable and a total outrage, especially compared to Ms. Mari Iijima ) ... And the result was a series of 85 episodes with hundreds of continuity problems and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Of course the mecha were cool to look at (especially those in the "Macross Saga") and the parts of the plot that remained unharmed were good. But whatever was good at Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "voice talents" he was recruiting. It was because of the efforts and efforts of the (uncredited - why? I would be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who ended up knowing about the real deal and compared the originals with Robotech now wish we had never been exposed to Robotech. The originals are much better, of course, and make a lot more sense. <br /> <br /> Robotech, however, did something worthwhile: it took legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of Japanese anime creators. intellectual property of such unauthorized and unnecessary rework that untalented people such as Carl Macek produce.
