I LAUGHED A LOT! Not a bad way to start. I thought this was original, but then I discovered that it was a clone of the KING KONG remake in 1976. I have never seen KING KONG until the age of 15. I saw this movie when I was 9 years old. The disco funk music from the movie will get stuck in your head! Not to mention the theme of the film of the Yetians. This is the worst creature effect I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a holy grail of the B movies. Memorable quotes: "Take a tranquilizer and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you'll have Yeti power." I remember seeing this movie in the MOVIE MACRABE presented by Elvira. There is a scene where it was like KING KONG in reverse! In KING KONG, he takes the girl and climbs the building, but in this movie he descends from the building and takes the girl (who was falling)! Also in that year, another clone of KONG, MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977), came from Hong Kong. There are many matte travel scenes and motorized body parts. This movie will make you laugh. It's like I said, just another KING KONG clone. Graduate evaluated by violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
