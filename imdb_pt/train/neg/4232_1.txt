Karl Jr and his father are now running an army on a remote island. They catch a trio of guys stumbling on the island. Who after a while to fight back. (well, the survivors) This one has blood, gore and carnage without stopping, which would have been good if any of them seemed remotely real, or if the production did not seem to have been made with a week's worth of money saved (I may be overdoing it there it was probably only a couple of days). The horrid dubbing did not bother me that much and I suspect if I was really drunk, some might have been a little funny ... maybe. But as it is, at only 78 minutes the movie still seemed a long time by ... Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> My notes: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Bonus movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and Trailers for other films released by Shock-o-Rama
