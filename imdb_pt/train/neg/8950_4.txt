I've heard about this novel for a long time, many of my friends recommend that I read it. I searched everywhere and finally found it. This is a book that every man should read, because it is genius and because of his vision. I liked all the pages. <br /> <br /> I knew about the movie and could not wait to see it. When I finally did, I was very disappointed, many things that are in the book are not in the movie (I do not think this is a spoiler) that just makes the movie not be logical ... Michael Radford may be a good director, but one bad writer. Especially as a book adopter. The film is not at all dark, the writing is very bad, the only good thing, even great, is acting. John Hurt is an incredible actor and the only face I could see myself as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What annoys me the most is the people on the IMDb who called it "The Best Adaptation Ever" without even reading the book. ! Or know anything about screen writing! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the brightness of the story by reading the book, do not consider this as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points I gave for this movie go to the acting.
