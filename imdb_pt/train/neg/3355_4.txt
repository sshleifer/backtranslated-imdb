There were only two things that kept me interested in this movie: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This was basically a show of a woman. Catherine Zeta Jones was there just to have a look in her eyes. Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this movie. Like Jones, he had no paper. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one who had any real part in this low-quality script by David Self. OK, it was his first and he redeemed himself with Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the problem with director Jan de Bont was. He did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. He really fell for work here. Maybe he was still recovering from the disaster. Speed ​​2: Cruise control. He should thank his lucky stars for the Wild Wild West, otherwise this would be the worst portrait of 1999. Avoid at all costs.
