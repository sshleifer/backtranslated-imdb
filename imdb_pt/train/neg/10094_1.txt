Mt sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie fans. We have seen almost everything, especially zombie movies. Now, we have seen many good and many bad zombie movies. This by far is the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting horrible, but the special effects, graphics and "zombie" makeup were the worst I've ever seen. If you can even call makeup (black eye shadow) This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by the cover. Because the movie cover is the only sweet thing about. do yourself a favor and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie that I went so far as to put a note inside the movie before returning it to the movie saying "This movie sucks, do not waste your time, come back now" hahahhaa I do not want anyone else to waste a good movie night in this movie! I do not even know how he got the ratings he did, t should be on the negative
