a very good story, good emotion ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? extremely well done and a good story destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry to say, but a 1 in voting ... this is what it deserves, I think Chris Shadley could come to a better end ... but maybe next time All this blood meaningless for nothing? the end would take the story to close to a 10, but this did not .... the end destroyed the whole story, I think most people are not thighs and when they go to the movies, want a good end, even if it's complicated ... but the only lame here is the end ... sorry
