"Deathrow Gameshow" by Mark Pirro, 1987, is a comedy of dark humor that is extremely tacky in many parts, but occasionally very funny, however. This film certainly could have been much better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely extravagant scenes make it difficult to observe at times, but the concept is funny and has a few hilarious moments. <br /> <br /> In the near future (the year 1991), the game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) presents a game show called "Live Or Die," in which prisoners sentenced to death have a chance to play for their lives and for money. Failing candidates run in the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs and other more bizarre execution devices, followed by applause from the studio audience. The show is, of course, more than controversial, and Chuck has made many enemies ... "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly flamboyant and bad in many ways, and the acting is terrible, but it is undoubtedly fun in many parts, especially if you are a fan of black humor. You have not missed a thing if you have not seen it, but it's definitely funny and a good waste of time. 4/10
