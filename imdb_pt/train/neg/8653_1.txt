I went into that hope that it would be the "thought-provoking" gem that people reviewed. I love indy movies and expected to dig this out too. knowing what a hot button I hope is actually entertained, maybe even see a perspective from outside. <br /> <br /> All I can say is wow ... if you go in for self-torture, or mutilation, then maybe you'll like it. Personally, I do not like the idea of ​​peeing or cutting myself, so I thought it was rubbish. bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad direction, bad edit .... I could continue. I have no idea why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10. that is misleading and ignorant. voting for a movie on IMDb is not setting a precedent! only allows other people to think that a junk bomb like this is good to watch, as long as it's controversial (this movie is not, it tries TOO HARD to be, but fails). <br /> <br /> You know the movie is bad when 15 minutes for it are praying that all the characters die horribly. unfortunately they die, but not in the painful ways that would have given the observer any justice or justification for having watched the two hours of crap they just endured. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, just do not even bother. I have this movie in a bargain box in my local video store for .50 and I feel stolen!
