The film had a lot of potential, unfortunately, was undone because of a weak / implausible plot, miscegenation error and general lack of content / substance. One of the obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, could not pronounce his own Arabic name! This may seem like a minor flaw, but points to the apparent lack of effort to pay attention to the details. Performance quality was uniformly well below average. <br /> <br /> The solitary saving grace of the film was the twist in the plot at the end; and a French song (I can not remember the title). Overall, it was a very bad movie, where Sean Connery was visibly in a bad mood.
