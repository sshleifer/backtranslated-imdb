SCARECROWS seems to be a spoiled horror and finds supernatural film. A group of thugs do a paramilitary payroll robbery at Camp Pendleton, California. They carry a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with plane orders to Mexico. Along the way, an ambitious thief decides to rescue the money that lands in a field of corn monitored by strange scarecrows. These are not just mediocre scarecrows ... they can kill. Performance is no better than the horrible dialogue. And the attempts at humor are not funny. Very low budget and filmed entirely in the dark. <br /> <br /> The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
