What can I say about this movie besides "I do not see it". I waited and waited and waited for something (or anything) to happen and just did not come. Watch surprisingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most of the screen fill time in a single movie. What are they doing? Are they solving a mystery? Are they collecting clues? Possibly, it's hard to say. At the end of the movie, after many radio signals are decoded (illegibly on some kind of PET monitor) and this guy gives some lectures, the plot is finally revealed and thrown aside as quickly as possible. Some aliens want to go back to their homeland and are so happy there that they want to blow up the land (I think they do not like to share the wealth). My guess is that they finished filming and saw their 35 minutes of work or art (rubbish!) And decided they would let the editing team turn it into an 88-minute feature film. Watch at your own risk, it's not even funny because it's so bad, it's bad.
