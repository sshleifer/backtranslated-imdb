I think I've seen worse movies, but this may be because I'm so tired of how bad these horror movies are normal. The killer monster thing is really really bad, basically it's a guy in some kind of green suit. There is a lot worse acting with regard to the film B, but do not think that for a second that was something stellar, no. In fact, he had a plot with substance, but he was still very stupid. Basically it's just a bad low budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic, this movie sucks, that sucks. The blood looks really fake in this movie. This is a complaint I have about all the horror of the new millinium, low blood, looks stupid. A horrible death scene with really fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a good bath scene
