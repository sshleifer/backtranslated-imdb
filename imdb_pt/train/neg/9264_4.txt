This inferior sequel based on the characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) worries about a marriage named Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They adopt a girl named Delia from a convent. Gene York on re-election to the congressman and he chairs the funding committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be around when unexplained deaths happen. It creates chaos when a metaphysical fair happens, such as stocks of numerology, therapy, counseling, yoga, tarot, among others are destroyed. Karen York hires a private eye (Michael Lerner) to investigate the strange and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> This TV sequence displays emotions, chills, scary events and bloody killing. Delia as Damien seems to dispatch new mysterious murder every few minutes of film, occurring horrible deaths. The main excitement is in observing that innocent new victim can be made by the medium special effects. In addition, the mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, however good secondary cast, such as Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and recently deceased Don S Davis, he was an Army captain turned into acting. As always, great musical score taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is exclusively for hardcore Omen saga followers. The film is poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Earlier and much better versions are as follows: Richard Donner's immensely superior original 'Omen' (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick); 'Damien' (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; 'Final Conflict' (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Rating: below average.
