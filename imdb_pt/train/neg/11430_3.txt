Ok, let me coined a new word here: polyphagia: The fear of polyamorous relationships. This is another one of a long list of movies that start by exciting the public about some kind of trio, just to become a penny and go to everyone preach about how much is needed and the only moral thing to find a monogamous solution. Only one person in a thousand understands the pleasure of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: in a few decades, polyphobia will be as false as homophobia, but guess who is too keen to see it? Soon the first time: the producers of this film. And many like that. Why even make some kind of ridiculously conservative, old-fashioned movie like that? Proud of having an open and unlimited mind about homosexuality, it completely ignores the fact that we live in an age when monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy, which in turn becomes swing and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing and mediocre girl movie. (But, dammit, I have to say, Heather Graham is the cutest thing alive.) <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
