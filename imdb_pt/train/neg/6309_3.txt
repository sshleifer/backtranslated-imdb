This movie had good intentions and a good story to work on. The director and screenwriter of the film failed miserably and created a flat and boring film strip that made me feel like I was back in the eighth grade social studies class of Mr. Hartford - in '67. What a waste, someone please take this story and make a real movie with it - the story deserves it. <br /> <br /> Whenever a scene had potential, all we had left were a few cliches, combined with black and white footage that we probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shameful. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light in this stuffy festival. The other performance was incredibly monotonous - it fits well into the movie and whoever played the Captain set a new low standard for line delivery. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept all the numerous movie flaws and are not worried about being admired or entertained but want to learn about the USS Mason, it is worth watching.
