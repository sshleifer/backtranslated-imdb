I consider myself a little snobbish when it comes to everything, and although the cinematographic experience is more suited to explosions than to great dramas, I can also be very attached to movies. <br /> <br /> Not all art films, however, are better than King Kong. I would possibly give Kong two stars, twice the result of the movie. <br /> <br /> My guess is people were so excited about it because it was almost identical to what you can see in a play. For less demanding art aficionados, a movie that looks like a play is "great art." <br /> <br /> This movie, however, was useless. <br /> <br /> There was virtually no story. then it depended on great drama. The only drama in this movie was whether the cat would fall off the roof or not. So deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Great acting? Difficultly. <br /> <br /> Being overly fair: Some of the landscapes were interesting: communist apartments, city sights (Petersburg?) and Soviet trams still in service.
