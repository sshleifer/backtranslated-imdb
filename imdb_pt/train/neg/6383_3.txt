Gayniggers from Outer Space is a foreign film about black aliens that explore the galaxy until they come across Earth. Being gay, its goal is to have an exclusively male universe in which all people are gay. So when they discover that women or "female creatures" live on Earth, they are terrified at first; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and free the male population. <br /> <br /> An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist plot, though probably intended as a satire, gives this movie some shock value. However, there is little substance underneath. As another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes other than the names of the characters (eg ArmInAss); I think I laugh once with a little gay joke. I think I got to the point of the movie quickly, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I've had enough; I kept wanting the movie to end already (and it's a short film!). It is not brilliant or particularly well written.
