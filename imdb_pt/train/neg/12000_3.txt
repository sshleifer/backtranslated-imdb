The only possible way to enjoy this movie is to bang your head against the wall, allow an internal brain hemorrhage, let a lot of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded, maybe then * YOU CAN * appreciate this movie <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the taxi driver and the British as well. Maybe if they had created the whole movie on their adventures in India and as they eventually fell in love, it would be a much nicer movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave a 3rd note is because of Govida and her acting ability when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted unnecessarily. Moreover, the re-union scene at Heathrow was too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the post-Sept. 11 world, Anil Kapoor would have been shot long before he even made it to Sky Bridge to profess his true love :) But again, the film's purpose was to challenge logic, gravity, physics. and throw an egg into the public's face * GENERAL *. <br /> Watch at your own risk. At least I know I have scars for life :(
