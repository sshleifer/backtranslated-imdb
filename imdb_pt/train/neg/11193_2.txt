OK, I did not have high expectations, but this movie going down into depths I could not imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot, so to speak, involved a priest of an obscure order of 2 members investigating the founder's death. of order by a Sin Eater. The Death Eater allows Catholics to achieve salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in the movies with much boredom. No matter that it does not make sense since then, a Baptist could give you salvation ... we will move on. <br /> <br /> I will plan the plot without giving too much: the priest goes to Rome with his friend to investigate. He brings with him a mental patient (I'm not inventing) who shot him during an excorication and who loves him (can not explain a single lick of that BTW), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller as cardinal. They arrive in Rome, find scary kids who do nothing in the movie, meet an anti-pope S & M thug who the drunken Irishman knows (he did not explain) and who gives information killing people (oh, BTW, he's a bad guy so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... um, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot snakes around. Heath shatters with Sin Eater, flies to New York with Sin Eater for an overnighter and then some other things happen and then (all out of the scene) the anti-pope falls and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> An hour in the movie, someone really wonders if something happened. In the end, something happened, but you can not be sure that this is important, and since most of the drama happens before or after the change, you're really feeling cheated.
