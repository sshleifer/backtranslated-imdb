I usually have no problem getting away from a bad movie, however this was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I really sat the whole thing down, almost praying for it to have a minute of good movie to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. Set in a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacations, this movie suffers from numerous problems, making it not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Second, very few of the C list (I dare not call them B) actors can act very well, so any scene that has potential fails miserably. Third, the film's fee is too unstable and clumsy to watch most of the time, making it quite difficult to build suspense, leading to few surprises for the public. Fourth and most importantly, the end is completely anti-climatic partly because of how it ends (setup / who the killer turns out to be) and partly because the dialogue is simply atrocious. For movie credit, it's the only movie I'm going to say it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, as a bad joke, you would have been all the happier ever listening, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be screaming no, you really do not as you run in the opposite direction.
