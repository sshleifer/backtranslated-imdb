... Bad to be intentionally bad ... <br /> <br /> This little stone shot straight into the big screen of the MST3k. While it is obvious that the film is not trying to be taken seriously (hopefully that's their goal, anyway ...), the film is still clearly bad. Hell, makes Leprechaun In Space look great budget ... <br /> <br /> In short: Paint my colorful plum muscle car!
