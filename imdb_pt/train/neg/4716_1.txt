This show is monotonous, lame and basically rips all sorts of things to make it "original." First: The animation is so ugly ... Johnny is horrible ... and everyone is annoying. The twins look like teenage Dexters from Dexter's Lab, and Johnny is almost like a smarter man, Dee Dee (also from Dexter's Lab). Second: The plots are painfully lame, making them difficult to follow. The jokes are cheesy and nothing makes me feel compelled to laugh a little ... especially when trying to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but only they turned me off. <br /> <br /> Third: All theme song starts with Green Day's "American Idiot." And while I'm not a big fan of this band, I think it's really stupid that they take the same opening melody , and then subtly changed, to make their own. <br /> <br /> On the dot ... it's a big, ugly dump. 1/10
