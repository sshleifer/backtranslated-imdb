I stopped watching lost in this episode because I thought that the deaths of Ana Lucia and Libby were unnecessary and really depressing. Then I discovered that they kept Libby close by just to die in the next episode! Gah! I can not handle it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this show for the first season, but it definitely declined in the second season, I found Jack's annoying little religious quarrel and annoying Locke. The deaths of the characters of Rodriguez and Watros were the last drop! <br /> <br /> I give this episode a 4/10, for being the end of my showing of this old series created by Alias ​​legend, J.J. Abrams. I hope your series in the future will improve on this.
