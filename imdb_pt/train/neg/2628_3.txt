Director Sidney J. Furie created at Hollow Point an absurd postmodern masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares question the tired traditional conventional paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterization' when you remove the minds of 'motivation' and 'reason'. <br /> <br /> The result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> Q. Nothing in this movie makes any sense, law enforcement agents are utterly despicable, and organized criminals are full of insanity.
