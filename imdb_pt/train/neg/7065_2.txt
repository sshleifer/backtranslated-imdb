OK, well, I found this movie in my dad's movie stack and it looked pretty good from the cover, but the movie really sucked !! OK, the first story with the swimmer was very good, but it took a while to get in, so the boy's was completely retarded! It was not scary either! Your dream sounds like the story of a little kid at bedtime. So the news girls were completely retarded too. I'm sure someone will call the news guy and ask him to go out with you. But that ended up cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on TV and he told all that junk to her. Then it was a pretty happy story about the guy who brought back the dead people ... It's so stupid I will not even say anything else about it. The latter was the best. It was not so scary, but the idea of ​​the story was really cool ... oh yeah, the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something. Then, when everyone finishes telling their dreams to each other, the losers enter the bus (TO THE HELL AHAHAHAH) and see all the people of their dreams on the bus (Ha). The end.
