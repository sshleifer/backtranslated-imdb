I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this movie, I still can not believe I got to watch it in its entirety. Was there really a point for the movie? And the end, well, I'm glad I never paid to see that terrible piece of pathetic excuse from a movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure without having hunted the facts. but is Dafoe married or see the terrible actress in this movie in real life if that was an attempt to launch his career? if so, I fear he must have failed .. <br /> <br /> I put this in hope that I can actually put someone off watching this movie, even if 1 person takes care of my comments and decides they would rather watch the painting dry I will feel that I did some good in the world if I had had the same advice ...
