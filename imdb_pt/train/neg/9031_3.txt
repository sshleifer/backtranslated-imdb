Payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come after. Why would a man get involved with the trophy wife of an implacable Mafia boss in the gangster mansion with suspicious thugs everywhere? Why would an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to take her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love? Certainly, the hero, here Kevin Costner, must have expected a reaction from her husband who gives the film an excuse to indulge in senseless violence and gore. Anthony Quinn, great actor he was, certainly deserved better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly when he grabs his Prince Charming. Stowe is fine, but his Spanish accent does not work. The appearances of the smaller players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a rock star disappearing.
