Has Bo Derek's debut film remained invisible for eight years? and this is how it should be! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director, is he practically Ed Wood of erotic cinema? Not that this is especially explicit, considering that Bo (typically with dark hair) was only 16 when the movie was made! John also wrote and photographed; does the latter result in some decent scenes of the Greek island scenario against which the narrative is defined? but the conspiracy is puerile and the dialogue atrocious! The character portrayed by male leader Peter Hooten was raised with Bo's family: they grew up as brothers and sisters, but now, as a teenager, the couple discovers that they are attracted to each other (but as I said, do not expect any sexual fireworks!). Still, the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists harbor an obsession throughout the film, that they are not just fools in themselves, but annoying in their implacability? Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized resort by the sea and expects a cruise ship to come in sight (which, of course, happens at the end); Is Derek even crazier? she longs for possession of a great old tub !! For the record, the couple is married until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Also involved in the non-events are the female town mayor and a lothario photographer who wants to make a model of Bo (and who, of course, incurs the wrath of the jealous Hooten). Occasionally, for no good reason, we are even treated to excerpts from the display of old Hollywood classics in an open-air movie theater for which the whole city gathers (among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! Ultimately, while Bo's ingenuity is undeniably charming, it is not enough to make up for the movie's numbness and amateurishness.
