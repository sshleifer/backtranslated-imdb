This is really a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble the book as much as possible. But the acting was horrible. In addition to Kate Beckinsale, whom I believe to be a true resemblance to Emma in the book, all the other actors were pushing too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he should be. He was often rude and offensive, had no feeling, and throughout the movie you could not see his love "growing up" by Emma. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "recapture" her lead role as well as her partner's. Also, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not look like a broken heart as she was portrayed in the book. The movie settings are also very bad. The costumes are even more. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more elegant and elegant way she does here. The ending is also very long. It's good that it resembles the end of the book, but it's a killer ending to a movie. And again, I do not see any sense of happiness before Mr. Knightley. To conclude, I believed that this adaptation was faithful to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed that the film was made without any budget. I'd rather see the "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it's clear that it was meant to be a "blockbuster," than watching these actors (except for the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) spoiling the entire script .
