Oh gosh. I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of the Ringu from Japan. Well, I think the US did their version too, but at least it was a complete remake. So sad. I really enjoy watching Filipino movies and knowing that some good things can come from such a small country, so I can not believe this has happened. Claudine and Kris are big names there, surprised to be affiliated with plagiarism. For any aspiring filmmaker out there in the Philippines: you do not have to lower yourself to make money. There are many movie buffs who are watching and enjoying Filipino movies!
