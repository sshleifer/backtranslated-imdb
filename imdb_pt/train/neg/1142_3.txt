You've been messed up and beaten in submission for my harsh statements about "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals" movies! Now comes another race in disappointing rediscovery: ninja movies! Many of them I've seen before, and let me tell you, they are not all they're ready to be! They usually do not adhere to the point. This, among all others, does not suffer from originality! What does a ninja have to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And this is not supposed to be a "martial arts" movie as well? Do many shots sound like an incredible action movie to you? Is blood the number one reason to love this to death? Are you going to spend a little of your hard-earned money with a lady singing in your transparent sweater? The answers to these important questions are found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. For even more absurd ninja fun, try checking the Godfrey Ho movies released by Trans World. You get what you deserve and that's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
