This film was basically Velvet Goldmine, if the writers of a group of five seized it and made it a t.v. movie version. The film does not have what Velvet Goldmine had, which was good acting, written and basically everything else. The movie had some of the worst writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It definitely had to be interesting. I know VH 1 has become a household name for theirs behind the music shows. which are much better than all of this, which would have worked if you were behind the musical episode, but did not do it and felt face down.
