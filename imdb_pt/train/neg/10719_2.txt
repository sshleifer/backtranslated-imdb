I would not say it totally sucked, but if it was not for Netflix I would not even have it in my house. Steve Martin's eccentric chairman of a chain of health food stores has no plans. He's not funny. It is another in a lot of SNL rejections that can only find prostitution work for the next SNL movie. The birth coach with Elis Fudd is as funny as the original. Amy Poehler simply goes through the same moves as she would with a 7-minute SNL satire that's as funny as SNL lately. The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes. The ending was predictable as soon as you heard that your character could not get pregnant. The subject could have opened up to other comic attempts, but it seems to be simple, not really funny or laughing.
