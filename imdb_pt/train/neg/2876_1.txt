I question the motive of the creators of this fictitious account of the motives of the BTK killer. Are they trying to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do not they think the people involved with this monster are suffering enough? What a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims! It was like a personality experiment: what bothers you the most, the slaughterhouse or the human murders? They used real names of some of the victims .... this movie was ghastly, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this film have used this tragedy for their own agenda! People need to wake up and redraw the line!
