I was bored, around 10 at night, so I watched this movie. And I could not stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the kids were acting like they were 11 years old just dismembered me. One of the children had a ring, which supposedly killed people after 3 or more years. It gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to take children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act as if everything was as important, as if Billy (the main character) did not eat the worms and the world ended. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for young children (excluding the fact that a 5 year old says "penis"), but not for teenagers or adults who do not want to waste time.
