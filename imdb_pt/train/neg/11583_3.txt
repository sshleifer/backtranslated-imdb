This movie features a wide variety of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so. Neither of them bears any interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping that things would improve and end up staying until the bitter end, but there was no reward for it. <br /> <br /> If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. For me, the action is not worth retold. Not that the story was that bad, I think you could say that I had some problems with the script - for example. I thought I stank. A look at the credits will show that there is a very strong cast here, used to no avail. Most of the old professionals in this movie do good work; of the actors I had not seen much before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger. That's all I can think of to say about this picture.
