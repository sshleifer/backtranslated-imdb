Given the people involved, it is difficult to understand why this film should be so confusing and tedious. Writer David Ward wrote the astounding film "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda had just won an Oscar for Klute, and Donald Sutherland had done an excellent job on films like "Klute", "Start the Revolution Without" . Me, "and" Kelly's Heroes. "Plotwise, the film is a caper tale, with a small gang of awkward clumsiness planning a major assault. At the same time, the film wants to be a satire, a series of comedy drawings of the kind that the NBC television show" Saturday Night "would do so well two years later.The bad result is that the plot makes the comedy pieces seem strange and forced, and the disconnected parts of the comedy destroy any suspense the assault may have. which continues to crack, just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes intersect. <br /> <br /> The only real interest for me was to watch Jane Fonda. <br /> <br /> Your "Iris Caine" is supposed to be a cheerful version of your character dramatic performance of prostitute Bree Daniels in "Klute." However, no one believes her for a moment.It's always Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute we're watching.It's a performance as terrible as her performance in "Klute" "It was a good lesson for theater teachers to present the two films together to show how the same actress on the same type of role can be great or pathetic. This suggests that the actors are as good as their writers and directors.
