The title song for this movie ........... is the biggest free spirit ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in 1978-79 when I first signed up for the cable. By 1979, cable was just beginning to become a common place in homes. (or at least when it was becoming common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This may well be the first movie I ever watched on the paid channel called "The Movie Channel" - which was called "The Star Channel" at the time, they changed the name to "The Movie Channel "in the early 80's ........ I received a free month of" The Star Channel "with my new cable subscription. "The Van" was one of the films that were in high rotation on that network at that time. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie back then, and I thought it was a typical teenage movie (along the same lines as other medium budget teen movies ... those in which the plot revolves around nudity and <br /> <br /> I completely forgot that this movie existed until I recently saw this movie again after not having seen it for decades (I found a copy of it on DVD for sale in a cheap dumpster). I recognized it, and bought it for only $ 4.99. It seems that I had remembered that this movie was a lot better than it was (it is). However, watching it at that time was a <br /> <br /> It was fun to watch kids signing up for rock n roll, smoking marijuana and having sex on the back. <br /> <br /> A chic van (often at the same time <br /> <br /> There's not much of a plot beyond the f the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his archrival laughing with a good girlfriend ... he blows all the money from his college to buy a Dodge Van (with thick walls, mirrored ceiling and a water mattress) to get his attention, and he ends up having sex with her. But his arch-rival discovers and comes looking for him (so the two can solve their differences by dragging their vans) ... he and his arch-rival end up destroying the two vans and instead of stealing his arch-rival girlfriend, he earns the heart of a formal girl (less attractive) that he half / ass dates most of the film and he decides that he is happier / better and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> The movie has funny moments. But watching this movie more than 30 years later, it becomes yet another journey down memory lane. Because I can still remember pizzerias, pinball galleries, He also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked marijuana as we were screaming with pretty girls and waiting to get laid (sometimes I would get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a set with me and we would ruin in the back bank afterwords, I also remember many of the songs in this movement (when they were new) ...... this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those greetings (brought back many memories) <br /> <br /> the only thing that is pictured in this movie that I honestly can not remember is .... I never remember a time when full size vans were so popular as this movie portrays them as being. I remember this time very well, and I do not young people walking around wishing they had a van. Instead I remember youngsters in the 70s (self included). o) wanting a Trans Am Pontiac, Chevy Camaro or a hot rod Ford Mustang, but never a van This movie makes it look as if the vans were the most popular item and that every youngster wanted one (which was not true at that time)
