I was expecting a bit of "K-911", I mean it looked like a cute movie that I could get into. I've always loved the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was to be Jame's film, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests did not really have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the film, despite the fact that the writer was not going in that direction. James really pissed me off for more than half the movie. The dogs were the real stars and it is very sad that they have shone the actors. <br /> <br /> So, I'm glad it's not just me in IMDb who agrees that this was a very stupid movie. But, hopefully, James will realize that it was his brother Jim who was the talented, no offense, but not everyone can be his stellar brothers. Would not you like Ashlee Simpson to follow the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
