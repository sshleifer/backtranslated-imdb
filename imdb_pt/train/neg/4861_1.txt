In the glory days of the 90s (God rest your soul), you could call the great Comedy Central at any time of day and watch the greatest comedy show of all time Saturday Night Live. A glorious show that was, whether it was the original non-ready-to-Primetime players or the second golden age of SNL with the big names-Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then, everything went to hell . I was exposed for the first time to MadTV about a year and a half ago, and I think I must have fainted from shock. How could such a terrible show prevail for so long? There are so many horrible flaws. I suppose I'll start with writing. The writing, for the most part, is terrible. It's nothing more than kindergarten bathroom humor. The cast, for the most part, is untalented. There are some sketches I like, like some of Swan and Stuart, and there are some talents on the show like the magnificent Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, not just as a comedian. Although there are a few sparse moments, they are not enough to rescue this endless line of horrible nonsense populated by babbling fools. Miss this one.
