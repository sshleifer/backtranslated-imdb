The former brat pack actor and every cute boy Rob Lowe starred on a set in a high-security American prison. I had a feeling that his character would be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ, but PROXIMITY is not that kind of movie, it's more like a movie "Man on the run" as THE FUGITIVE. He also pays attention to issues of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting a tip as a justice spokesperson for victim pressure groups, but any clever discussion about how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into old and tired clich√©s. of shootings and car chases
