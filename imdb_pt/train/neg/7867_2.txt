Ok, I tried and I tried, but I still can not get this Guy Maddin thing. Tales Do Gimli Hospital made me cold, that movie about the Austrian villagers and the one about the Ice Nymph were beautiful to see but lacked in the story department ... and this nudist film about abortion and hockey is just plain boring. I'm glad Maddin has an appreciation for silent movies, but I do not like his films for the same reason I do not like Quentin Tarantino's movies: they are empty tributes to better, more imaginative films - movies that have advanced the art form or they have broken new ground - and they are all style and no substance. No amount of strange jumps and camera angles can disguise the fact that Maddin is an aspiring David Lynch without originality, although he has an advantage over Tarantino: he does not usually write embarrassing dialogues because most of his films depend on subtitles. The bottom line is, Maddin's schtick is clever and clever for great aspiring movies.
