15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially youth. When I was a 3-year-old boy living in the Philippines, I watched this show every Friday at ABS-CBN (Channel 2 over there). When the movie came out in 1995, it was a shock and dread for me when I watched with my father and two uncles. My grandparents even sent me a "Balikbayan" box full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy-to-ride Megazord and Ranger stuffed toys). I even played the video games and loved just one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was very sad. Anyway, it was the show that established a stepping stone in my interest in the series of robots (especially anime mech series like "Gundam"). Now that I'm 18, I would like to think that this show is very corny for me now. To prove it, I took a trip down memory lane buying a collection of 2-set DVDs with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and watched them both. I was like, "Ugh, how awful, just another garbage in the attic for me." For all of you of my generation, this is NOT a show you would like to watch over and over again. I'm not saying to leave you behind for the rest of your life, but occasionally it's not a bad thing right now, is it? Instead of Power Rangers, I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (also known as Ninja Robots), or even the original Sentai shows that were the basis of "Power Rangers ".
