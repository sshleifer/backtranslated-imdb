OK, a horror movie. a very, very stupid horror movie. <br /> <br /> We have your teenagers stereotyped in one thing at home. We got an FBI agent who saw Dirty Harry one more time. "So, what's the secret ... punks?" We have about 4 different camera shots and scenes that make no sense at all. "Hey man, I'm fixing the sprinklers" (Suddenly there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies, he's dead. <br /> <br /> They follow the killer in the middle of nowhere, with no cops. she is suddenly in a church wearing a wedding dress. I swear this is the dumbest horror movie I've ever seen.
