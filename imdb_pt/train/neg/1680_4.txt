Even with a cast that boasts such reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland does not produce any sense of depth for this film. He barely touches the surface of the incidents that happened that night of July 1981. Kilmer only analyzes the movements, since John Holmes, Kudrow, and Kate Bosworth are hopeful of being misunderstood in the other two leading roles; as Holmes' wife and minor girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has roles so small that it is impossible to get any dimension of them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a special guest starring Paris Hilton.
