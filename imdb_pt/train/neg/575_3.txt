This movie is not very good. It's boring and does not have much blood for a horror movie. The plot just trots along with not much happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters, since this shows that she has enlightenment as a reflex. But whenever she has one of them stuck, she just takes her time and something always happens where she does not bite them. No wonder this went straight to the cable. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: It's not nearly as good as the first Vampire movie. You are a SUCKER if you waste your time on this.
