I rented this movie because it fits into the genres of "romance" and "western" with some Grand Canyon scenery. But if you are expecting a typical romantic western, forget it. This movie is pure junk! The novel is between a GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE AGED MAN! The child is also coveted by other malicious men. It's sick. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous in trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and his character is primarily the one who pursues the relationship. He tries to startle her at first, but eventually he gives in and they leave as a happy and loving couple. It is revolting. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this movie can appeal to anyone except pedophiles.
