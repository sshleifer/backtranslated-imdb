There seems to be little in terms of middle ground where Watch On the Rhine is concerned. Or if he likes it very much, applauding his sincerity, his liberal point of view and his good acting, or he detests his obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and general tendency. I fell a lot in the latter category, and I found the film and game - about the European refugees' activities in Washington during the war - an overwhelming boredom, which is worth mostly for acting, and even then only intermittently. That author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. Her pieces were written for people who shared her point of view, and she rarely explored ideas that were not held by the author and the audience, except to show how terrible the "other side" is. Even when I meet one hundred percent according to what she has to say, as in Rhine, I still can not stand the way she says. Her characters are unreal, and while her ear for dialogue shows some ease in the way people talk, she has no real brilliance or originality. She really had nothing new to say. I fully agree with the delay of Hellman's late reputation of the late Mary McCarthy a few years ago. For those who think the theater is dead or in extremis and who yearn for the good old days, I ask you to take a look at Watch On the Rhine, as bad as Angels In America, which only serves to show that the theater had one foot in the grave sixty years ago.
