If you liked the first two movies, then I'm sorry to say you're not going to like this movie. This is the really unnecessary and direct junk for the video, probably TV made sequel. The still stupid but good scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and he has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid that he shrinks his statue and himself with your brother. Then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law, too. Now, adults have to find a way to make the kids in the house bigger. Practically a repetition of the other two with only one or two new things, eg. a toy roller coaster, swimming in diving, etc. Very poor!
