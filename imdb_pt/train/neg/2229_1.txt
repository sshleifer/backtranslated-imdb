Maybe that's not fair, because I only did it in the middle of the movie. One of the few movies that I really could not watch because of claudication. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is unreal and tacky. For example - during a coke deal, the coke is kept loose in a briefcase - I'm no expert, but I think people usually put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect. whenever a punch is played (it's that "crunchy" sound on top and they use toy guns with dubbed sound effects.) Worst movie ever.
