I got into this movie hoping it was similar to Matrix or Pi. Boy, was I wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written storyline, misinterpreted in the film (with animated CG cells and peptides). However, the real focus of the film is the "expert" heads who exculpate liar of the new era between the segments of the plot. <br /> <br /> Of course, he's innocent enough. There's a bit of real quantum physics in the beginning. It states, for example, that electrons exist as both particle and wave, and that an atom is mainly an empty space. However, the film takes a giant leap (and non-scientific), saying that subatomic quantum effects also happen on large scales. The talking heads go even further. According to them, the following are true: - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives could not see their ships because their minds were unable to perceive something so different. Meditation can reduce the homicide rate. -With positive thinking, you can walk in the water. - Your thoughts can change the formations of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> And only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. This movie looked like a movie they would show you to join a cult. After doing my homework, I realized that basically it's just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this can be seen as an exaggerated comedy (although not funny). <br /> <br /> Save your time and money: do not watch this movie.
