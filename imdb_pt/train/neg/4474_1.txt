waste of my life, .... the director should be ashamed. why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me. when she died in the end, it made me laugh. I had to change channels many times throughout the movie because I was getting embarrassed to watch such a bad performance. I hope the guy who played Heath never goes back to work. Besides, I hope the director never makes another movie, and has his pay received back for that crap. {.02 out of 10}
