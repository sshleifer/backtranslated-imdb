I agree with the comments I have read here, and I have no words to define a turkey like that, but I still can find a reason why there are movies like that. Do you remember those happy days when video was a thriving business, and many movies were made for the sole reason of filling the shelves of the rental companies? this film comes from that period and I can imagine that it was the only reason it was produced and so did many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember imitations of "Rambo"? and so many slashers of Z grade?, I still feel nostalgia for that period. About this movie I can say that I did not waste my time watching this because I pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes just to find a very funny scene where a guy was pushing an ax against the heads that exploded because, as you perfectly realize, they were made of plastic. And about the end, well, it was so poorly filmed that I could not understand what happened. That's the same, I had not followed the nonexistent plot at all. But man, the video-age was a great age despite movies like that.
