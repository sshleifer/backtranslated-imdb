I, having also endured hundreds of children's films in the past, consider it one of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I resent this day and age having to explain to my children that Russia is not "the bad guys". In addition, the Russian names that mock "Poopchev" are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) The scene of the grandmother's birthday party contained an almost sexist joke in which he suggested that men drink beer and women talk on the phone. Two other flies also needlessly use the word "crap" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The whole movie smells largely of the 1950s stereotypes and advertisements that I thought we, as a nation, were proud of being elevated. <br /> In all of this it's just gross, barely excited, even more poorly written and not worth wasting time to see.
