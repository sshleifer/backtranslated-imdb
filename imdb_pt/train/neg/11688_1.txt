My wife and I find this movie highly unsatisfying. While the plot keeps you interested and busy wondering what's going on, when you leave the theater, there are many loose ends that make no sense at all. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, the extremely wealthy boss of a NY bank, has a terrible hidden secret. Profiting with the Nazis and hiding the stolen plunder of the Jews, he keeps the evidence (including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika) in a safe in his bank. Because? If he wants this never to be revealed, why did not he burn and destroy the documents years ago? And the diamonds? Obviously, he does not need them - why save them instead of discarding them? How did bank robbers uncover your secret? How did they know to focus on this # 232 safe? Detective Denzel Washington also finds that bank records show 231 and 233 of SD Box No 233, but not number 232. Curious. He meticulously found time in some way to make an exhaustive search of bank records to discover this curious fact. All the while dealing with a situation of hostages and bank robbers threatening to start executing them momentarily. Wow!! Talk about super powers for a detective. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars worth of currency in the safe they opened. They take only the contents of SD Box # 232, ostensibly for the purpose of blackmailing the bank's president. This defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film describes as a criminal genius, or for its minions with smaller brains. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, using her political connections to the mayor of New York, gets permission to enter the bank that is under the control of bank robbers while holding many hostages. She offers the bank robber an agreement to buy back the documents he holds, but he is not interested. So what's your point (if any?). <br /> <br /> My wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players, Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (detective), and Jodie Foster, crack crack problems for high power problems. <br /> <br /> The last Jodie Foster movie I saw, "Flight Plan," was also full of holes that made no sense at all. I thought you liked Jodie Foster, but I'm probably going to avoid your future films. <br /> <br /> Now, my problem is that I rarely can convince my wife to go to the movies. I can not disagree with her about this one ... "A waste of money and a waste of time." Be warned. A well-worked film, good actors, bad script writing.
