Basically, it is a couple who wants to adopt a second child. In the adoption agency, they find a mouse (Stuart) and decide to adopt it. If you think this is stupid, hold it, because it is getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Spare me!) The rest is practically the usual cliché, about family problems, jealousy of the older "brother", and in the end all issues are resolved and all of them are a "happy family." Boring and worn out as it is, it is also shown in the most direct and unsophisticated way. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the director believed he was being creative by inserting a mouse into the cliché, or he was just trying to fill in minutes, but he just upgraded the boring cliché to disgusting. <br /> <br /> So why did I give a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat, who loves Stuart as much as the "brother". And because of some funny shows where Stuart makes good use of his small size. <br /> <br /> Overall I believe the film would work reasonably well if: a. Stuart was a pet and not a "brother". B. He'd kept the shows funny, like Stuart trying to fool the cat, and he'd brushed aside the boring cliches that did not even match anything else.
