After going through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered if it was really the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a movie. It was this indifferent and stereotyped. But American propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves - disappointingly - that it is the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like "We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage vomit lines like "I never use the Declaration of Independence as bargaining coin" with a serious face, my husband and I wondered if the whole cast took Valium before filming each scene. The "reasoning" behind every plot spin and new "clue" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also a secondary plot of misogyny, with dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being reprimanded by everyone involved for "never shutting up." She's clearly in the film just by appearance, but they felt the need to slap a "Dr." title on your character to give it some seriousness. At one point, Cage's character says, "You never shut up?" and the camera makes a mess for her, looking pouting at her hands, as if she were a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit of this movie was that it is so incredibly bad that you get some laughs. The really scary thing is that most of the people who watched the movie with us seemed to like it. Creepy
