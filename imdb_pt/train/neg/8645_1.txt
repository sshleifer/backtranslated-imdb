I just came back from this free exhibition, and this "Osama Witch Project" is the worst movie I've ever seen this year, worse than the "Catwoman" - which had the decency to at least pass for fiction. In "September Tapes," a "film crew" of "documentary journalists" goes to Afghanistan - despite being completely unprepared for travel, conditions, and oh yes, psychotic revenge and ridiculous leader of the filmmaker to avenge his wife's death on September 11 - to track down Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br /> They "made" eight tapes on their journey, which now "document" their travels, and of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, fortunately, end at significant points in the narrative, which is convenient for a "documentary.") The psychotic and idiotic protagonist - which is given to long and meaningful speeches that he probably learned to watch "MacGyver" - does not care about his own life or the lives of his innocent crew as he takes them further and further into danger through a series of completely stupid setbacks. I do not know why he did not just use a sign on his back that said "Shoot me." <br /> <br /> The translator of the team, supposedly his reasonable voice of reason, does little more than regret. and is perplexed when the idiot hero leads them to disgrace. <br /> <br /> You would like them to bring someone on your trip to call them idiots. Around "Tape 4," I began to hope that the terrorists would shoot the film crew.
