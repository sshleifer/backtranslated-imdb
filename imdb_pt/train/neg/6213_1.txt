This movie has become one of my 10 most terrible films. Horrible. <br /> <br /> There was not a continuous minute when there was not a fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except for the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) <br /> <br /> Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and The Matrix. <br /> <br /> The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br /> The spider machine at the beginning was just like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both movies) and wait ...... he hypnotizes (stung) his victim and surrounds them ..... uh hello ???? <br /> <br /> And the whole machine against the human theme was the matrix ... or the exterminator ... <br /> <br /> There are more examples, but why waste time? And someone will tell me what was with the Nazis?!?! Nazi's ???? <br /> <br /> There was a line of youthful history hastened to a youthful conclusion. The film could not decide whether it was a children's movie or an adult movie and it was not much of either. <br /> <br /> Just horrible. A real let down to say the least. Save your money.
