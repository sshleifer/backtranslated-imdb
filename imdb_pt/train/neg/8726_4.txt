Firstly, I want to say that this movie is worthy of more than the four stars I rated. I gave four stars because, for me, this 86-minute film always seems to be 2 and a half hours, and it's not interesting enough to go through it all. However, "The Great River Jacare" (the title that my DVD calls) is better than its medium nature rebates the film. <br /> <br /> A tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia is just opening up and employing the natives as it tries to manipulate the wildlife around. Mother Nature in search of revenge comes in the form of the god Kroona, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing that the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are being mopped the wrong way too. <br /> <br /> This movie is a well-made horror / adventure story with a good musical track and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the film, is obviously false. Some of the close-ups of your jaws are good, but that should be all we need to see. Some of the distant underwater shots make it painfully obvious that we are dealing with an alligator toy that you can probably buy at a zoo souvenir shop. But the natives are believable, if not authentic. <br /> <br /> Probably not the movie that will give you unbroken thrill, if any, but that was filmed and produced well enough to get good mention. And like many creature films, this one ends with an extremely high body count. It also has many good jungle settings. Acting is below average, but who was hoping it would be better, huh? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than the recent American counterpart "Primeival" but nothing compared to "Jaws". But remember that you may not be involved in some points.
