For romantic comedies I often judge the quality of the film based on the cloudiness of my eyes until the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "The Wedding Date", I can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I did not see much chemistry between them. two characters. The premise of the film is a reverse "Pretty Woman," with Dermot playing the role of Nick, a high-priced escort hired by Debra Kat's character to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there were not enough romantic sparks in Nick and Kat's relationship. <br /> <br /> In a supporting role, Amy Adams was a highlight as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy entered the screen, it served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. Maybe, if Amy Adams had been cast as Kat, the movie might be more buoyant. But in the end, instead of looking for the Kleenex, I was looking for Visine trying to at least pretend that this film had some genuine feeling and romance.
