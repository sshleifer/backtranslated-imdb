I saw the comment of the capsule saying "great acting". In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with each other, by a great director in his worst endeavor of all time. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance uncomfortably spreads across the map because she clearly has no control over this character, mainly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses would be a very quick adjective for the excruciating rhythm of this movie. While the movie's intent is to be an edifying story about curing illiteracy, watching it is a real "bummer." I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for your budget level I've ever seen.
