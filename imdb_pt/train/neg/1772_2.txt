"Sleepwalkers" is the first film for which Stephen King wrote a screenplay. Faced with this, and the excellent music of Saint and Johnny that they used as the theme of the film, you would be expecting a strange and ultimately rewarding viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you would be getting. The thing is, they probably could have made a good movie. The beginning is intriguing with its scary small-town atmosphere. But something strange happens about 20 minutes in the movie. The movie looks funny for no apparent reason! From that moment on the whole atmosphere of "Sleepwalkers" is ruined. For those of you who have seen it, who can forget the good old Johnny shouting "COP KABOB !!" after jabbing the pencil in the policeman's ear?!? But do not get me wrong, humor has no redeeming quality. I just rented it again to see if I was wrong the first time given the originality of the plot, but I was right. Dude, what a waste. I can not believe they have the rights to that song from Saint and Johnny. I gave it to 2.
