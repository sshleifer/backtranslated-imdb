Sequels have a bad habit of being disappointing, and the best credit I can give is that it retains that old tradition. These three tales are not as good as the original Creepshow. By far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol that comes alive to take revenge on the bad guys who killed their owners. The second story is about a lake monster that seems to be nothing more than a bunch of floating trash, makes you wonder how anyone could be scared of it. The third story includes a special guest appearance by Stephen King as a truck driver, but other than this is a rather memorable tale about the victim of a traffic accident that returns from the dead to the person who knocked him down. <br /> <br /> Watch the original Creepshow, or if you've already made it, then be happy with it.
