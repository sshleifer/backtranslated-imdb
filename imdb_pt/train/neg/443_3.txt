Overall, an extremely disappointing image. Very, very slow build up to the basic plot. The role of Maria Schrader in search of the secret past of their families. (Every take seems to last forever ?? There's really no rhythm in the movie). *** SPOILERS *** His mother Ruth is rescued from the Nazis by a German woman, played by Katja Riemann. Ruth's whole character is so one-dimensional, so stereotyped. *** SPOILERS END *** The movie goes back and forth between New York and Berlin and Berlin, something of the 1940s. Please, when you do, give the audience an indication of exactly what time the story takes place. Is there never a clear indication of time? very irritating. The worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and chatter about the Jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me some time. Is that how the Jews left Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed the Jews is never answered. Was Goebels who freed them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice, the film won an acting award for K. Riemann, why? ??? I have no idea. Should it be the Jewish theme?
