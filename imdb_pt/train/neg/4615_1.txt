I may not have the longest attention span, but this is the second movie that I refused to see until the end, and I even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. At first I thought the director was making a big joke, so I waited for a resolution, something to laugh at, something to keep my interest, but that resolution never came. Instead, the writing was ridiculously amateur, the film crawled and felt disjointed, as someone who cut a long-running TV series. The Academy must be stoned when they named this movie for no less than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> Once again, I repeat myself. This is the second movie that I refused to watch all the time. The first was "Terminator". I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1/10
