Save the $ 8.97 you will spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go see the actual Steven Spielberg movie. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker, and being an avid fan of HG Wells, I had to buy this hoping to sit back and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching because I could not stand watching for more than 10 minutes at a time. It's awful. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a budget of $ 20 million for this production. Where the hell was he? Did he use most of it to buy a new home? Finance Your Retirement? Or what? Let me start with what's really good about this movie. He remains faithful to the book And there are some good performances in it. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good movie. But good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible ... and I mean horrible special effects. Any freshman student could have done a much better job with CGI. For me, most seemed like clippings of stop cards that were used instead of sophisticated computer graphics programs that a $ 20 million project was supposed to use. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this movie. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1,500 and one day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what Hines created. I've seen movies with budgets of under $ 2 million look better. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than the special effects of Hines in this film. In fact, I really appreciate Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this movie. There are no excuses with the current technology for a movie to look like a B-Movie from the 50's, unless that was the intention, which should not have been with that particular project. <br /> <br /> A problem I had with the transfer of the DVD The film is a rough move, another demonstration of amateur production of films. Overall, I must say that I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 that has better photography and special effects than this movie. /> <br /> I strongly encourage anyone who enjoys good film production or who is a WOTW fan to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. It would be easier for the eyes.
