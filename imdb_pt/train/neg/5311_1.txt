This is almost the worst movie you have ever seen! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the rug underneath this one, for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa once called "cheepnis". It looks like the space scenes were made in a 50's power station, just before the demolition. The music really sucks. The performance is made of wood and ham. The characters they portray are superficial and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It's immediately and blatantly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of the direction beggar belief. <br /> <br /> But you have to see if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest waste of a small budget ever. This is an invaluable example of a stupid movie!
