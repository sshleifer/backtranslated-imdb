This movie could have been so much better, especially considering the talent. Larenz Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. He does not lip sync and his mannerisms are Larenz Tate, when it should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrait of women as a bunch of prospectors has been writing Hollywood all over. The powers that obviously forced him, but only made the characters more unrealistic. The good points of the film were the portrait that Miguel Nunez did of Little Richard and the participation of the own Little Richard. Lela Rochon is eyeshadows, as always, even in a conservative role. It's a shame that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox have been wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this movie was a wasted opportunity.
