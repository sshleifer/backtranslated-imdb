Ursula Andress's naked body is one of those things that makes you believe in God. The other two women (especially the maid) also have large bodies. So why the highest degree I can give a movie with such quality and amount of nudity is only 3 out of 10? Because to get to the unbelievable body of Ursula, we have to watch a movie that is bland and boring (remember that I watched the full version of 101 minutes, not the American version of 78 minutes that probably cuts the foreign material a lot ). In the typical Italian-comedy tradition, most characters are exaggerated caricatures (the army's aberration, the "latin lover," the steady drunk, the naive maid) who are not funny, simply exaggerated. Final Word: Watch this, but keep your finger on the fast forward button, you will need it. (*)
