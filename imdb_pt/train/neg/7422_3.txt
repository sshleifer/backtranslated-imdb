Well, I could not get into the plot, but that's just me maybe. Indifferent camera moves sometimes, however, this movie has a lovely vintage quality. The acting is genuine at times and amusing with the occasional chase sequence involving half-naked ladies, which was cool. The climax is confusing and disjointed, but still ... erre batted, thanks to Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Stunts are interesting, especially because of the 1970s Las Vegas scenery. There are a few camera moves at the end that let me guess for a while. But I do not think I'll chase the DVD, yet.
