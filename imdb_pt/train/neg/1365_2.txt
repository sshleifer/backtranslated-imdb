The concept of the gray legal area in Crimes of Love contributes to about 10% of the film's appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to their blatant evil. To say that Sean Young's performance as the so-called public prosecutor is wood is a gross understatement. With his nice suits and superfluous hair gel, Young does a decent job of convincing the public of his devoted male hatred. Why else would she ask her only friend to be a prostitute just to arrest cops trying to get them? This hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind that shitty movie. Watching Young goes from the frigid nudity to the frontal completely does little to increase interest, but the tantrum she throws next to a fire near a lake does. Watching her rhetoric and raving about her self-loathing and sexual frustration makes love crimes worth the rental fee, but it's all down and from there. Despite his desire to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice, his policing skills escape him completely at the height of his tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent job as a viscous sociopath; if it worked on Sleeping With the Enemy, you can certainly work on it. But I can not help but wonder if the remarkable lack of energy that Young brings to the film conflicts with his scarcity. I'm assuming yes and the result is a thriller with emotions that are completely bad and yet comical.
