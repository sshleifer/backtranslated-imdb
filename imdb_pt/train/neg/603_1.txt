Absolutely laughable movie. I live in London and the plot is so poorly researched that it's ridiculous. No one could be terrified on the London subway. In the short time is not in service every night there are teams of maintenance workers downstairs checking the clues and performing repairs, etc. That there are homeless people living there is equally unlikely. Or that it's even possible to be locked up and not have access to a cell phone nowadays ... <br /> <br /> The worst that can happen if someone is there after the last train is that they can receive graffiti sprayed on them. Although this has been under control due to the large number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember London as a whole, we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> If it had been set in a city I do not know, maybe I could have liked it because of ignorance, but it's not a high-quality movie, so I just could not suspend my disbelief and try to take advantage of it for the banal tale that it is. <br /> <br /> I would have given 0/10 if such an evaluation existed! Possibly the most disappointing movie I have ever thought I would like.
