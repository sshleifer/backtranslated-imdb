a friend of mine bought this (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought I would never watch because I knew it was a joke and the DVD cover looked pathetic but then my friends and I got really bored and watched. from beginning to end! I know quite a conquest, but it really is a masterpiece. is difficult to describe. you should see, it's a true lesson about what people are capable of when they believe they are creative and intelligent and really are not. The "acting" is sous-terrain (you can see the laughter of the "protagonist" on some occasions, it is definitely the worst). the "story" is stupid to be summed up and really everything in this movie sucks. please pay special attention to the "sheriff". the guy is an adult and so he has absolutely no excuse to get involved in it. it is extremely bad too. whatever has had some hilarious moments. check it out haha
