I was looking forward to this tour, and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I have fun too easily on the roller coaster and in the amusement parks. <br /> <br /> The part of the roller coaster was just ok - and that was all in about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride. <br /> <br /> It was visually annoying and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Desperately trying to be like a mix of the more distant rides of Indiana Jones and Space Mountain and Disneyland, and failed in every way. <br /> <br /> It was neither exciting nor exciting. at least.
