This was a disappointing horror film about a grumpy young woman and her nightmares. For a movie or exaggeration of terror or "suspense", it is very tame. There are only a few tense moments here, not anywhere as close as it should have been to a movie of that genre. Even those "tense" scenes were not much. The music made them more dramatic than they really were. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism here, so elitist critics label this "horror movie of a thinking person." Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they'll come to the same conclusion as me - a waste of money at the video store. <br /> <br /> Summary: A yawner who offers a main character and usually poor acting. Vastly overrated and certainly not what is advertised.
