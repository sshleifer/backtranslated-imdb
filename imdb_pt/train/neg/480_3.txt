2 stars for Kay Francis - she's wonderful! And she did not deserve this horrible nonsense than Warner Bros. threw in your direction! <br /> <br /> The dual premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable to the extreme. Kay is a small-town woman and mother who yearns for something greater: she wants to be an actress. When a great actor arrives in the city and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, Kay tells her husband to go to the movies. A mother's mother, her husband's, insinuates in her husband's ear that Kay is not being truthful, and he searches for her. He finds her with the actor in the hotel (they're just talking!) And he nudges the guy, who falls on a railing, falls face-first into a lake (lake?) And dies. Now here are the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the film is based: 1) The judge tells the jury that if it is determined that the man died * before * his head went to water, they must find the husband guilty of murder in the first degree. (Whaaaa ?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder of at most 2 not first degree murder. found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to jail for life. <br /> <br /> 2) The husband's lawyer, after conviction and sentence, tells Kay that it's all her fault. Her reasoning is that if she had not gone to the actor's bedroom, her husband would not have to go after her and kill the guy. He tells her that she is to blame, not the husband, and she agrees and agrees. What. The hell?!?!?! The rest of the film is about Kay trying to get fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and certain the wrong she has committed, causing him to kill the actor in the first place. <br /> <br /> I can not even continue with this review. The movie was very painful. Four years earlier, on pre-coded days, you would never have caught Kay playing such a coward! In Kay Francis's true fashion, though, she did her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I give him a lot of credit for trying to give a little life and credibility to this ungrateful role. This character was a far cry from Kay's pre-coded roles and Kay Francis's real life. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles out there! (From personal experience, I can highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery; Dr. Monica and One Way Passage are also good.) I'm sure there are other great Kay films as well, but I'm just mentioning the ones I've seen and can recommend.)
