Where to start, this movie started badly and ended badly! It consisted of extremely unreal and unrealistic effects that made me shrink in my place, seriously, my cat could have acted better than this lot. <br /> <br /> Part of this was laughable because it was unbelievable, i would have rated it lower, but they have nothing left! So pay attention to my warning, and unless you're so bored with suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission, do not bother with this one. I'm still in shock that this can actually be released to the public, this should be a crime and everyone involved should be arrested. I understand that you have the essence now, so I'll leave it to you to decide.
