A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child, the fifth installment of the series Nightmare on Elm Street and the worst continuation of the series, even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was fortunate to get Nightmare on Elm Street. DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequences. The dream son was the worst, no doubt, I was surprised too, since they were doing so well with the last two sequences. But I think they lost the charm, the story was ridiculous and I was not happy with the place. Alice ended up becoming more annoying, she's not Nancy or Kirsten, so she carrying this movie alone did not work for me. Freddy is also losing his fright, this was getting a little silly. <br /> <br /> Alice is back and she is carrying a child, she could not be happier with her life. But Freddy is back too and he will not be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie. But anyway, he wants his son and be born again in the world. Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too? Well, that's what The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon discovers what Freddy's childhood was like and that maybe that's the only thing that can defeat him. <br /> <br /> A nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Child is just a bad movie and an insult to the series. I do not think anyone could be happy with this sequel. Just the story was really silly, I mean it could have worked, but again, it was executed the wrong way. I know if you are looking to see the sequences for the series Nightmare on Elm Street, you should watch, but I really do not recommend it, it's not worth it, at least in my opinion. <br /> 3/10
