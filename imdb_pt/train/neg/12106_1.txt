A cowardly and cowardly film. Director Boorman shows Cahill robbing rich homes, but the male occupant is shown being unfaithful to the sitter, that's fine then. The forensic scientist investigating Cahill is blown up in his car, but he is unlucky and does not look like a nice man, so that's fine too. The Beits, owner of Russborrough House, made money exploring 'darkies' digging diamonds, so it's okay to steal invaluable art and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow mountains. The Garda kill their ferrets and are implicated in their murder. Moral equivalence is revolting, Boorman is looking for a blockbuster film, but he has no courage to stand up against the gang gang's crime, which terrorized the neighborhood and set off another wave of contempt for Dublin. He even called the General's son while doing this. Disgusting. Shame on her cowardice.
