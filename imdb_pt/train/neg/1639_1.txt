"Whipped" is 82 minutes long. This review has 82 words. Three unfortunate New York Lotharios, implacable "coups", end up courting the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. This applies to the story and the movie. Too distressed to be misogynist, flabby, and ridiculous, "Whipped" blends the philosophies of shocking Tom Lykis with the fantasies of the Penthouse letter. Although technically proficient, it is dated, grater, poorly written, stingy and obvious. People do not act like that. People do not talk like that. Same.
