Horrible acting, bad story plot, tacky makeup, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes in which I decided to move quickly to see if anything redeeming would happen ... It did not happen. (In addition to a good chest shot) The film was apparently filmed in some furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse was used by at least 90% of the sets. You even see that same red chair in several different "places". If you are going to make a movie, at least rent an office building and an apartment, not some warehouse that echoes all the dialogues of your actor ... (Note to producers) small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than a whole warehouse, and both are a bit more versatile and believable) If you spend your money to rent this people, I hope you have a money back guarantee ... You will require your money back .. I just spent $ 2.99 to rent tonight and feel stolen.
