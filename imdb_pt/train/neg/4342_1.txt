I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a good plot to go on, but it spoiled everything. First of all the cast is all wrong, where does that van peeble (actor crap btw) and dad puff come ??? It seems Carlito came from the neighborhood and used to be with some real idiots. This movie does not "Carlitos Way" any justice. I'm so happy that the sequence "Carlito's Way" came out first, if I had seen this crap first, I would never have given the pacino version a chance. And anyway, the Pacino supposedly read this story, thought it sucks and made the sequel in its place. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 in 10 Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.
