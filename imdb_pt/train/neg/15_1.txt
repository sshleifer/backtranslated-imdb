It is. It's that. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. That beats everything. I've never seen worse. Retire the trophy and give to these people ..... there is simply no comparison. <br /> <br /> Even three days after watching this (for some reason I still do not know why) I can not believe how insanely horrible this movie is / was. It is so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or anything that should ever have been created and brought into our existence. This has made me question whether or not humans are actually placed on this earth to do good. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This kind of film, honestly, hurts us like a society. We should be ashamed. I really can not emphasize that our overall responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to avoid creating those gross distortions of our reality for our own good. It is an embarrassment. I do not know how on earth any of these actors, writers or the director of this movie sleeps at night knowing they had a role in doing "Loaded". I do not know what kind of disgusting monsters like to watch these kinds of movies. <br /> <br /> That said, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad". <br /> <br /> But this ....... this crosses the line of "bad" in a new dimension. This is very bad. This is the bad where you know everything that will happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence BEFORE they happen; and not just like a second or two before, I mean after watching the first 5 minutes before. <br /> <br /> Each tacky editing "effect" is blatantly used repeatedly for a sick spot. I really never want to see the camera "unstable" "drug buzz rush" effect or skip cuts or skew cuts or ANY FANCY CUT EVER AGAIN EVER EVER. This is meticulously annoying, repetitive and just torture the public. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production, it seems that a decent amount of money was actually put into that excrement . Personally, I'll grab the headmaster's shoulders if I ever see him and shake him, demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of O-Drain, or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever needed a new form of inhuman torture for our prisoners of war abroad, let us continue to show them this movie in a padded cell again and again. Believe me, I think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time they go through it. <br /> <br /> Stop these movies, they are just the most vile of all facets of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
