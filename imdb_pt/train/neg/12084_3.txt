Take: <br /> <br /> 1. a famous piece <br /> <br /> 2. a director with ideas now own who is using <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the stage drawing of a popular theatrical production of the piece mentioned in 1. 4. An actor for the leading role - who has no feeling for the role that is playing And you will have: "Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark" I heard the radio play of "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I were very disappointed. I hoped the filmed version was better, that Schell had at least one body language to underline what he is saying - nothing. So the scenery ... the minimalist design is not everyone's taste, but I usually like it when there's just enough on stage to make it clear what the setting is and nothing more. This is on a stage, in a theater. It will not work on a piece-based movie that actually has trusted settings. That the idea of ​​the set was copied from the theatrical production in which Schell played the Hamlet ... let's just say it was the only thing to complain about ... I wonder how Schell got to play the role of Hamlet anywhere in the first. place and how one could allow him to play Hamlet for the second time. If you have the option of viewing any of the sixty or so Hamlet-based movies, do not watch this one unless you're a masochist, or really hardcore, or who likes to mock untalented actors.
