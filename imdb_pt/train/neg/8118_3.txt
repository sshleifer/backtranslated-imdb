Well, EYEboy, I must say I do not like it when someone picks on me and tries to make fun of me, especially when it's someone who looks as smart as you. My favorite part of his post was "But it's not a good guy bad-bang bang-bang bad-guy here, kimosabe. I suggest you stick with film with a lot of bang bang." Well said! I like action movies, especially if they are well made, but I also like movies that do not have much action, as long as they are well made. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies does not fit into that category and it's just a really bad movie. I do not really see many non-American films, so maybe I was spoiled and did not realize how bad the foreign films were when I saw Secrets and Lies. Maybe, if I judge foreign films with a different standard, I might someday see how Secrets and Lies could be one of IMDB's best rated films. Hmm ... If it's true, this is very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
