It did not take long to see why Code Name: Diamond Head did not enter network times. The TV pilot's film does not outweigh the credits before it's obvious how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something because the plot did not make much sense. Based on what I came out of the confusing confusion, a terrorist or thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. The world's dullest secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), wants to stop him. There may have been more, but do you trust me? It really does not matter anyway. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. Moments of suspense must have suspense. And dramatic moments should have drama. There is none of this in Code Name: Diamond Head. Have I seen others use the word "turgid" to describe this made for TV snoozer? and it's better than any word I can describe. None of the characters are either exciting or worth worrying about. And Roy Thinnes makes the worst clues imaginable. His charisma is only slightly north of a slug. Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie has for him, but unfortunately for everyone involved, it does not look like he would return as a regular cast member. Now, if McShane had been cast for the cast of the series, well, then you could have had something. <br /> <br /> I'm quickly discovering that these movies made for TV make great episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000.. And that's worth double if Quinn Martin is involved. Very funny things about Mike and the Bots. So while I can only give the movie a 3/10, I cite the episode # 608 to 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
