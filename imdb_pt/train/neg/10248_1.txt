end of the world looks like a good movie on the cover of the box, but be warned that it's bad. Being a big fan of the star's mega-star, Christopher Lee, I was cheated. like tentacles (77), a good cast does not mean it will be a good movie. The beginning seems promising, but it turns into boredom; many parts of the film are too dark to see what is happening. The rest of the cast is shown. briefly as: Lew ayres, Rector Jagger, and MacDonald Carey as security guard. I would have expected better from the band Charles who made good fun movies like the re-animator and the dolls. I heard Christopher Lee was fooled into making this movie. said his stars would be Jose Ferrer, John Carridine and Jagger. Well, Dean Jagger's there, but the other two never did. If you make a film about the end of the world, use a bigger budget and better storyline. Jagger went on to make two good movies later, Alligator (80) and Death Game (79) renders Lyon (Lolita) your lollipop. if you are a glutton for punishment, then watch the end of the world I dare you to say awake throughout the film.
