Quite typical for Swedish films of this type. Strange that the acting was soooo bad, these actors usually give a good show. The cast was poorly made, made you expect something (I will not tell you what). The main character was horrible ... I do not know where they find her. Anyway, stay away from that and go see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" instead, this is the Swedish action on is cousin.
