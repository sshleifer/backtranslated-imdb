Since I'm from Hungary, I've heard many people say better and better about Üvegtigris so far, but I do not really understand the reason for all the fuss. <br /> <br /> I liked many points of the film, Some of the quotes really cheered me up, but the stereotyped characters are present again, as in all Hungarian films, and the story is also boring. I liked the first half but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole movie just annoying. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is good as ever, Reviczky is brilliant too, but the others are there ... doing nothing. <br /> <br /> How many years still have to go through a good Hungarian film ???
