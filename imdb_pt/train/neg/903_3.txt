1937's Stella Dallas with Barbara Stanwyck did not age exactly right - as someone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzle. Perhaps they thought that Bette Midler, cheerful and daring resourcefulness, could do something about it, but this old script defeated her. Plotting about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock, and years later giving the young woman the rich dad of the child so that she has a chance to have a better life can not escape outdated traps and feelings. Midler works best with a film director who can control his excesses, but that does not happen here; Stephen Collins is impassive as the man who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado succeeds as Midler's daughter. This is what used to be called a "portrait of a woman", a wallow, but it is not valid because it remains true to the origins of 1930. * 1/2 ****
