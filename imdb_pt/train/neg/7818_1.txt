I usually do not leave a movie, but in the middle of the way I did. This movie promised something different, but I kept thinking I have not seen this before? Spoiler alert! Back to 1, the spacecraft crashes and lands on the ground, well, all those years later, with a super adult on board no less, this thing still manages to burn and crash! What, this advanced civilization does not seem to be able to develop the landing gear? For an industry that is so liberal, we get to see another Woody Allen movie, no blacks please! The superman walks around saving people, making sure he sticks to Europe and the US, do not go in obscure areas, please. Maybe I could handle this 30 years ago, but right now.
