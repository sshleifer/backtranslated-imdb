Based on the dubious bestseller Ray Russell, this bust of John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) directed by Hough has little in its favor. <br /> <br /> Although there is no lack of bloody violence, it lacks narrative sensibility and "characters". The title "Incubus" is a demon with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into the vagina during intercourse - or, to be more precise, rape. <br /> <br /> John Cassavetes, deluded by his successful career as a director, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women. <br /> <br /> The horrible possibilities of the victims that generate demonic offspring are not considered - and none of them is the tolerance of the public for the slow moving trash. The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this insipid Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise.
