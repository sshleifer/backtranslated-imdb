(1 out of 5 stars) Horrible and horrible movie ... based on the pulper / paperback magazine by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a superhero hero of adventure in the 30's and its five assistants, all specialists in some field of action that allows them to fight evil. It was a very corny series ... but kind of fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a film version in the '70s, starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never got a chance to see it. Never played in the theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I've finally seen the movie, I can understand why. The plot and the characters are never treated seriously ... it's kind of ironic and flamboyant ... kind of like the old Batman TV series ... only without the benefit of being funny ... or having any visual sun . Corny's dialogue, special cheese effects, stupid stereotypes, crummy and bad acting scenes, poor performance. In fact, I find it fascinating in their evilness ... what could they be thinking? There are rumors that Arnold Schwarzenegger would be starring in a modern remake ... but I do not imagine that was much better.
