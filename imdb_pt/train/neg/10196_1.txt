As a poker enthusiast, I was eager to see this movie - especially since it had Scotty Nyugen. <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Nyugens is the only place for that. <BR> The characters are unpleasant and annoying, the soundtrack is horrible and the plot, well, there is not one. <br /> <br /> I honestly had a headache and caught myself reading the bar code number in the DVD Box after twenty minutes I was bored. It's really ashamed that Nyugen was in this movie, otherwise I would not have wasted $ 16 buying Ebay. <br /> <br /> Take it off me - avoid like 7 2 offsuit !!! Dire :(
