Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (with the strength of films of class like "Sling Blade", "A simple plan" and "The man who was not there", among others), it was inevitable that there were it would be the weird turkey inside. What I did not realize, though, was that there could be such a bad thing. I'll give you an idea of ​​how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue is: "Knock Knock," "Who's There?", "The Big Smelly Man", "The Big Smelly Man Who?", The Great Smelly Man - It's YOU! " Yes folks, it really is that bad. Billy Bob is only there for two minutes (I think he needed the work back then), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason, although it is undeniably horrible, I do not hate it. That's probably because I save my wrath for any high budget, special effects like "The Fast and the Furious" and not a "budgetless" movie like this. 2/10 in a jerk.
