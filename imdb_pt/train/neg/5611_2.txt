I personally found this film horrible, first hardly objective, and provided one side of the debate. The only people who were presented as the side saying he existed were a lot of people coming from a Billy Grahm Revival. Second, he veered heavily from his supposed topic, Jesus (Yeshua) existed, to talk about how violent Christianity is, and showing scenes of Mel Gibson, "The Passion." In the end, the director with his former director of a conservative private school was interviewed and tries to arrest him about teaching the children there the faith. Oh, and also Techno Music just made the movie harder to watch.
