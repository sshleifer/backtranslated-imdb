I had to write a review of this movie after reading another comment saying that this is the best Sidney Poitier movie. Poitier had just returned from more than a decade of acting at the movies and he is clearly shocking here. 11 of your movies are mentioned on Wikipedia and do not include that. Five of his films are on AFI's list of the 100 most inspiring films, again, not including that. Berenger and Poitier, the rube and the city, sought to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before crossing the border into Canada. Some of the comedy attempts in this film clearly failed, and Berenger and Poitier's bond was noteworthy and awkward (not helped by a completely bland script). Kirstie Alley (as hostage) was underused and almost totally ignored when she was on the screen. Some suspense attempt is made, for example, when you are meant to guess which of the 5 men on a fishing trip is the killer (they are all cast type villains). I understand that this is the whole call to most of the fans out there. I guessed who it was and I was not really trying. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Berenger, watch the Sniper (1993), you can even see Billy Zane exhibiting. It is much better. All in all, I'd give Shoot to Kill 3/10. It's not daring, and it's too simple for me.
