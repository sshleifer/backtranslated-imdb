Quirky, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - all these are teasers that have left me eager to spend an hour or more "discovering" a movie gem. Boy, was I disappointed. Julian Po never got over it. The film is relentlessly self-conscious. I found myself unable to suspend disbelief for a moment. The exaggeration, obviously theatrical scenarios, the exaggeration, obviously theatrical performance, the exaggeration, obviously theatrical direction - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style. And it's hard to feel much about Julian Po because we never know much about him. The ridiculous girlfriend, the annoying locals, the stupid clergyman, the spoiled brats - why would someone, particularly someone with a long-standing ambition to get to the beach (Slater's character) decide to stay in such a gloomy place?
