By now you should know about this movie, the "bomb" of Jessica Simpson that practically went straight to the video (limited, anemic, theatrical). Basically, Mrs. Simpson's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman. She's stranded, but there's a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I'd like to see more often in the movie), who lets her stay. Katie ends up getting a job through two conniving co-workers (Penelope Ann Miller and the always fun Andy Dick) who are using Katie to take out the company's CEO (Larry Miller). This is strictly a movie b, it is not to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress, but she is very beautiful and never really annoying. The film is watchable in that it is not an abomination, but its disposable fluff. At one end, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle joke about Milwaukee made me laugh), and there's a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (do not read too much about it). So not horrible, but easy to jump. Your safe bet is to watch on television if that happens. Again, not good, but not a deep disaster.
