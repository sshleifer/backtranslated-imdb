I can not believe how uncultured this movie is. It's like attending a police academy, except it's with people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot who should be a helper. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but that is just complete stupidity. Not only is there no plot for this movie. It's like watching someone who pretends to be a doctor, throwing non-medical words around them, as if they were team leaders at a major medical center. Also, people are wearing clothes that are unfit for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a movie of valley girls "b" in space.
