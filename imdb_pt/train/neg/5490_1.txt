When I was a kid, we used to be babysitters, and we used to rent a movie or watch a movie at the movies. This is one of the movies we watched. This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, I think it might even be a Walt Disney Pictures movie! A Martian is thrown on land, becomes human, befriends a human and is trying everything to return home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors, Christopher Lloyd from Back to the Future as the Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But otherwise it sucks. Poor!
