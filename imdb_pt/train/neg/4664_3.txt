I voted 3 for this movie because it looks great as does all Greenaways output. However, it was his usual mix of "artistic" sex and pretentious crap. I know a lot of people like this movie, but I got tired of it fast. Definitely not for everyone. The omnipresent McGregor obviously accepted the paper by credibility, I think, but he really should not have wasted his time. I hate consigning someone to the corner of the pseudologist, but please ..... !!! On the plus side it is visually very attractive and I liked the music but could not see until the end and can not say that for many movies. I usually watch the whole thing, but this is unbearable!
