I saw this loss of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I innocently and obviously assumed it was a comedy. But there's absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script I might have written with my left ass - after having been beaten senseless by the torturers of the 15th century Inquisition. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the tastiest and tasteless dialogues I've seen in a while, and zero commas to speak. Just the fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this movie has less than 1000 votes on this site, it should tell you everything. A couple of scenes of waves crashing on the cold British coast, but that's about it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of film that is made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and / or lots of money out there.
