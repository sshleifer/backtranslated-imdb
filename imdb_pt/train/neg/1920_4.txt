I'm not saying that Night of the Twisters was awful, but it was far from great. Mediocre in the absolute best. It seems, however, that every time a type of movie is released, a second must be about the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Night of the Twisters is actually only Twister, except worse and with mundane special effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the actors who starred, even if they were not great, it was the film itself, the direction, the special effects, the whole plot was too strange to interpret. A series of tornados hits a city and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and dealing with the damage. <br /> <br /> I do not really know why it looks like duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other, but this would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
