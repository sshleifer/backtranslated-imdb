This may be the worst show I've ever seen. Apart from the lack of taste of having a sitcom about Hitler, it's simply not fun or funny anyway. It's very similar to a 1950s sitcom in its cornball mood and invented situations, but although it can be well done as in I Love Lucy, it's not funny here. I think the show was based around the novelty "look, it's Hitler as a cheater sitcom figure," but it just fell out of sight in all respects. The guy who plays Hitler is so strong it's hard to be alone. I wonder what could have made the network think it was a good idea to go on the air. I thought America had some bad taste show, but the British beat us this time. America would never air a sitcom about Hitler, although we had that program on Lincoln's slave, The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. You will probably never see this show, since it only aired on one episode and will probably never be released on DVD.
