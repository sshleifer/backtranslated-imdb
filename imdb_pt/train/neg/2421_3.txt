with this attempt by the ABC family of box office success "cheaper by the dozen" comes a detestable amount of tacky dialogue, surface plot lines and cheese returns. With about two good actors among many who want to be, this movie was a big disappointment. It is an aspiring Hollywood idem of an already bad plot. So, because they needed so many actors, that meant they would probably be more tolerant. So the performance was not five stars. The plot moved quite fast, and the plot was bad and had a horrible timing. The joining of characters and the "final relationships" were also too soft and clich√© for me. Save yourself and rent something better.
