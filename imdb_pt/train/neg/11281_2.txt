I have given this movie a high rating of 2 stars, as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the movie .... the road bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the film offered me the immortal line - "50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk", but I felt that my Polish colleague could speak in a Russian accent more convincing than I could, so I refused to accept that . speaking in part. I was a bit shocked because this was my first cinematic experience ... and who knows ... these lines could have ended with phrases like "I'll Be Back" and "Francely My Dear, I Do not Care". If I had spoken that line, my name would appear on Rancid Aluminum's credits as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. As time goes on, I'm telling you that my name is not connected to this movie. <br /> <br /> Even though I spent a whole day on the set, South Island, Barry Island, no one could tell me what the real story was. The wait staff and the wardrobe agreed that there seemed to be a lot of swearing and nudity ... things certainly could have been worse had I ended up naked in this most terrible movie ... Still ... On the positive side ... I talked to Rhys Ifans during a break. I had no idea who he was, since "Notting Hill" was yet to be released, and not a hint that he might be Welsh. I made several inappropriate comments about what a terrible Island Barry Island has become since my childhood in the 70's and 80's. It was only when Keith Allen appeared that I realized I was in a quality production ........
