I got out of very few movies before they finished, but I could not finish this piece of crap. This was the biggest burden of racism trying to pass as a legitimate film since "Birth of a Nation." The characters were little more than cardboard cutouts. I do not see how any actor would like his name to be associated with that movie. Lee must have better things to do, put garbage like that. I know that I and anyone with a brain has better things to do ... how to watch paint dry. I wish someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically. There is much more depth to this subject, the superficial speech of a bitter director like Lee.
