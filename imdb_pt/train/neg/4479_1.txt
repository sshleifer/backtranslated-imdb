I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies of all time. If not then it is very close. I've seen a bad teen novel. Well, that's like one of those. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLY SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> dude: all we need is here. <br /> <br /> girl: but I want to take me somewhere different. I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Continuing this line they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've read the book, avoid this movie like the plague. They completely change the characters' personalities and events. Plus, they just get rid of things. Also, the movie ends before the book is finished. It's a horrible movie. So, if you have not read the book, do not watch it. If you read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like stupid teen soap operas that are of lower quality than your average teen quality novel, go for it. So, again, should we expect anything other than MTV?
