I'm happy to have rented this movie for a reason: its shortcomings made me want to read Allende's book and read the full story. <br /> <br /> Pros: the movie is beautiful, the period is well represented and consistently (as far as I know), and Meryl and Glenn do good work. <br /> <br /> Cons: It's the worst acting job I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I wondered if anything was wrong with his mouth. (And I hate the terribly English way he says "Transit.") Winona Ryder does not believe in anything except looking young and idealistic. Most of the other presentations are good, but few things are together in character arcs and developing relationships that I was frustrated and angry well before the end. <br /> <br /> I am very curious now if this movie is typical of Bille August's work. I may have to spend a few more dollars to rent Smilla's Snowhead.
