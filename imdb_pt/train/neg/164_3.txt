I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I was looking forward to it. I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise, its tight underwater style and rough edge technology compared to the days we are accustomed to. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything so interesting in this pilot. I thought the plot was complicated and confusing. <br /> <br /> I admit that I liked some of the characteristics of character development - the depictions of humans as a "teenage" species ready to get over their pants were fun. <br /> <br /> And that vulcan cat had a hell of an incredible mess. <br /> <br /> But I do not think I'm going to get hooked on this series. <br /> 3/10
