I know, I know, "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the worst movie, or maybe "Hands, the Hands of Destiny." But I can not worry about these sock monkey movies. Of course they are bad. How could they be good? But if you're talking about films with respectable production values ​​and profitable talent, the T. rex of all turkeys has to be "Yentl". All the arrogance, all selfish intransigence, which smears everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its climax in this film. From his lonely peak of horror, "Yentl" looks at "A Star is Born" and advances to "The Mirror Has Two Faces". There is nothing more like this. What emotional current dragged Streisand to make this movie that I would rather not speculate, and what audience she was playing, I can not imagine, though I bet there are nine in ten chances that you will not be a member of it. The Nobel Prize winner and holy guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so indignant with what Streisand did with his story that he publicly criticized it for it. It is a tribute to the impenetrable vulgarity of Streisand that she not only did not commit suicide, but also made films more terrible.
