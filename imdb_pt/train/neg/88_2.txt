I longed for this movie. It's a good family movie; however, if the editing team of Michael Landon Jr. did a better editing job, the film would be much better. Many scenes out of context. I hope there is another movie in the series, they are all very good. But if another is done, I ask them to take better care of the issue. This story was all over the place and did not seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other films in the series were great. I like the story of Willie and Missy; Both are great models. In addition, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoys a good love story.
