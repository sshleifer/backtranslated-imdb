I read some exciting comments here on IMDb and thought I'd take a look at this movie. Disappointed. On the plus side, male leads are good, and some interesting photos, but as a whole this movie can not convince. It seems to be full of its self-indulgent importance in trying to say something significant, but falls far short of it and, in spite of everything, the image is an unconvincing mess. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies rated as a movie. noir that can be defined as follows: "A film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, threat and cynical characters." <br /> <br /> Well, here's the story: 3 losers stumble over each other with their collective problems that include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, debt, etc. and together they conspire to kidnap a child and deceive one another . It would have been a much better film if the story had been confined more to kidnapping than to the character flaws of the kidnappers. I thought the female protagonist was out of her depth and I came across an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> Although some good times, I ended up feeling that I had wasted my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
