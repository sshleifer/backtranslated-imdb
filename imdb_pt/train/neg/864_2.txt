Even though there is a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often named as the best film by Jess Franco. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang tells "Succubus" among his personal favorites. So maybe it's me, but I thought this was a terribly annoying and overly confusing movie. The opening is great, however, and shows Janine Reynaud doing an act of SM on stage. It's all from here, unfortunately. Reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills his lovers in some kind of trance. Franco had a decent budget to work with and spends well on nice places, beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical trail. This could have been his biggest movie, if it was not for the lame and uninteresting story. It's supposedly psychedelic, but I would say sophomoric is a better term to describe what is shown here. Half the time, you have no idea what's going on or what exactly is said, so even the short 80-minute duration seems to last a long time. This is certainly not Franco's best film, according to me. I would not even recommend this to fanatical exploration fans. If you're looking for a top film by Jess Franco, try to get your hands on 'Las Vampiras', 'The Terrible Dr. Orloff' or 'Vampire Female'.
