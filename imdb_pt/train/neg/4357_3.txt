A group of friends comes face to face with a family of hideous cannibals while camping in the beautiful German countryside. The concept of the 'mutant cannibal family' is almost as old as the hills that innate aberrations often call home, so any director who tries to give a new life to the genre needs to come up with something very special. impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give the well-worn routine a Teutonic touch, transplanting the action into the Black Forest and giving her the low-budget German treatment. The result is a very bloody effort, but totally unoriginal, which becomes almost impossible to correct due to some poor management decisions - in particular, the uninterrupted use of sophisticated filters and annoying editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Timo Timo Rose did not choose to use all the tricks that his editing software offered him, so Barricade could have been a reasonably entertaining blood festival: his inexperienced cast does reasonably well; the bloody effects are suitably agitated in the stomach; and there are one or two scares and even some well-thought-out creepy moments. All of this, however, is completely ruined by the awful camera work, the unstable editing, and the overwhelming barrage of visual tricks used to give the film the distressed appearance that is so inexplicably popular with today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for strange blood, which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid, loads of unpleasant wounds caused by a variety of sharp implements, and quite a few shotgun damage decent.
