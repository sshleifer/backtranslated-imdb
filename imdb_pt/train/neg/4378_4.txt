Given the title and the art of the strange box, I was ready for just about anything. Maybe my expectation has been forced just a little bit high because I got a little dry. A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie ends up in a strange house when they get lost in the fog and deciding the best way to spend the night is to have sex. Where was this setting not used before? The difference here is the perverse nature of sex. It is not allowed to show all merchandise (groin photos were illegal in Japan for a long time, which is shown is blurry). The movie tries to show the viewer how unnatural sex is. In the midst of all idiocy, a mud monster (whose origin I can not understand) appears and begins to kill the men and rape the women ... then murder them too. Some of the views are a little too much, most notably a woman having her bowels pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting a lot of ... stuff, but otherwise blood is a pretty normal fare. <br /> Ultimately, the film is pulled down by its own projects; is too exaggerated to be a horror image and too horrible to work like a sex movie. Mediums can work, but balance is needed. <br /> <br /> 4/10
