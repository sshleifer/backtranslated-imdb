What was she thinking? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who joins a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime involving a madman who wants to start another ice age. The direct strangeness is something embarrassing and ridiculous, a high concept in search of oneself. Apparently, this was a labor of love for screenwriter and director Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); unfortunately, the end results are anemic, to be charitable. The mere presence of Goldberg on the screen can arouse goodwill and laughter, no matter how poor the script is, but here it is drowning and you can see the bland results. NO STARS of ****
