This is a seriously disturbed movie. Even if the boys deserved something of what they had ... the sadistic, gruesome executions were "slightly" exaggerated. The only character who showed some awareness at the beginning of the hunt was killed before he could offer any help for the sad plot. At the beginning of the film, there seemed to be some promise of a mediocre affair, but that was just a maneuver to woo viewers into a false sense of security before the joy of what was to come. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if Jack Nicholson jumped out of the bushes and shouted "and where's Batman?". Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /> <br /> Now that would have been cool!
