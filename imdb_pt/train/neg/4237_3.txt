JUDAAI was a daring film by Raj Kanwar in his day In 1997, when that topic was out of the box <br /> <br /> To give him his credit, he was able to show how greed changes a person and to what extent person can go to get what he wants <br /> <br /> The movie, however, is damn melodramatic, many ridiculous places <br /> <br /> One wonders why Anil does not buy a TV for his wife ? when he earns so much Just to show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> The turnaround is well treated, but the treatment is straight from the '80s The comedy Johny-Paresh that amuses here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it does not fit the story <br /> < Raj Kanwar's direction is adequate, though sometimes melodramatic The music is good but most of the songs seem forced <br /> <br /> Anil makes his part well Sridevi is excellent on his part Urmila is decent Between the moments of rest Kader Khan is as always Johny Lever is funny, Paresh annoys Farida is decent
