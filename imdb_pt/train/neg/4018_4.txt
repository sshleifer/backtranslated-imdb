This movie is very skeletal. It's a reasonably low budget film (I hope!), Which justifies it a bit, but the lack of a decent cast and a plot prove to be a lot. Phillips is quite believable in his role as a spoiled son of a wealthy family who is looking for himself (though his family is ... er ... well, a little too white ...), but the rest of the cast is picking up straws. Each moment that has potential is ruined by excess melodrama, and there are many sub-tangles (which is an obvious sign of lack of plot. They needed filling ...) I would not recommend this movie to anyone not a hard fan -core of Phillips, or who has absolutely nothing to do. 4/10
