From the time Europe began fighting World War II until the end of the war, Hollywood (with significant government stimulus) made tons of films designed to recruit young men into the Army, making a man's life. recruit looks "cool". This is by far the most careless, implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work, you get the best food, and you lie all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I'm too young to have participated in World War II, but I think there was more to it. There is the story of a plot and a lot of musical numbers featuring some of the main acts of the day. <br /> <br /> I think that in 1943, even the most naive of civilians knew that there was more abroad than the crazy hijinks portrayed in this film. Although I am sure it was to be seen as escapist entertainment, I can not help wondering whether the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war were amused or repudiated this trivialization of the sacrifice of their loved ones.
