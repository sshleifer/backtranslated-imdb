Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of the type. Except for prey, of course. They are dark and bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. Through their charms (namely, a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively), they seduce the desperate souls that they come to torment and victimize. This is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> It's not a mixture of black humor that I can easily sign, in part because it bothers me to imagine the audience cheering for the despicable, main character. I liked, however, the sound and the tune of the quick (and supposedly very witty) comments. I was very impressed by the strong performance of the cast, particularly with David Thelis; only Jeremy's character seemed very two-dimensional. Photography and music, dramatic and sombre, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What really discourages me about "Naked" (and the main reason I would never recommend it to anyone) is the way it seems to present misogyny repeatedly as a valid way of venting anguish . In other words, in a world that is so bad, what difference does it make if someone inflicts some pain on the girls, right? Suggest (as some have in this site) that Johnny is not such a ruthless person because he's not as rude to girls as Jeremy, it seems completely absurd to me. Both are terrible and unpleasant people. And they are particularly interested in hurting women every time they get a chance. It could be argued that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly came back and bit him on the butt. But still, the sadistic behavior of Jeremy and Jeremy is treated to some extent as a matter of laughter. And I may be wrong, but I do believe most people who love this movie also find that aspect of the movie somberly comic.
