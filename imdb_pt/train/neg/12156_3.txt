Jesus Christ, I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I just watched because I got a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost got me out of it. This is absolutely awful! I could have watched Survivor Series 93 on this. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of this was so insipid and generic. I would love it if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger drove his butt through a glass window. I was furious every time he said "lake" and "hut." I would kick his ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. A true angel But she could not even save that complete joke from a movie. Unfortunately, she could not even act like she was crazy when she took the damn truth. It sounded hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also loved the part where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. It reminded me of a time when ... let it go. <br /> <br /> Anayways, watch this movie because of your horror.
