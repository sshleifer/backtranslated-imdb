This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" easily managed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor ... repeats the same situation over and over again. Does not show character development. It does not even show any violent and / or sexual content, and adds nothing new to the psycho-killer subgenre. So lame should be shown in film schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first film. <br /> <br /> BTW where the hell is the "talent"? there are scenes that were filmed almost identically; There are scenes that have two or more master shots and it is very awful to see the action jump from one master shot to another without a reason. The camera hardly ever moves, as if the "very talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. Actors who perform the main functions act as amateurs, and the supporting cast is hardly believable. There are more holes than storyline in the script (if there was one) ... <br /> <br /> A really disheartening movie and a talented director.
