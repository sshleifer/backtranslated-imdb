This movie is so incredibly bad that I almost felt nauseous watching. Up to this point, the other plots had at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was suspenseful and bloody. Part 2 was out of rhythm and fun. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 had good music, good special effects and a fun new Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen before. Alice, a much prettier blonde, from Part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan. In parts, this supposed Elm Street movie turns into a daytime soap. The new characters look tough, and even that sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this. He looks tired and does not seem to be so horrible. Their one-liners seem out of place and different, where, as in Part 4, they can be quite funny. The story of Leslie Bohem never leaves the paper and the direction of Stephen Hopkins is so bad that makes my grandmother to be well! The whole plot of this film is ridiculous and unrealistic. It is also confusing and very stupid. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!
