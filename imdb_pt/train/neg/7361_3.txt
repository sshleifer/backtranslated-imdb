Mr. Perlman gives a prominent performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to struggle with a written script and some nonsensical pieces. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode, with singlet and protruding muscles, I'm sure he could do better, but he seems satisfied. make a grimace and growl through your part. <br /> <br /> The lovely Erika is very decorative (even if fully dressed!) and shows some signs of "getting" to act finally. <br /> <br /> SFX are mostly poor CGI and steals from other movies. <br /> <br /> The shootings are pitiful - worthy of the A-Team <br /> <br /> Nor worth seeing for Perlman - AVOID
