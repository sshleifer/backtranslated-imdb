This film is by no means entertainment, but rather a deeper view of the depths of the darker side of human behavior. Vaguely linking half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravity, perverted sex, greed, violence, and intolerance. All the action happens during some very hot and sticky days during a heat wave in Vienna and the heat is perhaps responsible for some of the anger and hatred in the film. For me, the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment vendor was the worst episode, followed closely by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the "slag" apartment. You will be grabbed and I hope horrified by this movie. I hated it, but I felt compelled to see it. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 to display 'man' as he sometimes is.
