Considered by many critics as one of the greatest critics of all time (certainly the biggest obstacle in the career of director Brian De Palma). <br /> <br /> Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a smug rich kid whose life falls apart. when he and his mistress Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. His story is told by another presumptuous guy, the reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, like I said in my resume ... <br /> <br /> How should this movie be? be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it certainly does not contribute much. It is undermined by unimaginable, repulsive, and one-dimensional characters that you would never want to have the dislike of knowing in real life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started to read it once, but I could not finish because it was not to my liking), but it's obvious to me that those who really liked the novel consider this movie a complete farce. <br /> <br /> I have never seen so many talented actors strive to give a below average movie some quality looks and fail. What a waste. <br /> <br /> The problems begin with the presentation of the nice Tom Hanks in a role that clearly should be unfriendly. And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Briton. Bruce Willis is evil, BADLY missed the part. What was the thought there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact, being forced to make a lame and heavy talk about 'decency' after the climax. <BR> <BR> This film ends up turning into an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I liked talent management; for that, I'll give you four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say that a MUCH better film could have been made from the source material.
