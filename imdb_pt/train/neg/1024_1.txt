I saw this movie at the Toronto festival with fairly solid expectations. the film has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it should be good, right? How wrong I was. I knew we were in trouble when, before the movie, the director talked about when he was directing an episode of wiseguy, he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director / writer of wiseguy making his Edison's director / writer must have some incriminating photos of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because I can not see how he (along with the other actors in the movie) would ever agree in being in this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely terrible! It's a mixture of all the boiled police cliches. There is nothing new with Edison. the performance was poor and the direction was even worse. It looked like that episode of wiseguy. This was the best straight-to-video movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Some examples of silly bad times in Edison ... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to play rock and roll ... justin timberlake getting creative critiques of his life while his apartment is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird ... 3 guys being shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> this movie is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM EDISON!
