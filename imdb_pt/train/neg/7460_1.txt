Corky Romano has to be one of the most moving and horrible "comedies" of all time. <br /> <br /> While Chris Kattan, sometimes entertaining, made a very funny performance on the hilarious 'Undercover Brother', his character Corky is so stupid and so embarrassing - which is a pity, since the premise is a wonderful idea. For evil, they ended when they reached page 3 of the script.
