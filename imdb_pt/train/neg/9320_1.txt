If this movie were a comedy, I would have given it a 10. Oh my God, where do I start? Put it this way - I've seen a lot of terrible horror movies, but this makes Troll 2 look like a damn 'Saving Private Ryan'. It's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror movie, change their minds in mid-production and decide to make a comedy, then go back to terror, and then decide that they should have just gotten the softcore. Everything about this movie is simply terrible: the musical score (someone shoots the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), the script, the direction, the cinematography, the acting. There simply are not words to describe it. Oh wait, yes there are: Holy $ *%!.
