I feel like I've been, the con is on, do not fall for it. After reading brilliant reviews (the director has been a film critic with Sky for years, then he must have many friends in the press ready to do him a favor by writing favorable reviews) I expected solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, an intriguing development of entanglements and poetic moments. Unfortunately, 'Sixteen years of Alcohol' does not deliver on the promises of the critics, most of the time, it sacrifices those qualities instead of low-budget special effects (what was that clichéd cobweb scene there?), Fight choreography unrealistic and numbing narration, cliché and camera angles. 'Sixteen years of alcohol' begins interestingly with some beautiful photos in Scotland, but it's a direct descent from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building suspense - the director chooses to start going insane with the self-indulgent, heavy-handed lecture. The main characters are so unfriendly and so misunderstood - the audience does not care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie! To make matters worse, the "honors" (typical of a director trying to pay his debts to past masters) are totally cliché or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me up and kept me in the movies, but even that did not support the dramatic narrative, connecting a period of time to the action. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the film became increasingly flawed. and to be completely honest boring. I still watched the whole thing! <br /> <br /> I think I liked the attempt at brave realism in the movie, but even this was destroyed when they were often intersected with strange and abstract scenes, sometimes meaningless. You do not need a huge budget to make a truly moving film, a lot has been said about how little money they had to make this movie, half a million is not a little money ... So no excuses! Sometimes I wonder what the actors ... or their agents were thinking! <br /> <br /> Pass on this turkey, unless you are masochistic or irrational anyway ... NOT MY MIND <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
