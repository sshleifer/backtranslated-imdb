Painful. Painful is the only word to describe this terrible interpretation of a Shakespearean play so entertaining and interesting. I took a chance, but I was terribly disappointed and could not even finish seeing him. For the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this turnaround of Much Ado was, I pity you and your brain bored. May his pretensions upon the young spectators be raised without retribution. Please do not even bother with this disgusting and disgusting excuse for the performance of an acclaimed Shakespearean drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and you will need a dresser near the television with which you will choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will occur.
