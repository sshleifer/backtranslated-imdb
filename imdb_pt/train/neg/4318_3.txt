I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I have ever seen - the others being THE WIFE OF CHRISTMAS and JACK FROST. All three films are about death. If you like to be completely depressed, then by all means watch this movie or any of the others. In this film, the acting is good and some of the landscapes (separated when people are dying) are lovely. But, I'm worried that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and get involved! Despite a "happily ever after" ending, most of this movie is a terrible disaster after another. And, for some crazy reason, I DO NOT WANT TO BE DEPRESSED when I watch a Christmas movie (I know this sounds crazy - after all, it's not crying out of anger and feeling unhappy about the holiday anyway for a more visual experience invigorating, experience the forgotten HOUSE WITHOUT A CHRISTMAS TREE, CHRISTMAS C. SCOTLAND CHRISTMAS OR CHRISTMAS HISTORY - unless you enjoy being miserable.
