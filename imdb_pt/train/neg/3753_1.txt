Because of the strike of the 1988 Writers Guild of America they had to film this episode in 3 days. It's basically crap, consisting of clipped and clipped clips from Season Two and was described by writer Maurice Hurley as "awful, just awful." <br /> <br /> Why producers could not just wait to film something decent, who knows. I'm guessing that because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release one episode of flashback or maybe Roddenberry was very sick at the time to be able to veto that half-mouth. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in the series.
