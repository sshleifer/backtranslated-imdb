Reading my review of THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, many may assume that I am about 14 years old that I think SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. This is not the case as I am 30 years old and have watched horror movies for most of my life. But admittedly, I'm an eighties kid who grew up in horror movies - so I prefer horror movies that are more graphic and faster. Just like someone who can appreciate different songs, paintings or, in this case, movies - but not necessarily like them - I can understand why some people might enjoy this kind of movie ... I just do not ... SCREAM is an extremely monotonous and boring film about a school for rebellious girls. The heavy school mistress rules with an iron hand (or whip in some cases ...) to keep the girls on the line. She has a child who crawls and stalks the girls while they take a shower (with their sweaters a little (?!?) ...), meanwhile, the girls are disappearing from school, as they are victims of a killer lurking about the campus ... <br /> <br /> I can see why the HOUSE THAT SHOUT is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a masterpiece of a movie in my opinion ...), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so monotonous and monotonous that I could barely stay awake. I'm all for "tension" and "suspense" in horror movies - but this movie was not realized for me. Fortunately, I was not expecting much in this, so I can not say I was very disappointed - THE HOUSE SCREAM only reinforced the fact that I personally do not like most horror films much older than the 70's. is a difficult and quick rule, but those that I have definitely enjoyed seem to be more of an exception. Probably a "must-see" for horror fans who like more subtle and evocative horror movies - but as I really do not know many fans of such material, I can not really recommend it ... 4/10
