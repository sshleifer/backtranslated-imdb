I will not bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there is almost no plot, anyway. I've seen a number of analysts call the ISOYG an "anti-rape" film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to agree with the unreasonable hypocrisy of these claims. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a well-made woman is behind. Whether it was Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely do not believe it to be - is totally irrelevant. The movie is sex marketing and the provocation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (anything but actual penetration is shown) that NOBODY, except the tough exploiting crowd, will like it. <br /> <br /> The rape (s) in the movie is uncomfortable, brutal and difficult to watch. There is something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to last for 30 minutes, none. There was also a small character development of the victim and only one of the rapists was slightly developed (mere moments before being killed), so the scene is by no means involved on an emotional level. Actually, it is only presented to show extreme sexual violence and you can see from the films that ISOYG is associated with IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that attracts only the exploiting crowd. <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviewers praised Zarchi's so-called documentary style and the lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept the rest of the film is (acting, screenplay, etc.), I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because it literally put a camera on and let its grizzled actors do their thing. /> <br /> <br /> I will not raise it all on my high horse talking about the contents of ISOYG. I'm all for exploration / horror video and love nasties. In fact, I'm giving this movie three stars just because it actually does a lot more than some other movies. However, it is also poorly done and after the rape occurs, it's just frankly boring for the rest of the movie, while we witness a lot of murders, mostly murders, and we expect the credits to roll. <br /> <br /> This is probably worth watching once if you are a fan of hardcore exploration of the 70s, but I'm telling you, the movie is generally very bad and not worth it his notorious reputation.
