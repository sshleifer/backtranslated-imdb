*** One in ten stars *** Because, if it was, you get an F. Holy Mother Mary of God was so bad. I mean, I gave him all reasonable accommodations considering it was straight to the video, but that disappointed me at every turn. Like so many other B movies, the basic plot was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It's a shame they attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The basic premise involves some fraternal nannies who host their annual haunted house collection event when a book of satanic spells appears out of nowhere. tosses the boys of fraternity into living hell. Well, that's the idea anyway, but instead, most of the film is dedicated to displaying those boyfriend relationship escapades, filled with a scandalous lesbian subplot. Very little of the real story is devoted to Halloween or the mysterious spell book. It really drives me crazy that the filmmakers thought they could get away with that dribble. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially about relationships with frat boys. This is NOT what the movie is billed as. I am tempted to track down the producers and, at the very least, threaten them with bodily harm. The acting is as bad as it sounds, it's atrocious! The script is unintentionally funny. Cinematography is simply lazy. The whole movie is amateur night. This film really makes SyFy movie productions look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film seemed that the filmmakers realized that they were not producing a soap opera and had to release some kind of film. horror sequences. The evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone into the haunted house in the character they wear. I almost feel like crying as I write this comment. Wow!! I mean wow! This thing was an indecipherable disaster.
