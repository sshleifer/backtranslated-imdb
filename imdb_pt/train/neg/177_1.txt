If you are planning to see this movie, please reconsider. I do not usually post my comments on something I've seen on television, but this was a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth. Criticizing this movie would take a lot of time, as there are so many things wrong with it. I'll just say, please, never see this movie again. It was a complete waste of my time and will be a waste of you. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this film is one of two things; totally inept, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee you will regret seeing this movie!
