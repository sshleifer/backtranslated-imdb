After buying the DVD in a bargain box due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover, I put it on the DVD player and everything looked fine. Nice animated menus and a lot of extra features ... but when I played the movie itself, what a disappointment. It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The commentary that praises the film here on IMDB is actually from the people who made the film. So do not believe it, unless you enjoy wasting your money!
