Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK Buddy Cop Actioneers is one that I do not despise, but very rarely do I see such a banal and ridiculous plot as this was. That would have been forgivable, as it always does in these types of movies, when the stock pays, unfortunately, not. The action bears the trademark of Surrealism and the superior nature of the HK action, but it is not too engaging, obscenely bloody and indeed often quite incoherent (perhaps this is due to the reissue to the American release, it shows signs in many patch sites). I was very disappointed.
