Doppelganger has his moments, but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a mix of psychological thriller pop, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past (most of her family was murdered and she was at least in one case the main suspect), or does she simply have a very bad case of multiple personality? disorder? George Newbern is his new roommate, and most of the action revolves around him. <br /> <br /> Newbern's character is quite nice, and both he and Barrymore do a decent job (though not exactly good). The mediocre script for (sometimes) utterly awful and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion. The character of Leslie Hope is memorable but so annoying that you will want to forget her. <br /> <br /> The plot ends up disintegrating into a bizarre (an arc of history is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) strange climax that is so poorly conceived, represented and photographed that effectively neutralizes most of the value which the film had previously achieved. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film has the feel of what could be the result of M. Knight Shamalyan's first film. undergraduate film class. The acting and screenplay for the two leaders are good enough to make you care a little bit about them - at least until the movie derails completely and completely. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your doppelganger, but avoid a personal first date.
