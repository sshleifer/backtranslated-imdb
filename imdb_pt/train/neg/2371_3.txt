I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that does not mean I do not like Robert Englund and his other films on Nightmare on Elm Street. I think Robert is a great actor. No one plays Freddy Krueger better than he does. But without Robert's offense, this movie sucked. The acting is terrible, the plot is very weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that is worth watching. Sometimes, sequels may be better than the first, like the Friday the 13th franchise (I thought the remake was the best of the series.) But this is not one of those films. The original was good, the second in my opinion was better, the Third it was ok, but I did not, seen the others. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake I did when I saw that piece of junk.
