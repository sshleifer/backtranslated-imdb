This movie should never have been made. Bad animation, in addition to bad acting. I'm not sure at what point the people behind this movie said "Ok, sounds good! Let's do it!" I was amazed at how horrible this movie was. At one point, which may well have been the worst, a computer generated Sabertooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The villain of the film was a paralyzed saber that was killed a few minutes after his first appearance. The other two manage to kill a handful of people before being burned and slaughtered. So there's a random waiting for victims in the jungle ... which scares me for a single reason. Will there be a part two? God, for the sake of humans everywhere, I hope not. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure junk. From the power point, the credits esquire until the end of the slide show.
