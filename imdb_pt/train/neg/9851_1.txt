Even worse than the worst David Lynch "confusaton", "Brain Dead" does not make any sense. Shamelessly wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton) jumps up and down like a cartoon Tom and Jerry in acid. There is an insignificant development of character. He simply begins to climb the "strange scale" until he reaches the climax in total chaos. Do not get sucked into this because of the excellent actors above. They get nothing to work on, and you'll be wondering what's going on for the entire 85 minutes and unbearable. I highly recommend avoiding "Brain Dead" at all costs unless you're spreading your brain in total absurdity. - MERK
