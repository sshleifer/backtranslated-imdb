Please someone stop Ben Stiller from playing in ANY movie. Write the studios, hell, write your local congressman. I have more laughs going to a funeral, so I've been watching any Stiller movie. Jack Black tries to do something about a comedy about the fucking missing dogs, and Christopher Walken, perhaps one of the greatest actors of his generation, simply seems embarrassed to be there. Stiller is his unsightly self, but now, even with someone to get him out, proves that he is overrated as a comedian. No wonder this movie went haywire and was available in dollar theaters after only a few weeks. I warn you, and you must warn your friends, Do not watch this movie, it's just horrible, worse than Gothika (personally, I never thought I'd say that), worse than Plan 9, worse than Ishtar, worse then the golden child . Please, Hollywood, no longer allow Ben Stiller in his films, he is not funny, he is a horrible actor, and he is bringing others down with him. The next movie was rated 1 because there are no negative scores allowed, so while the frame says one, I'll give it a Zero.
