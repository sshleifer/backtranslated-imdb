The cast is well. The script is odd at times, and it takes a while to figure out what the movie's purpose is. I found myself eager to do the dishes. The bit Shehan is a crude statement about the war. I guess we should not notice ... we did. It's a house, you did not do more than kill forty-five minutes. The shower part ... huh? What was that? It literally is that I have a client, "Ok, you can use our shower". To yawn. The angles are trying very hard. There was a set of woods, suddenly gone, because you can see through it, then the next is deep and the animals are dying. In the end, this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions.
