Misleading advertisement ... I saw a commercial for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power that states "From Producer to Scarface and Carlito's Way" LETTER STRAIGHT ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact he was 'editing assistant' of room 'for Scarface. Do not take away the talent of Bergman ... but in my opinion he should have had a little more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate to be blatantly lying. As for the movie, it was bad at best. I think Daddy Puff did a good job. Although, Luis Guzman should be ashamed to work on this film. Overall, this movie did not do a good job filling in the blanks for Carlito's Way. It is obvious that this project was an attempt to make a quick money instead of a good movie.
