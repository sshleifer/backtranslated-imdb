This must be one of the worst Swedish films ever made. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and be shown in theaters recently, in the year 2006. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many sponsored products visible in one and the same movie. It should not be so obvious. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why so many known actors even thought the idea was visible in a movie like that. If I had any respect for some of the actors known in this movie before seeing the movie, now that's for sure. <br /> <br /> I heard there will be a follow-up movie and I can not understand how this is possible.
