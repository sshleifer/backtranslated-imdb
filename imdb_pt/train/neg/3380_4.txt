The Broadway show of Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante has lasted for years, but evidences of his power and charisma are lost in this adaptation of the film, which probably stems from the choice of director (Richard Attenborough, as far as possible from B-way) and actor Michael Douglas, who plays a director-choreographer as a viscous corporate lawyer). The slim story, about an exhaustive audition for a Broadway show that turns into a therapy session for the actor-dancer-singer, is thrust upward over us, with tall, daring talents touching the rafters. Nothing is modulated or subtle, particularly a laughable subtraction about a former dancer returning to the theater and beating heads with old Douglas. The anxious hopefuls are full of promises and sorrows, but their personal anguished stories are a bit embarrassing; this, combined with the slow pace of Attenborough, means disaster, and even the now famous songs can not break the artificial wrap. * 1/2 of ****
