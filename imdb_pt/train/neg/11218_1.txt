This movie is not worth the movie in which it was photographed. The dialog box is flat, clich√©d and used by amateur actors who sound like they are reading a script for the first time. The unstable and unstable film style is a cheap imitation of the visual effects of the "The Ring" style. The characters do not even act like a normal person would. For example, the character who is looking for her twin sister in her house forces her way through the front door, creeps around the house all scared and sobbing and she does not even once call her sister's name to see if she's home . What? You'd think she'd just bury her sister instead of looking for her. Many flashbacks from his childhood. Many unnecessary flashbacks are a typical sign of an amateur director. In fact, it's funny to see the innumerable photos of the woman driving her car down the street, through the driveway, through this corner, here, there, a side view, now a front view. Enough. You'd think you're watching a TV commercial for Solaris! Terrible movie. 0 out of 100. I really feel sorry for anyone who spent money making this movie or watching it.
