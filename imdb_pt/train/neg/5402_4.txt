This movie is so unbelievable; - the whole premise is bunkum; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or not) could fly around and kill how many people the movie says is laughable. The vampire himself would not be out of place in a Bela Lugosi movie. Most of the acting is so wooden that actors should be treated for dry rot. I look forward to the day when someone makes a decent movie from a Steven King novel (with the exception, possibly, of Stand by Me). This film suffers from what most of Stephen King's films do - lack of money used for "special" effects, poor actors, frightening characterization and dialogue. This movie is cheap, tacky and flawed in everything it tries to do.
