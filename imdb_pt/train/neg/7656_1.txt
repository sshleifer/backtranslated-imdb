Alone in The Dark is one of my all time favorite role-playing games. I remember spending whole nights staring at the PC screen, trying to escape from that mansion, and actually scaring me sometimes when monsters came in surprisingly. Now, remember - I'm tired of "computer-generated" movies. I do not remember a single success story in this new genre of Hollywood, although some are fun enough to be watched. And yet, I'm a big fan of the game I could not resist. My reasoning was that if the movie had a plot that resembled that of the game, everything would be fine. <br /> <br /> Dude, those were 90 minutes (that seemed like 300) of my life that I will never go back. If I had the chance, I'd be happy to get them rearranging my sock drawer. This is not even in the category "so bad it's funny". You'd think even Christian Slater had a little more common sense than joining this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. However, if the goal of putting this girl in a starring role is to have a sex scene, - which I fully understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) - I've seen more of her body at press conferences . <br /> <br /> There is no plot to speak. Will not waste your time hurling for you. The credibility of the story sinks below "I did not have sex with Mrs. Lewinski." The acting is just a few steps up from 'Street Fighter', which, incidentally, being one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I highly recommend this. <br /> <br /> Children, I recommend the Videogame. It has much better story, acting and much more emotion. As for the movie, here's a spoiler - it's STINKS! Wait for the porn version.
