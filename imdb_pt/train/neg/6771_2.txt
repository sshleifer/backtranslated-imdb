There's a few uplifting things to say about this, but I can mention Matt Dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worth it. As most racing movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not so smart, we end up with movies like that. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who has surprised both of Bad Girls, has to make better decisions about which roles to take. . Here it can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children will only be mildly entertained because they try to appeal more to adults than to children (although they are still very dumb). Those of the theater I saw showed no real interest after a few minutes. And like a family sports movie, this is awful. The best moments are at the beginning of the scrapyard, creating some feeling and, later, at the car party, creating some tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you should develop it better than here. After a few compelling racing scenes you're in the best part: being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.
