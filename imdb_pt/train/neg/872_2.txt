First of all, I expected the "Caged Heat" to be on the same line as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, was I wrong! By no means is this film the exploration of the '70s, "chix in chains," or "women in prison." Of course, the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison, who wear btw street clothes (quite comic), but NOTHING happens. <br /> <br /> There are no strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the director or doctor in order to try to escape, and none of the detainees leaves. There are two shower scenes, which I suspect are just recycled images, but no fight happens - no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter! In addition to the lack of plot, unconvincing characters, unfriendly and simple, some detainees who manage to escape really return to prison to "release" their fellow prisoners? <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie should have ended with the fugitives going to the sunset ... instead of letting this mess continue! <br /> <br /> I feel cheated.
