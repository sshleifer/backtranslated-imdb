Ever wanted to eat worms? Here's a "documentary" to show you how! Yes ... The boy eats live worms! And that's the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was very well summarized by previous reviewers as quite boring. I totally agree here. The movie just is not going anywhere ... unless you enjoy eating me! This is a movie that is almost impossible to write a spoiler for .... because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Now, on the technical side: They should have given the kid a haircut. Whom he's trying to look like ... Bozo, the clown. It was almost comical ... I almost expected him to become the disheveled dog or something. <br /> <br /> And on top of that; the boy was too stout to look hungry! I should have kept him out of the trash for a few weeks before filming. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie almost put me to sleep. And my kids could only hang on for about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I admit the scenery was very impressive. And if there was a decent story to follow, it could have been a success. It seemed safe enough for the kids to watch: the bears' scenes and the 'eccentric' eyeball were too weak to frighten most children, and the brief 'skinny-dipping' scene did not show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave this one a very generous 3.
