Amateur to the extreme. The work of the camera is especially exaggerated - the operators of documentary cameras do not have to rotate all the time. <br /> <br /> The script is really futile, and the acting is even worse. In addition, the story is disjointed and sinuous - with some holes in logic. At one point, the leader wants to be arrested in order to get accustomed to Al-Quada's operative suspects, and thus get an interview with Osama. I found the story unbelievable as a result of so many flaws. The lead role of "filmmaker" really portrays a boy of stupid and reckless fraternity. The only item of interest, in fact, is that the filmmakers actually filmed the spot. It's really a shame they missed the opportunity to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this crap?
