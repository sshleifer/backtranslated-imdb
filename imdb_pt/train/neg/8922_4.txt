Two old men sitting on a park bench. I really do not have a problem with this scene - The only problem is that it's not a scene, it's the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yup movies no longer have the concept of bass than this. They also do not get boring anymore than that too, but it's worse to come because these two old ones are chalk and cheese. One is Nat Moyer, who is a Yiddish communist, while the other is Midge Carter, a former gold glove champion who is also black. Let me see now, a Jew and a Negro sitting on a park bench doing well. Well, I think it is possible, though unlikely, but if this movie has such a harmless scenario, why play with the Jewish stereotype? Why make them agitated trablista ragistas who make Hebrew oaths? A little ironic that the Jews seen at the beginning of the film are exactly the kind of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT is that it Written for a completely different media than the cinema, is based on a play and shows. Walter Matthau dreams of his role as Nat while this commentator almost slept throughout the movie
