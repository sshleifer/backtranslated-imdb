I rented the English-dubbed version of Lensman, hoping that, as it came from well-known novels, it would have some substance. Although there was evidence of substance in the film, most did not rise above the level of children's cartoons. Maybe the film was a bad adaptation of the book, or lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or maybe even the original novels were light. But for whatever reason, there was not much there. <br /> <br /> I noticed many details that were derivative, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise deficient. Some examples: The opening scenes seemed borrowed from the 2001 "star gate" scene and the Star Wars hyperspace image. The robot in the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". Starts trying to borrow his comic relief style from Star Wars, but luckily (since humor does not work) he gives up on comedy and plays serious. In that sense, it is superior to the Star Wars franchise, which began with a clever sense of humor and eventually deteriorated into Jar-Jar's boring nonsense. <br /> <br /> The agricultural details were apparently made by someone who had never seen a farm. The harvester was driving through the unharvested field, dumping silage into uncollected crops, instead of working from one side to the other, and dumping the silage into rows already picked up or into a truck. Corn (corn) was spilling the grain ramp, but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When it came time for Kim's father to face his fate, there was no dramatic weight. to the scene. This could have been partly the fault of the English-speaking voice actor, but the cartoons also did not show much weight. Kim's reactions to the scene were equally unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, even though they were apparently close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler; his name is not revealed until his death scene.) She seems to promptly forget him. Someone's expression of sympathy shows more feelings than she does. I think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in this case; there is at least one suggestion of feeling in Chris's drawings. <br /> <br /> On several occasions, villains do not carry out their orders. A villainous leader often punishes these failures with miserable deaths. I can not tell if this is taken from Star Wars, or if this comes from an earlier source - possibly Lensman's books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which a spaceship falls. When it sinks toward the ground, parts are separated from the ship. But so many pieces are falling that it should not have anything else by the time it arrives. <br /> <br /> While in most cases Chris looks like a competent and tough space hero, there is a scene in which she screams like an incompetent maiden in danger. Someone strong enough to overcome Henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to shout "help, that got me and I can not reach my gun!" instead of just screaming. <br /> <br /> The character with more personality (almost too often) is D.J. Account. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, D.J. in American Graffiti. I wonder if it is so well expressed in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two planets in the movie exploded. The explosions were not impressive, and they seemed to owe a lot of inspiration to Star Wars. To his credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely different from the primary weapon of the Death Star. The dialogue had a good and interesting explanation for the cause. Many other explosions in the film looked good, but not planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game. Some of the images look like primitive video games, and some Tron influence is also visible. On the other hand, the sound effects are usually quite decent, although this emphasizes the parts with the sound of cheese. The art is also good, especially when it gets away from the computer graphics, which look extravagant. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is history. If a movie tells a good story, you can get away with many production shortfalls. But the plot here was very light. A naive boy tries to help someone in a crippled spaceship and acquires a great power that he does not understand. He and his band of very virtuous comrades fight against a powerful and irredeemably evil enemy. He makes friends, learns about his special power and becomes a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous enough, he can even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way may cause this story to rise above the simple outline, but there is very little more than that in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a children's cartoon. But then, since it seems that the main target audience is older children, it may not need to be anything more than that.
