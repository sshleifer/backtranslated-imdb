I can not recommend this movie as a date film. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of the life lived on a property in South East London is a violent Beckettian account of one of Dante's hell circles, frankly. At the center of it is Ray Winstone, who has done this kind of character before, but never so well. The film starts with him ordering drinks in a pub pub - that's all - and you're already overwhelmed by the frustration, self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the film. It's a masterclass in action. <br /> <br /> Of course the stymied and despossessed need a foil in a drama like this and Winstone is reciprocated by Kathy Burke as his suffering wife, who absorbs and rejects her unbearable behavior. . Charlie Creed-Miles does a capable turn as Billy, son of a fuse-lighting fan, though he must have wondered at times exactly where he would allow himself to enter. Gary Oldman directs the actors closely, maximizing the claustrophobia of his flat board misery. 4/10
