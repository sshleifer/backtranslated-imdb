This movie was absolutely horrible, I even feel uncomfortable calling it movie. It's the typical "mumblecore" movie, with zero plot and a bunch of twisted aimless twos, stumbling trying to "figure things out." I tried giving the mumblecore a chance, but let's face it, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> I'm not out of sync with the cinema, I appreciate the films of Dogme95, Idioterne is one of my favorite movies of all time. So, I do not care if a movie is made cheaply, as long as there is some substance (any). <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is horrible, acting, writing (or was it all improvised?), the direction, but most of all, the camera work was simply a simple and simple nonsense . The camera was never anywhere logical, there was no consistency. I have to admit to being a guy I'd heard that there was nudity in this movie, so I thought to myself, even though it's awful at least there's nudity (yes, I know, I'm an idiot). Well thanks to the low quality camera you can never see anything, and the things you see, trust me - you do not want to see. This movie made me want to vomit on several levels. <br /> <br /> Dialogue made me want to vomit, the camera made me want to vomit, but mostly the idea that this movie was praised by some legitimate critics. Well, now that more than anything makes me want to vomit.
