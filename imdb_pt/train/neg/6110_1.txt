Bo is Jane Parker, whose father has long been an anthropologist (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in Africa studying something or other. She traces him (how?) And he tells her about the stories of the natives of a giant monster whose nocturnal howl can be heard throughout the jungle. It turns out that he is the ape-man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogue in the film), who rescues her from bandits and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time in those agonizing two hours to play naked while a Horny monkey looks and applause. Usually I am very open to varied opinions about any movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Notes: Newsday called it "unbearable," which is the best summary of a word I can think of. The Maltin Movie Guide comments that they almost had to think of a lower rating than the BOMB.)
