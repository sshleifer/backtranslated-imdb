For me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes about Franks's fanatasks when he is traveling with a ladder and when he is sitting in business meetings ... The problem is that when you watch this movie for an hour you you will see the same funny fantasies / situations again and again and again. It is predictable. It's more like a TV story where you can walk away and come back without losing anything. <br /> <br /> I like Felix Herngren like Frank, but that's not enough even when it's a comedy that has to have more variations and some kind of message for your audience ... <br /> <br />
