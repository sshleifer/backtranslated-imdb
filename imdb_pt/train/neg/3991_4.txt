I do not know why Spike Lee made this train movie and tricked poor Stevie Wonder to eternally match his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. I also resent the way he uses swear words as part of the normal prose of professional blacks. The abuse of his power over ethnic cinephiles is a shame. Scenes that seem to be invented out of nowhere and have nothing to do with the theme or subtopics, as if some college student had written it. I particularly detest the ridiculous scene in which the two leaders brawl for no reason, and the cops come and attack Snipes. The exaggerated clues make you feel as if Spike does not respect your viewers or he has no idea what a movie is. The final scene seems to be launched to justify the use of a sledgehammer to tackle a point. This film also supports the myth that all people of culture use the word F in casual conversations. I hope he realizes the rest of his films are in the same group as this one where he's not growing as a filmmaker. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a smart move. He should continue to make documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls. Shock movies do not make an Oscar.
