Note that I gave this star 1 if the option had been given, I would have given this zero. When I put this DVD on my TV and sat on my couch, I was expecting some of the worst movies at their best. I looked this movie up on IMDb and saw it was the worst rated movie so I guess I got it critical of every mistake. But that did not prepare me for the crap I was about to vomit from my television screen. <br /> <br /> The box makes this movie look good at best. DO NOT LET THEM YOU. This movie needs to be banned from all the shelves in the world. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this movie is as if it were pornography, but without sex scenes. The acting (if you can call it that), the "plot" (so many holes must look like Swiss cheese), and the special effects are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm not saying I can make a movie better than that, but I'm thinking about it.
