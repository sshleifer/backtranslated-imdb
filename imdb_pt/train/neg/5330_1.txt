Some here commented that this is the worst Elvis movie ever made. Well, they're only partly right. For me, this is the worst movie ever made! I've never seen anything so rude, insulting and vile, and against human nature as this movie. A real embarrassment for the film industry, this is not so bad, it's good. There is no ridiculous fun to have here, as in some other bad Elvis films like Clambake. This is so rotten to sit through your painful. Pure Garbage. The Native Americans must sue for their clich√© and poor stereotyped treatment here. In fact, maybe ALL Human Beings should sue for the crime and disservice that this movie does to the species as a whole. Grade: F
