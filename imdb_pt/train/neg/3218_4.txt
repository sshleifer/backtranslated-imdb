I found this film an interesting study in cause and effect, but little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate or otherwise) affect the lives of others. The premise of the film is very promising, but I feel it does not deliver on its promise. A lot of time is spent telling the public about chaos theory and very little time actually showing it. As a result, I have never felt the true personality of any of the characters and have never made a good emotional connection with them. At the end of the movie, I had an "eh" attitude about all of them. A stronger direction in the development of the character would have made this movie great, but at the moment, it's just more or less like that.
