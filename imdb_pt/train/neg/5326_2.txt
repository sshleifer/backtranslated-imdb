"Smithereens" is the kind of worthless movie that only pops up among cable channels taking up space as a big-money romance in the public library. A useless stretch of tripe and first effort for mediocre director Seidelman, the film is littered with bad acting, bad sound, poor camera work and poor quality in every aspect of the film. Many better movies never come to the market and why movies like this and never seem to disappear is one of the great mysteries of life. (D-)
