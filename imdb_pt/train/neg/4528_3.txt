This Worldwide was the man's version cheaper than the NWA under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions did in the 1980s at the "Big 3" Stations during the Saturday Morning / Afternoon Wrestling Craze. When Ted Turner got his hands on Crockett's failed version of Nock, he turned it into World Championship Wrestling and began to eliminate all NWA referrals. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were renamed with the WCW logo and off the road to Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida and eventually became nothing more than WCW's Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night recap shows. Worldwide it was officially the last WCW show under Turner to air the weekend of WCW's purchase of Vince McMahon and WWF. Today, the entire NWA World Wide / WCW Video Archive Archive, along with the entire NWA / WCW Video Library, usually sits in the vaults of WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
