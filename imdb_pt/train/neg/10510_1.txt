oh god where to start ...... bad acting ... characters you just do not care ... they are american or british ... they seem to think they are in america because where else is a huge forest in the center of the country ... <br /> <br /> A big fault ... They're driving all night through these woods ... unless they're out and about They'd be in Scotland in the morning ... when the whiny one beats the poor wandering woman more .... <br /> <br /> and they are mobiles do not work .. so what they do ... split clear, make it easier to get caught out. ..then three will look for a house that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two stand back to "care" for the unconscious woman ... then what they do, instead of making her comfortable, I pad my head, I covered her or even move her off the flourishing road They just leave her lying on the hard road As they go and make a fire at 100 yrds away ... and all the time they have a camper van putting it on ... and for the excited angels who supposedly wanted humanity so much that they were expelled from heaven to live between us ... so what do they do? embark on sex with any man they meet? ......... they do not bite big pieces of them and pluck their heads ... I think they're missing the point ... <br /> <They're not wonderful sexually deprived angels of ex-cannabalistic vampires ... and as for Tom Savini saying how beautiful the breath is ... Well, these girls have good bodies, but nothing special on the face. the lead role was much prettier than the so-called irresistible sirens ... Â£ 2.30 movie rubbish from my local library ...
