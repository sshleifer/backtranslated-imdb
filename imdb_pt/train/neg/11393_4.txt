Wow, I can not believe people regard this as a "good" movie. Now, I've seen a lot worse, but there are a lot more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre movie at best. Although the performance was not terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There have been many loose ends that do not appear or are not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters go out as complete cowards. They do not know each other well enough to realize that they do not love the people with whom they are committed. How do we know they are not in love? Because of the absolute lack of remorse that both characters have for leaving their finances. I can think of some more romantic things than the continual flight of commitment these two show. <br /> <br /> The film does not even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will get cold feet and fall each. another likes hot potatoes once a compromise is approaching. This film is really about two people who can not commit to anything, unlike the previous Cusack characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this film was the complete lack of twists, or anything of interest. When the film ended, I felt that they had failed to include a climax in the story, which basically fits into the whole movie: annoying. There is no suspense as to whether the two will end up together, there is no joy when they do, with no consequences for their actions. <br /> <br /> It's sad that people are so blind to the lack of this movie that they simply scold. any criticism with "Everyone is very cynical!". Criticism of this film is not cynicism, simply unbiased examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even with Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these movies, your hearts will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping Faith, Riddler, Rear Window, North by Northwest, or There's Something About Mary (which is a good examination of the idealized novel versus today's society).
