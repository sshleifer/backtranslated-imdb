A film difficult to categorize. I was never giving 110% concentration and hence as simple as the plot appeared I could not say for sure who was doing what between the American FBI characters and what their roles were. Nor could he take the Irwins seriously as movie characters when their lines and scenes were all in the style of one of their shows, not staged. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV. show, with a largely insignificant sub-plot going on, which seemed to disrupt. However, as any Irwin show is worth watching, this movie is well worth it, but not on Christmas Day. Speaking of which, I have better things to do than to be here. <br /> <br /> A high of 4/10
