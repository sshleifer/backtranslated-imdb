I grew up (n. 1965) watching and loving the Thunderbirds. All my classmates at school attended. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Counting from 5 became an art form. I took my kids to see the movie hoping they could glimpse what I loved as a child. That bitterly disappointing. The only high point was the melody of the theme. Not that it could compare to the original score of the Thunderbirds. Fortunately, on Saturday mornings, a television channel still makes reruns of the series that Gerry Anderson and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes was to deliver in his chair of directors, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of film. Nonsense. A CGI remake may be acceptable, but replacing puppets with Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a huge error of judgment.
