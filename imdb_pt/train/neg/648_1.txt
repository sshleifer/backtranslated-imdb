Prom Night: The most important night for any shallow girl made up almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters kept remembering us every ten minutes when some tiny minuscule event happened in their tiny lives. <br /> <br /> There's really no excuse for Prom Night. There's less than nothing original about it and I would have actually given zero or fewer stars, if it were possible in IMDb. The only part of my vision that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. It was much more exciting than what was happening on the screen in front of them. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically a guy making a violent attack. And the thing was, it was not a slightly exciting tumult. Maybe if the guy was remotely scary, instead of Robbie Williams tame and resembling a baseball cap, I might have stood there feeling a little anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than about the color of the movie rug did not contribute to the effect either. And to make things worse, the rest of the characters were equally unidimensional and unconscious. The hotel staff did not seem to notice or care about the fact that one of their maids had disappeared and further evidence that a killer is unrecognizable after shaving. I was incredibly surprised that the stereotypical, moody girl in the blue dress was the only person to realize who he was. She realizes this and then begins to descend the stairs, curl up on a sheet of plastic and then knock down a pile of paint buckets. Good. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was that I have the conviction that the director was trying as hard as he could. He really pushed all the boundaries, not showing any deaths happening. Shocking! And the music did not even begin. It was almost as appropriate as undressing at a funeral. <br /> <br /> I really wanted Dance Night to be a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or not, has any reason to see this movie. Conventional cinema seems to be going down and movies like this worsen the situation. If you feel like seeing this absolutely horrible movie, listen to my appeal. Do not do it. There are better things to spend six pounds. Like a sheet to play ghosts.
