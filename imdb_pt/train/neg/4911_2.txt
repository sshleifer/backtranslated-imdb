First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> I admit my first mistake: I did not realize that this was made for the TV movie. I was "thrown out" by the "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film takes about 40 minutes longer. The direction and continuity were excellent. Most of the time, the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The downside of the movie is that it definitely falls into the "chick flick" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should require an "R" rating. There is no nudity or free sex scenes. In fact, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all guests of the SG-1 series, but this film did nothing to progress their careers as they were all used as supporting actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as he usually is and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I came to respect as an actor during the Millenium series, received no challenge to show her range of skills. The biggest disappointment about the cast was Tracy Pollan. In addition to being a below average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself silencing the TV during her dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the kind of TV shows for life. I would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however. Considering that I did not find anything that could cause censorship, this is a movie that is worth just watching on TV, since nothing will be cut. As a TV movie I would rate this as a 5 out 10. As a feature film with an "R" certification and as a strong cast, I rate it as a 2 out of ten.
