There are no spoilers in this review because everything has already been shown in the movie trailer. I'm trying to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local films but I can not help but support the reaction against this movie. It's slow, boring and almost meaningless. Even the "almost pleasing and believable moments" were immediately undermined by painful clich√©s and poor acting. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, who I usually love, were only passable in this movie. It seemed that the director was trying to make a melodramatic TV soap opera, then got excited and decided to put it on the big screen. Leap years should come with an RA rating (Awful Awful), but that has not changed my faith in local movies. More good films will come as long as more films like these are not made.
