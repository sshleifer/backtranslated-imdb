I could not believe my eyes once I watched this movie. There is no sense in it, be it blood or violence. Unlike other horror movies that had blood and a meaning for it, this movie is just blood, blood and kill one after another. This movie is not interesting, it has no significant plot or plot, nor does it have intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this movie in general is useless. Do not even waste your time on this. It's only an hour or two of senseless violence. There are many bloody scenes that are not scary, but simply revolting. This is probably the worst horror movie I have ever seen of all the horror movies I have ever seen.
