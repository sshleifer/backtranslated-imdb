Normally I would not feel qualified to review something I've only seen half an hour, but I'll make an exception for this. <br /> <br /> Let the dialogue speak for itself! Here are some of the thugs' words: "I smell ... teacher!" <br /> <br /> A bad guy and a bad girl (right after killing 2 cops and stealing a van full of drugs, they're getting hot and heavy) : He - "So, how do you feel by shooting some innocent people?" <br /> <br /> She (purrs) "You sure know how to show a girl a good time ..." A generic boy who ran for his life instead of helping someone, sums up his life and personality in this line - "I AM a GIFT-TWIT!" (That was the version of the US network) My father was right! He left us ... "Boo-hoo. <br /> <br /> (It's not really a looter) The bad guy (on fire) yells "Aargh! Fire!"
