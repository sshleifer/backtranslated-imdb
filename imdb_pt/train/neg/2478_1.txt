This movie is S-L-O-W. He spent most of the film actually waiting for him to 'get started'. The scenario was bleak, the script was bleak, the cinematography was bleak, the plot was bleak, the budget was low (not that low-budget movies are bad, but it had no redeeming features). <br /> <br /> The plot was more consumed by a vengeful hunter, somewhat disturbed than the actual Wendigo, who made a brief appearance at the end of the film. movie. This in itself was disappointing as this 'Wendigo' was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a deer. Everything about the film was uninspiring. <br /> <br /> The boy's parents seemed to be indifferent and sometimes seemed completely separated from his son. If this was bad or bad lettering, I'm not sure, but this just added to my disappointment and my level of annoyance. <br /> <br /> There was no reason to think, nothing to arouse interest. Without any intrigue or cold factor, this movie was so painful that you did not care what happened in the end. <br /> <br /> Wendigo's environment reminds me of the boring film shown at the awards ceremony. the end of 'Mr Bean's Holiday': a film that is artistic and meaningless, trying very hard to be profound and meaningful, but pretending to be pretentious and boring. <br /> <br /> I would never want to see this. again. I only watched until the end in the vain hope that something interesting could happen ... but it did not.
