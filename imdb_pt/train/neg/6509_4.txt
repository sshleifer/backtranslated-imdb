Sean Bean is great, as are photography, places and costumes. However, the plot is a bit confusing and the conclusion flat. The plot was SUBSTANTIALLY altered from Cornwell's novel, and not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better than assisted. Sharpe was very closely attracted here, in contrast to his literary alter ego, who seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as promoted officer of the ranks. I really enjoyed the brief scene in which Sharpe is tripped over by a "real" official, and after a quick pause and piercing look, pushes the surprised and intimidated officer back. He sets the tone for his later tests as a commanding officer. Rating: "4" from "10".
