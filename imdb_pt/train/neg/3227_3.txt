This is a portion of the notorious series of guinea pigs. A short-lived Japanese TV show, which was canceled after a psychopath admitted he was inspired by the murder of a young student in the series. This short of the series is, like all the other films of the series, with practically no history. A group of young men captured a young woman. They tie her up and start torturing her to death during her filming. They beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use a pair of pliers on her, and finally, in a "loving" close, pass a needle through her eye. This is the simplest of all guinea pig movies, and one of the first. It was probably this movie, more than any other, that gave Guinea Pig the rumor of being snuff. They certainly inspired Nicolas Cage's "8 mm" film. These films became quite popular in horror circles. They have progressed to more polished films, but also graphics like "Naked Blood". They probably fill the gap left by the Mondo films, which were lightly cleansed and became reality shows. Not recommended, but it will probably attract those who will see something once, and wonder why, after that, I know I did.
