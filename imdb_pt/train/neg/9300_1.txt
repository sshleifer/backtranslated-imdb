Spoiler Alert Well, I think this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (without the heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very bad (piano and orgue ... come on!). The acting is ... well, there's no acting! <br /> <br /> There's a guy out in the woods looking for his missing wife and having time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a fat toothless clown who can not escape a turtle! <br /> <br /> All cast members are dumb and the director puts all the cliches of horror movies in the film effortlessly. <br /> <br /> The end is by far the most stupid ever made. Think about it: The guy (ken hebert) who has acting ability is almost the same as writing (he is the brain behind this failure) invite a co-worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the weekend and kill them. On Monday morning, he returns to his office as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert tries to make us believe that it is a family affair that goes to the generation (his uncle is the clown killer) <br /> <br /> So of course no police officer will interrogate you after your coworker disappears ... WHATEVER YOU ARE. <br /> <br />
