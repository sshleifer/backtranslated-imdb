I can not stand this show! Has there ever been a redeeming quality, a funny joke or a plot that "did not" make the average viewer want to drown in a bowl of soaked cornflakes? <br /> <br /> The voices. Oh, those horrible, miserable voices. Similar to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty slate, each character is uniquely irritating in his suitability for strident and nasal vocals. Cosmo sounds like a whining mutt, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical megera, and Timmy's dad makes each line sound like a misrepresentation of a game show host (Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street" comes to mind). <br /> <br /> The animation is horrible; even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at the incredibly bad work of art in this show. Each character has farce teeth, or a square head, or a head of three sizes too big for your body. And why do the characters speak each line of wide-eyed and smiling, as if posing for a photo shoot with the president? So there's the fact that all the characters in the series are completely idiots. Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson and Buddy Lembeck of the fame of "Charles in Charge" have characters portrayed as so unrealistic. Usually "unrealistic" is synonymous with "bland," and that is definitely the case here. There has not been so much bullshit based on lack of notion since "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the show (and it's the same every episode, so great spoiler alert here): Timmy wants something with his two "Equivalents", something goes wrong, there is always some reason planned so that he can not immediately reverse course and crave the damage, and then everything ends well at the end. Oh, and on a side note, Timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky, and they continue to employ her at every opportunity. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like a kid show containing the subtle message that you can barely tell about an abusive babysitter is probably not a great idea. <br /> <br /> If you are writing an article and want to cite an example of how far the quality of cartoons has dropped, "The Fairly Odd Parents" has to be a great place to start. An excellent example of television producers throwing together a useless product intended for children with little or no effort, simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it.
