I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in your own way. However, the train accident that was Suzy Parker ruined the whole experience for me. His acting was so shocking that I sat there with my jaw open, not believing in my eyes or ears. I barely got past a remark, THAT's how horrible she is at this. <br /> <br /> Cary? Beautiful and in dramatic good shape. Jayne? Lovely, captivating and obviously having a ball. The support cast does everything right, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its retro and dazzling elegance. <br /> <br /> So you see Suzy Parker trying to speak her lines with an ardor, a sadness, a lack of notion that simply defies belief. Who told this creature that she could act? Oy VEY, people.
