I'm not really sure how to begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad movies, as they are often the most fun. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and inept direction. With the exception of the song (which was better than I expected), this movie had all these qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were incredibly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch include the Thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train crash ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side though, SOME scenes of the alien walkers are well made. <br /> <br /> The acting was as bad as it could have been, having been based directly on the book by H. Wells. By having such good source material, it's almost as if the actors were trying to be so exaggerated as to make it funny. And then there's the mustache ... the most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half of the movie contains acting. The rest are characters walking aimlessly and with ill-made effects. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. With the use of different color filters among the photos for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even internal scenes, the green screen bad, it is incredible to me how this man got approved to direct a film. I would not imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into a bad movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Angry. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone planning to see this movie is to do what I did: have some friends who like bad movies, drink, play poker while watching, keep drinking, and maybe you go do it all the way. He makes a great bad movie, so have fun and laugh at that mess.
