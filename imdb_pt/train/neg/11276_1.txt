I will not waste my time writing anything much more about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. This has already been done in great detail many times. The 'plot' began as a very big weariness of a big cock / gangster by numbers and very quickly went down in a total mess. Anyone who pretends they can see some masterpiece hidden inside this terrible mess is only fooling themselves. It's been 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1-week run at the movies before being taken out, but it still comes to mind as it's easily the most terrible movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm just making those comments, and in fact the only reason I went to see the movie, is because of the fun fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second 'heavy' on the scene pub. It was his hands that tossed a lighter toward Rhys Ifan's face at the bar in Russia (actually it was filmed at the old Butlins holiday camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he had recently joined an extras agency and that was his first part. Having seen the film, it seemed like no one in it needed any acting experience. <br /> <br /> I remember there were about 8 people all over the theater - and that was only a few days after it was released. . I've never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so. If you are thinking of renting this movie on DVD, I advise you to put your two-pound coins into the fire until they are hot, then trap them in the eye sockets. This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the movie.
