It's the early 80's. There's a group of teenagers who look suspicious. And there's a maniac walking around. Yes, that's slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called joking? I have no idea. Unless your idea of ​​a good joke is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on the scale, not a good joke; in fact, a joke if the truth is told. But there you go. <br /> <br /> The movie itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning a dorm dorm. They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they separate and wander in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks is a badly made horror movie. The DVD release I saw was that of Vipco. It seems to be cut off from some violence. This makes the DVD even more meaningless because, let's face it, a horror film deprived of violence is a waste of time. Only for nasty completers of horror movie and video.
