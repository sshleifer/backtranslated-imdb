:: POTENTIAL SPOILERS :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was horrible. A catholic / superstitious / thriller thriller that already passes, has already gone well of the previous films. <br /> <br /> The priest who doubted. Sex and the priesthood. Politics and religion. Hypocrisy of the church. Conspiracy involving the church. The dawn of a new evil age. All sorts of voodoo battles of black magic between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Too stupid and lame with a weak plot to be enough. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick - the last rights a person can ask to cleanse their sins while on the verge of death; And Excommunication, the act of cutting a person from the Church. Basically, an excommunicated person can not receive absolution. So comes the Eater of Sin, and I'll leave it like that. Throw in all the doped things I've listed and you have "The Order". <br /> <br /> I found the sex scene with the priest intertwined with pictures of an image of the Virgin Mary somewhat insulting to Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger saying (I paraphrased) "I am the redeemer and condemer of sins, I live without love, blah, blah blah" / I suggest walking in the dark alley with a long trench coat alla "The Matrix." <BR> I gave this film a 1 not only to be lousy and unoriginal, but also because it managed to insult a whole faith in the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
