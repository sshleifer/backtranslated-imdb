While the acting and directing could be discussed as having some merit - the plot is a very poor Vietnam movie with the country's name simply changed. At least for a movie to have some credibility, try and have some semblance of precision in equipment, weapons and tactics. Forget the gross misrepresentation of troop behavior as a norm. <br /> <br /> In addition to the limited use of silly propaganda on the South African Defense Force, it serves a small purpose - definitely no entertainment value. <Br /> <br /> Aspiring filmmakers - this is how you do not make a war movie. Do some research and have some pride in your product.
