The Good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good suits. High-level production. Constructions and vehicles well detailed in CGI. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> The horrible mix of actors with all CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. CGI actors look even worse than video games a few years ago. Faulty logic. A giant pyramid appears and nobody polls, does anyone really question that? And is there no explanation as to why the god Horus was expelled, nor was there any reason for him to do something as trivial as Jill impregnated? <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> Awful script. So many unnecessary subplots with many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialogue was almost laughable on some points. Random characters and events that are not needed. Dull characters. Jill must be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing for her. She is uninteresting and boring to watch. It has no substance, no texture. Your character has no redemptive qualities. In fact, there is not a character in the entire film that has any purpose, no purpose (beyond the obvious of Horus), any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. There are no bets - the key to screen writing. Horus will not become immortal, but, great thing, he's a bad guy. One can not even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character. That's the problem: dedicating half the film to each character means that the writer never fully explores a character, never makes it fruitful. They are cardboard cutouts that go around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the beautiful surroundings. First time director of rhythm. Slowly, slowly, slowly I'm still watching the movie as I write this. I can not pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. Even the action is not interesting because it is short and sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> General: <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. The shabby storyline, the sub-par character development, the ingenious CGI does not save the good production of the set.
