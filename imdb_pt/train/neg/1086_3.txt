Despite his impressive cast and pedigree, the Gingerbread Man collapses early and often. The plot is not realistic, the actors have bad accents and the participation of director Robert Altman is equivalent to collecting a paycheck. Once again he set up an impressive cast (like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman) which this time to the letter is mischievous. But that's just part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a high-powered Georgia lawyer who, in the heavy opening scenes of the film, manages to be ridiculed by a mysterious waitress who convinces him he is in grave danger of an ex-husband and a crazy dad. With red flags everywhere, the astute lawyer strives to get his children hurt. Gun and fist fights follow along with a necessary car chase and if that is not enough there is a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder with an unconvincing Southern accent. Running on a trench coat in all kinds of weather he is blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is as bad as an IP but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as old as Boo Radely has all grown crazier than a bedbug serving a few thick slices of ham, but at least his accent is plausible. Female leaders (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are thin and unemployed. Even the celebrity lawyers making cameos (Vernon Jordan) are wooden with the few lines to throw away they have. <br /> <br /> In addition to paying little attention to its actors, mise en scene of Altman dripping with Spanish moss is obscure and formless, his comic-book action scenes. It lacks its unusual touches and remarks (it informs the viewer that the Stars and Bars still beckon in Georgia) that make a well-done Altman so unique. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man is Altman at his worst, even if the payout is the same.
