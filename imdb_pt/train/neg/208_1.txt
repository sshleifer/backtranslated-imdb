Horrible movie with scattered Ramones pieces. Its comedy format worse than the average 70s / 80s of the cool kids who take over the school with some extravagant plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who likes the Ramones and a school committed to fighting its oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero, starring Guitar Wolf, if you want a fun B movie. Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot with the Ramones seal of approval that probably needed some quick money so they said yes to this movie. That's the only logical thing I can think of, because this movie explodes.
