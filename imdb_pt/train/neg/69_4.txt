I thought this was a very awkward, uninviting version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles and gave personality to their characters; but the whole thing seemed forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> The beginning could have been much more engaging; perhaps starting with a gunfight, and then flashing back to a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing. And I felt as if every scene was routinely predictable and flagged, like a really bad TV soap. <br /> <br /> I was really looking forward to this movie, and hoping for something much better. The only thing I can say in your favor is that it beats Mick Jagger's version, but not much.
