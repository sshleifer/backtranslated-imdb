Nothing to say, but Wow! Has anyone ever had anyone tucked away in an open field? Well, that happens about 25 times in this movie (clearly the favorite fear tactics of directors). In one of the opening scenes, the gentle and warm voice producer has to walk in the backseat so that the camera can sit in the front to film. Soon after he arrives on the field, the 5 competitors appear and although it is clearly at most 2 pm, everyone is convinced that the sun will set at any minute. After about 30 minutes of garbage without breasts, we are privileged with a flashback of the clown story in which we see some of its previous victims. If you watch this movie, check out the ladies chest ... its ribs go up to the neck, it was completely disgusting. Most horror movies occur at night, but without a night vision camera, chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few nocturnal shots that appeared in the film seem to have been stolen from the Blair Witch project or random shots from the directors' backyard. The movie redeemed itself a little at the end, when there was a matrix like tossing out with the clown we rewound and watched more and more laughing hysterically. <br /> <br /> ALWAYS RENT THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE BEEN SNUCK ON ON AN OPEN FIELD. <br /> <br /> SIGNED, THE ANSWER
