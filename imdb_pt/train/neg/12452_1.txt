This movie is so bad I can not even begin to describe it. What in the fire pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? How on earth did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is OK, but then keeps repeating until you want to disable it. <br /> <br /> I think I'm the biggest loser for not making this stupid movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> SPOLER ALERT <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it ... and it's in it ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give it 1 in 10 because it is the lowest rating that the IMDb has to offer. Do yourself a favor: watch a Uwe Boll movie ... twice ... it's more worthy of your time.
