My friends and I got into this movie without knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we left, we were just a bit more informed about what the plot of the movie really was. While not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. Maybe a friend rents to you (also not worth the cost of rent) if you really want to see him. <br /> <br /> When a movie is so complicated that you have no idea what is happening until the last five minutes, there is not much that can be said in your defense. The acting was decent, more than you'd expect to get with this movie, and some of the scenes were good, but everything was jammed with a lame plot and bad script. <br /> <br /> This movie was really so bad that as soon as it came out, I went and bought a ticket to see a good movie just clear my mind. I recommend that you all take the first step and see a good movie.
