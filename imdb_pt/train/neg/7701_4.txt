The original show was much better. They should have left on a good note. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, too dramatic, and the funny parts were too far away to make up for the slack. This movie really seemed to be trying very hard to be serious, and it definitely was not what I wanted from that sequel. Not to mention, that for a long time was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but try more next time. This movie is kind of boring, and it's not that funny. Excuse. 4/10 stars is this. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
