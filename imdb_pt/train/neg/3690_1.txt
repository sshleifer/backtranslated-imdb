Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused it to fall. It was released with a lot of hype, but it fell a lot and had huge financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to pay them in person for the losses incurred. Shortly after his release, he tried to venture into politics, but failed miserably. It's a really bad movie with horrible acting, poor makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some illness. I am one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in the theater. The audience was so bored that most of them left the theater before the break. Sorry, I will not recommend this to anyone.
