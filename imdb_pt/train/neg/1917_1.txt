This movie, while not entirely bad, should have been filmed where events occurred. Grand Island, Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is situated in the nearly depropriated and flat Platte River Valley in Hall County. The producers of this film filmed in the tree-covered hills of Ontario and changed the whole event to a nonexistent city called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island have bravely survived this awful night just to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie.
