I'm a big fan of Jenna Jameson, but this movie sucks. At the time, Jenna Jameson was married to Brad Armstrong and he was the director of the film and Jenna was the hottest porn star of all time. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could with her making this big-budget porn movie. Now I know why they do not do big budget porn movies anymore. In a fantasy world, porn stars could act, but this is the real world and they can not act. That's why there are porn stars, if a woman as beautiful as Jenna could act, she would have tried to get into conventional movies instead of porn. Just because your beautiful does not make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teenager through her 20s, she was one of the most beautiful and sexy women in the world. She made her move into popular low budget movies and could not act. Where is she now? I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she did then "Dream Quest". Come on, Jenna, we do not want to hear you talk as much as we want to see you having sex. Also, you, Jenna, would have a lot more fans and more money in your bank account if you had done anal in the movie.
