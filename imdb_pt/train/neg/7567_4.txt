The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she begins to believe that she is indeed a cyborg. At the institution, she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg ...' is a great starting point for family territory and (unfortunately) stronger. I'm a big fan of any movie or story that's trying to do something different. God knows, we're all under enough shit in local theaters. The main point about the movie that I need to say is that it does not say anything about mental illness, or it creates a character that you care about. <br /> <br /> This story has to be one of the strangest things I've seen in years ... but strange is not enough. There is no heart for the film ... just surrealism and confusion. The confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. All the characters try to understand their own problems, but it is Chan-wook Park who proves to be the most confused of them all.
