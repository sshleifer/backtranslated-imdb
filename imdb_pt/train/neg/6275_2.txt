A very unnecessary movie with characters who are acting so unsympathetic that I really did not care who would be the best (or was that the purpose of the movie, to portray some nice and cool New Yorkers?) No romance here, no comedy too . Acting is very flat and a very predictable plot. What bothered me most was this constant joke with quotes from classic films. Dude, can not you see that the more you date, the less significant your own movie becomes? Try to be original yourself! A small budget is no excuse, no first time director. Crap, crap, crap. No wonder it only cost me a little money ...
