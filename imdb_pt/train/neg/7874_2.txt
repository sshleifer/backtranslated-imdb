In a way, Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal: to be seen by thousands. But he can not make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs had its success, because the subject was an original way of considering the journey in time: forget the one of Zemeckis Back to the future, there comes the old France, the middle-aged knight and his almost barbaric lifestyle. Filled with pride, funny thanks to the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he retains his honor. Then comes the sequel. <br /> <br /> No one predicted the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's no use being a movie expert to realize that Time Runners were made for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time. paradox that would have required some second thought. Explanation: it is no use trying to recover the jewels that Jacquouille stole; Do not you remember this beautiful shiny and expensive car that he bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found the money? Selling the jewels ... And this is just one of the many holes Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, he's just a little more boring. In relation to Frenegonde ... this is another story: Valérie Lemercier decided not to commit herself in this sequence to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeois role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so unfortunate that I almost felt pain for her. And Poiré does not realize that a cast of comedians is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget time travel, about digital effects, focus on the story and you'll find that there is enough space on a postage stamp to write it 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A movie for young people, let's say up to 13 years.
