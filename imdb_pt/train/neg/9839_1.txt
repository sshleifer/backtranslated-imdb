The beginning of this movie was good. It started to get really dumb after he told people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I came from a town so I would be offended after seeing this movie. They made many of these people look dumb and crazy. How these people have so little to do that they follow him all day. Many times these people were telling him ways to kill themselves as if they were urging him to do it. How can so many people have little respect for other people? I also think they could have made a much better end to this movie. There were some good parts to this movie as well. Some people may like it, but I would not recommend this to anyone.
