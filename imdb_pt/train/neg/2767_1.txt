This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - beating the most horrible previous movie, "Spawn of Slithis," which I saw when I was 10 years old. <br /> <br /> Acting, flamboyant and ridiculous dialogues, incomprehensible plot, cut scenes, even the music was annoying. Did I leave anything out? Well, the special effects were not bad - but the CGI does not make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can not believe I spent money to see this movie. If someone has Hyung-rae Shim's contact information (the director), please forward it to my username "in gmail" and I'll contact you to request a refund.
