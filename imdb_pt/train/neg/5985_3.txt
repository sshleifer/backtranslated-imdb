This movie is just a kid against the evil genre. Thunderbirds is just the hook to get people to see it, but they are almost incidental in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a maneuver to attract the public. It was interesting to note what filmmakers see about future London and how the world fits. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film are some of the lines presented by Lady Penelope, which are highly comic. . This provided light relief to those expecting a reprise of the TV series. <br /> <br /> That said, she spends 90 minutes or more in a fun way and may be worth watching.
