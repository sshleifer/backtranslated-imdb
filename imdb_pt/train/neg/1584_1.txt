I read the man running from Kings' books as Bachman and I felt for the main character John and his family. This movie could have been so much more. The problem? It was created during the great craze of the action movie. I watched the movie and was in pain for the whole thing. I felt nothing for the character and less for his cause. Yes, it had funny (or laughable) scenes, though I did not think it did save the movie in my eyes. If you read the book, you may feel the climax and fire in John's heart as he takes revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a low number. It may not have been so low if I had not read the book.
