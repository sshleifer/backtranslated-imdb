London bored Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money to travel. Their lives become more thrilling as they begin to relate to the exotic Betty Amann (to Mr. Kendall) and to the lonely Percy Marmont (to Mrs. Barry). But they're still as boring as ever. Arguably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to animate the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from "The Tempest" by Shakespeare) "Rich and Strange," ordering some camera tricks. One of the earliest tributes to King Vidor's "The Crowd" is the highlight. The lowest point may be the couple having a Chinese cat prepared.
