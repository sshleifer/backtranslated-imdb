If you have ever watched the Dukes of Risk, you know you never had to worry about drugs or malicious or coarse behavior being seen by young children. If you've seen the movie, you know it's not the case anymore! This movie was HORRIBLE! Main characters doing drugs and thinking it's funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment. They did a wonderful show and just turned it into garbage. Daisy, who was a bit flirtatious in the original show, now looks and acts as if she belonged on the corner being paid for her services. I was so excited to see this movie before leaving, 15 minutes in the movie that I was ready to leave. I kept thinking I had to improve, but instead it got worse by the minute. I wish I had never seen this movie. He destroyed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something that's worth your money because it's not just a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life that you will never return!
