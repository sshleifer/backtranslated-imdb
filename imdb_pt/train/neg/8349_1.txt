Guy walking for no reason ... I'll never get those two hours of my life back. The guy continued to take on identities and betrayed his pregnant wife. What was I thinking? How did it get a price anywhere? I understood that he loved his father, but other than that, the movie was completely meaningless to me. What was the point of walking so far and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason. How did this enrich your life ??? Why did we have to see the old woman dying of panties ???? !!! Because ??? ! <br /> <br /> I thought it would be deep or about something more interesting. I do not recommend the movie even to go out while sleeping ...
