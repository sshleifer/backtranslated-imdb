I grew up watching Inspector Gadget. It was, and still is, one of my favorite designs, if not my absolute favorite. I learned a lot of geography and history with Inspector Gadget's Field Trip spin-off. I wanted to slip into a banana peel and become the greatest detective of all time. <br /> <br /> But the movie ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon. <br /> <br /> Matthew Broderick, an actor with potential, was definitely not the role of Inspector Gadget. First thing: in the movie, Inspector Gadget is smart. Not so in the cartoon. In the movie, Gadget solves the mystery mostly alone. In the cartoon, it was almost always Penny, Brain and the incredible book (I still want her book!). If Gadget solved the mystery, it was by chance. Gadget in the movie seems to be a competent detective, but in the drawing was very dumb, that was where the mood came from. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it's too much "Good Guy v. Bad Guy" in the movie. It's not just to be a silly drawing on Saturday morning. Also, Gadget should never have a love story, but the Disney Corporation is full of idiots. <br /> <br /> I also miss the real gadgets Gadget had, and especially the Gadget car. In the movie, it was a fancy convertible. In the cartoon, it was a police sedan car and could turn into a van. He also barely had gadgets and was there to get him from one place to another. <br /> <br /> But at most, what was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature film. Inspector Gadget was a silly drawing on Saturday morning. The film was very serious, very exaggerated, had a lot of plot and was not even so funny. <br /> <br /> Tip for those who have not yet seen: NEVER see it. EVER. Watch the cartoon, it's a true classic.
