I really tried to like this movie. This is a major problem in any society: sex addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story, we learned that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, having nonstop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, eccentric, neurotic) puts their marriage, job and even life at risk. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of production are terrible; mainly the performance. Oh, you will not like any of the sex scenes, most of them are made with very bad taste and you may think you are watching a home movie. <br /> <br /> Second, the plot is just not meaningful. How could such a wise and beautiful wife bear all the unpleasant things of her husband? How could she believe him? The trio situation is invaluable and will make you laugh for a while. <br /> <br /> In addition, the scene with the black movie clerk is just useless and will let you think "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like these you'll find plenty. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please avoid this; it is not soft core, it is not documentary, it is not a dramatic feature. It's a pretentious effort by the so-called documentary director or whatever. <br /> <br /> Just the legs of Mrs. Kinski on display are worth it. I got on HBO and I'm glad I did not spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life will not come back.
