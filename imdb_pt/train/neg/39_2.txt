An actress making a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where she is kept in ransom. The producer hires someone to go and bring it back. Complicating all are the jungle cannibals who love a really ugly "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a bloody despicable movie. There is a tremendous amount of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It is an exploration film designed to attract the darkest parts of our being and, if the film were not so boring, this movie would be a classic. Let's face it, despite the blood, sex and abuse unpleasant, and the ugly monster that this movie is a suspense. The rhythm is out of order and puts you off. There are several plot lines that seem to be happening separately from each other, although, ultimately, it's one story. Worst of all, hardly anyone says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue is about cruelty or a character protest that "I will do what I want." It's such a quiet and boring film that if it were not for the frequent screams of the victims, I would recommend it as a sleep helper. <br /> <br /> This is a film to avoid, unless you need to sleep, or unless you need to see all the European cannibal movies. <br /> <br /> (One side, VideoAsia has just released this as part of its Terror Tales series.) Their impression is strangely in a mailbox that seems to be the result of its printing from a Japanese source (there is haze ) that has been cut to remove captions.
