A previous reviewer called this film "pure visual joy." I'm wondering if he / she saw the same movie that I did. "High Art" had to have the interiors more relentlessly depressing since "Seven." Sheedy and Mitchell can almost be forgiven for the clich√© of going to a B & B for the first time. Of course, before doing this, one must look at groups of opium dwellers inhabited by people who are apparently not well-employed but who can somehow support a flourishing drug habit. Not to mention the icy stares of those types of family movies, the Girlfriend / Boyfriend In The Beginning, who are well aware that they will be played sometime in the next 100 minutes or more. The film also claims that Sheedy retired from professional photography ten years ago. What did she do, retire at age twenty?
