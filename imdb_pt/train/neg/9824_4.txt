Not being familiar with the US television stations, when I plugged it into my in-laws' cable, I first thought it was just a low-budget science fiction movie, so after a few minutes I started to think it could be a smart satire on the worst excesses of Christian fundamentalists, and then I realized - good pain, these people are serious! It's been a while since I've seen something so unintentionally hilarious. I hesitated to write a review on this for fear of offending the believers, but then I saw other comments and thought, hey, they can accept. Philosophical Enigma: How do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what you are criticizing? Answer: Do it in such a way that the only people who appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movie you are criticizing. I suppose some liberals (ugh! Spit when you say that!) You may be offended by the contempt of the filmmakers for those in the audience who are not obsessed with the J **** C myth, but I do not mind - it was so funny!
