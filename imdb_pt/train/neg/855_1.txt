Not the best of the movies to watch these days. I read a lot of comments on the brightness and was hoping it would be pretty good. But this movie disappointed me. The sound and ambiance were good, but there was no story here. There was not a single moment of fear. I expected this for a horror thriller, but there was no horror thriller. The only scene I was afraid of was during the chapter-changing scene that showed "Wednesday." There are many fragments in the film. Most things are left unexplained, with nothing to bind you to anything. The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that are shown. It might be a good movie to watch in the '80s, but not for the 21st century.
