So do not even think about renting it in the shops, because this is a bad movie. You'd think JJ Abrahams had written this movie. Basically, a mouse is thrown into the toilet and somehow needs to come out again. Fans of the utterly awful "Shrek" might like it, but fans of "Wallace & Gromit" are likely to turn away in disgust. Also, why did not they do this in plasticine or clay? I mean, CGI animation? For an AARDMAN movie ?? Obviously, Aardman approached while letting Dreamworks do the whole thing. Wrong, Wrong, WRONG !!! Almost all the characters are terrible, besides that weird guy who is the right guy for a movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. It's just terrible. But fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek".
