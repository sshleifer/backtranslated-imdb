It's one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I do not see where all this junk comes from, 'It's not too bad.' The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same plot of all the other 'dance' movies out there. It's terrible! The name should scream I do not watch. 'How she moves.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had decent dance scenes, these do not even deserve a clock. I give a 1 out of 10, just because there is zero. I sincerely implore someone with an IQ of over 60 years not to watch it, and not waste their money. 1.6 / 10 should say it all. This movie should not even be done.
