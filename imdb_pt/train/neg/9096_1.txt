I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've watched in a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get the same characters with different people is a bad idea. If they could not put Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in one of them, they should have just cut their losses and said with that. Instead, they get NEW actors who are horrible at what they did. I felt seriously like I was in a high school or (bad) college play with the leverage that these people do. <br /> <br /> Where do they get some of these people from? Was this their first movie? Surely it seemed so. <br /> <br /> This film is also parallel to the original in some lines of expression. I had just watched the first one and appeared in second place. I was all excited to watch the second and it turned out to be the worst show I've seen in a while. I almost never * turned off a movie, but this definitely came out after about 30 - 40 min.
