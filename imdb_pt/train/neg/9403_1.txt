This movie should not qualify as cinema. Although he is over 10 now, he should never have gotten funding, and it's a plague in the Australian film industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as "The Dish." can not act, the music is ... to be direct, not music, the story is completely non-existent and it's a struggle to sit down. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time.
