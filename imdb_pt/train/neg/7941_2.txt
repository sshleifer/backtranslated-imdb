As the 2000s came to an end, King Kong's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement that her show would end. <br /> <br /> While Miss Winfrey was ripping, I was laughing and screaming like a savage. Indian from the old west. <br /> <br /> So what does Oprah do? she takes famous people and puts them on her show. What kind of famous people? People who suffered (as well as her, except that these people lost more than their virginity) suffered melted faces (true story), missing members (true story, see end of paragraph), and spouse abuse (many for counting). and somehow they enter the show and tell their story, as if we had not heard this before tons and tons of times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story about losing an arm to a shark from the first day that was in October March 31, 2003. Do not tell me you have no hard feelings.) But the most likely thing in Oprah was probably Michael Jackson's 1993 interview after being accused of being a child molester. unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has passed away. but that particular show told of Michael's personal life, something many people did not know at the time. <br /> <br /> Oprah's real influence comes from middle-aged women and soccer moms. They seem to think she's like a personal Jesus sometimes. but all I see in Oprah is a great lady from the ghetto who made it successful, and she's just showing how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad your shows are ending soon. we need better television programs.
