Imagine a woman alone in a house for forty-five minutes when absolutely nothing happens. So this goes on two more times. The writing is flat and lifeless, and plays dull, and bad acting prevents you from caring for any of the characters, even when they fight against werewolves and are beaten by the hoodlums of the fraternity. Anyone who has rated this movie above two is not entirely sensible.
