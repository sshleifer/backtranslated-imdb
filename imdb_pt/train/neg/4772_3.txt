Before watching this movie, I could already say that it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with the place where they were and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the handcuffs). The name of MJH in a movie usually pulled me away (ugh, can we say GROSS?!), But I still wanted to try. <br /> <br /> Starting, I was a little interested. The acting is absolutely horrible and I found myself laughing at almost every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was even worse, but I kept watching. <br /> <br /> However, the end was the biggest joke of all! I seriously sat in shock thinking "Was that the end? Is this a comedy?". <br /> <br /> I thought this pile of crap was funnier than the parodies of the "horror movie" and that is REALLY saying something!
