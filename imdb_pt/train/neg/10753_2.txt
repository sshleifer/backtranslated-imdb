Del - "You're the dumbest, smartest person I've ever met." <br /> <br /> Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost in the rewrites." <br /> <I guess what I find most striking about this bastardization of Asimov's work was how Susan Calvin's character was portrayed. In books, she was actually one of the first female protagonists, able to think about her problem. Here she is just a damsel in distress, waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> There are passing references to the Asimov Robotics Laws, but they are a belated reflection for the action scenes and CGI. <br /> <br /> Smith is nice, as he is in most of his films, but honestly, the story is not so good. You figure it out long before these cool characters do that.
