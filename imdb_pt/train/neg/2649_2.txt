My wife and I started watching this movie in advance. It seemed warm and touching. It all started well; but soon became boring and downright stupid after a while. It was so bad we hung up. The film was misunderstood and honestly we could not really understand or wanted to understand exactly why or how the hell they could handle this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting crazy singing and cleaning. I would have compromised her. And, of course, like most movies and TV series made in Hollywood, we have to cast a symbolic "gay" character! This movie was annoying. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!
