This one goes back to the days of the matinee, when children with nowhere else to go took their encounters to the porch after leaving their younger brothers below. It did not matter what was on the screen - little children sat and big kids ignored her. Adults, of course, would never see him. <br /> <br /> But they put him on video, anyway, along with most of the other low-budget, "Golden Age" horror films. of television. The inherent and unintended humor of this film is derived from the obsolete ideology (the "bad girls" collected to replace the crushed body of poor Jan - they brought it), a violent but conscientious monster (a mad scientist, trying to play God) whose presence in the rural laboratory of the apparently normal scientist so far is never fully explained) and polarizing acting in wood or over-the-top. <br /> <br /> This is a great party movie, assuming your guests enjoy adding dialogue and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic explorations. In fact, if you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment, this movie will also be available on video in their "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment, in which the presenter and cult TV series dolls make the necessary additions to you .
