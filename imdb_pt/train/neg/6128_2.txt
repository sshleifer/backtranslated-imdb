This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can not base a whole movie on it! <br /> <br /> Characters are too stereotyped, there is no real story - but short episodes with weird side characters, who are not so strange enough to make the plot genuine. <br /> <br /> Shame, because most of the actors are recognized in Hungary, a mystery because they took over the roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring, though it was to be genuine or unique. They could have tried much more than this ... 2 of 10
