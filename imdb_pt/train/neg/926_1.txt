This film is about Tyrannus, a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon Tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn after about an hour, is also called Demonicus. This adds much-needed depth to the script and calls into question our assumptions about identity, psychology, and ourselves. <br /> <br /> Tyrannus' spirit performs its short to-do list (killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in Latin) by owning the body of a college student. He wears a mental control helmet to do this, which the college kid lavishes on his head and then at various points in the film, strip and put it back. <br /> <br /> Maria does oral sex on a poor man Sean Willian Scott, and Tyrannus wears the Rollerball glove. Tyrannus has its own green backlight for no reason, and apparently sits next to a CG fire in an old concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Total misery. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. Look.
