There were good performances from Robin Williams and others, but the film was boring and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews. <br /> <br /> I thought Sy could become a serial killer that annoys people to the death: a desperate guy wearing ugly clothes drag their victims through the food courts, quoting Oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg for he shoots them. <br /> <br /> I think the film attracts mostly egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their pictures. I hope most retail workers want a break from customers.
