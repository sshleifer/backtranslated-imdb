Now look, I'm not going to lie to you, but I only got this $ 3.99 movie from a friend because there was Danni Filth, the lead singer of the ever-popular death metal band Cradle Of Filth. I expected, of course, violence and blood at its best, as is what Mr. Filth can be pictured in, among a plot. <br /> <br /> But, dear god, I was so wrong. This movie bites seriously, big time. Being a low-budget movie (haha, wait, do that ZERO BUDGET), this obviously does not have the beautiful musical scores of the Howard Stern orchestra and the special effects of Spielberg. No, it's all a camera, bad angles and scenes of bad blood. <br /> Take for example when our star and violent demon, Mr Filth, violently kills a burglar. A claw in the throat, and blood comes out, but oh my, it looks like there's a packet of juice filled with fake blood on the man's shirt. For you Cradle of Filth fans: you'll hear two songs throughout the movie, but with camera angles and shoddy footage, they drag the overall pleasure of the song to DOWNLOAD. <br /> <br /> My final comment: Get away from her. It's blood, blood, breasts and hey, even a poor quality story to follow. So, if you like scary violence, almost no voices (yes, there are almost no words in this movie), then by all means buy it. But if shoddy movies are not your thing then avoid. Do not waste your money.
