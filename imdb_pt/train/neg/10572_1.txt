*** SPOILERS LEVES *** A 15-year-old humpback boy kisses a cute 15-year-old girl and ends up having sex for the first time. After the act, he lies in bed with her not touching her. The next day, he concludes that he does not like sex very much and does not want to try again for at least a few years. <br /> <br /> This is apparently a good opening for a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality. or perhaps a medical drama about a post-adolescent adolescent with severe hormone deficiency. <br /> <br /> However, as the plot unfolds, there is a story of a 15-year-old father who is supported and encouraged by his authoritarian mother. At one point, his mother preaches to her co-workers who are not as understanding as they could be, "Every step of the way, my son has been incredible ... I've never been prouder of him ... "<br /> <br /> The younger brother's older sister, who otherwise is cold to her brother, begins to show pride in her brother," You've been cool about it, "as she gives you a warm and encouraging hug. <br /> <br /> The 15-year-old father wants to be a father. He wants to be a father. <br /> <br /> Why not? We see the "new" baby a few minutes after birth - it appears to be a healthy, happy, four-month-old baby. Just as babies were born on TV in the 60s and 70s. Once the young father is a father, he has found happiness. He insists he's going to change his dirty diaper. We see the sincerely happy 15 year old father holding his baby while the teenager's busy mother is approaching. Darkening.
