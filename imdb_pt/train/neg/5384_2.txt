All the hype! What better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can not release their movie through a conventional distributor? Consequently, they do it alone. Otherwise, the hype of the film does not justify the content of the movie. The story is absent and could easily be short. The acting is bad, but the animation and music are very good. Otherwise, do not waste your time - do not believe the hype! However, if you have the chance to watch the movie for free, do so. Then you will not have to spend money. Still, the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent miniseries. Otherwise, they are a success that have never been successful.
