The DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and Segals voice not even his !!!! Pathetic! When audio synchrony is better in about 5 minutes, poor plot, lines and actors should get another job, because the film industry is not where anyone should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had good movies in the movies. In the early days, the latest ones are a joke and should be a shame to him and to the company that did it. <br /> <br /> If Segal was the only one to deal with it, he'd better have another party to run the show, because he has no talent whatsoever. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who have seen it. I hung up in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll be asking for my money back on Block Buster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
