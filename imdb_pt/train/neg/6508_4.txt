This is a robbery of Frankenstein's old premise. An acclaimed scientist is killed in a freak accident and his father, a neurosurgeon, saves his brain. It is then placed in a robotic body of its own design. His brother, a genius of electricity, gives the impetus of "colossus" to transfer thoughts into movement. The whole project goes awry when the creation gets frantic. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not developed. The script is missing. And it's funny that this is not a little scary. Well, very young children will think this is good. If you're wide awake at three in the morning and it happens ... night, night. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff threw the 'Colossus'.
