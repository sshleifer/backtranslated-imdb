I'm 13 and I hated this movie is the worst movie in the world I totally wasted my time watching and was disappointed because on the cover and back the movie looks very good, but I was wrong, it's bad. but when I saw delta she was totally different and a bad actress and I really did not know how old the 2 girls were trying to be I was so confused. The movie was confusing in some parts and I did not like anything, but I watched the whole movie just to see if it would improve, but it did not stay, it was annoying, boring and I said BORING.and I do not think many other people liked it as much as I.
