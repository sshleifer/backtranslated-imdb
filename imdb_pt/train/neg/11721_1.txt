This movie was awful. The script is COMPLETELY unrealistic, but written to happen in the real world, the editing and lighting effects are worse than most of the early projects at film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone. : A) knows any detail about the world of police or secret operations. B) knows any detail about making movies or enjoying. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to the average or below average mind, I think it would be fun if I were an ass. If you must watch this movie in a full mind, I recommend some kind of inebriation <br /> <br /> It is a total waste of what little production value you have.
