This movie begins with a certain promise; but, in my view, he begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That this well-meaning stranger starts to fix his car while he's out making a phone call is implausible enough but that she's one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on the rails is the type of writers who start the coincidence are warned against using in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this average movie at best. Art direction could have been much better, as it could have been cinematography. The performance was good, as was the singing of Eva van der Gucht.
