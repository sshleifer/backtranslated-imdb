I have to agree with most everyone's opinions that this program was poorly produced and also written. The acting was not much higher than the lower production figures, but I feel that an actor can only rely on the material provided and do the best they can. . According to this thought, I feel it is important to note that an actor has risen and persevered well beyond this insipid and insipid production, becoming a respectable and quite talented artist. I'm referring to Laura Harris, a Canadian actress who has recorded En route to many badly produced shows and movies to find a spot on HBO's hit "Dead Like Me," where she plays Daisy Adair and to her credit, she deals with this role efficiently. about the young actress during this series where she played Ashley a 7th grade smooth but intelligent speech. I felt as if anyone could "do" from this series, it would certainly be Laura Harris and true to her nature she excelled in acting field to earn the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as the exclusive fascination of the Nordic blondes. If you've ever had the opportunity to see this series, I recommend you have something epic to watch for wings like 'Godfather' or maybe 'Beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is, after all, a lot of integrity in true production. and I value this and that this series is just a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply say about her time on the show and I bet she would cite many defense words from young actors saying "It's a start!"
