There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? AND WHY DOES MOVIES MAKE THIS EVIL ??? The premise is absurd. Thre acting is one-dimensional. Special effects are exaggerated. And the film is an endless battle between some of the worst scenes Hollywood has ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everyone would have died in the first five minutes and there would be no movies. Too bad that did not happen that way. Tried to turn it off several times, I stayed with him to see how bad he could get. I'm glad I did because (SPOILER?) The last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, somber scenario. It's not even worthy of second-resort status on a third-rate drive-in in the off season. In addition to the overall horror of the movie, I worry deeply about its impact on the young audience. The Americans give a damn of those and then wonder why there are events like Columbine. This is a truly banal cinema on a brobdingnagian scale!
