Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics, it was Dan. But how come Bill Corcoran made such a bad movie about Dan Jansen's incredible story? The story of Dan Jansen is truly incredible! Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman, everything is wrong, the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors skid, his technique, the size of the speedskating oval, it's all wrong! <br /> <br /> What a shame for you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
