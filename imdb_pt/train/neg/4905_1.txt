I am usually disappointed with networked movies. Even the flix that attracts big names of actors is usually ruined by the people of the TV. However, this is the worst of the worst. The script is weak and the performance, especially that of Tracey Pollan, is abominable. I crawled to see my children's school play and be treated with a better acting. Pollan acts as if he's reading the script as he talks. When it tries to express fear, anger or sadness, it is extremely hollow. Due to the overall quality of the production, I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to tackle this, be prepared for a big disappointment. Scary things will not scare you, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not make you feel hot and confused and you'll probably be as anxious as I am to see the end come. "First to die" says a lot about this movie.
