... is the only way to describe this film on themes that must be infallible: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst plays her role as the silent movie star Marion Davies, as she thinks she is in "Legally Blonde". The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst rushes to the point of wanting to hit the screen and slap him. Eddie Izzard is very good, except that he is playing Charlie Chaplin, and has about 125 pounds too heavy for the role? Hard to believe that this wrecked and unequal accident was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but again he did not do a movie watched, what? 30 years? Sometimes there is no way back.
