One of the "adulthood" movies that should have nostalgia for adults and promise to kids. This movie does not have any. It's a bad excuse to let the body of Sylvia Kristel play with Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is silly or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy or dramatic. Laughing awkwardly, as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would just bury a dead woman in his front yard. Think vigorously about why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a double body. As the movie continued, I began to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that led Sylvia Kristel to seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt, as Howard Hesseman left us nostalgic for the WKRP. Watch this to laugh at the stupidity of other people, or at the committed performance of Ed Begley Jr., or to imagine what Sylvia Kristel would be like with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from movies that face Sylvia Kristel who are not Emmanuelle.
