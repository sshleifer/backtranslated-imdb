As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could have done with it!" Chances are, you will too. It starts intriguing. A British ranger who lives in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a beautiful and demure woman (Lisa Zane) he met in a park not long ago. Then one day it disappears. The police are unable to find any documentation she has ever existed, and Firth conducts her own quest. So far, so good. Just as he's about to give up, he turns to his best womanizer friend (Billy Zane), and they come across his old life in the nasty underground of drugs, nightclubs and movie movies, and then with his story of mental instability. . At this point, Firth's life is in danger and the film falls apart. None of Lisa Zane's past characters are remotely interesting. The film moves slowly and there is little action. There is a subplot about drug shortage, but it's just a waste. No pursuits, no cliffhanging sequences and no suspense. Just a few beatings and a lot of boring talk. One thing worth noting, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never show up in a scene together. At the end of the movie, you are torn between imagining what could have been and trying to stay awake.
