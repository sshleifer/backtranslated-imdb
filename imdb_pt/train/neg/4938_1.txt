The cave man was by far the biggest load of crap I've ever wasted my time watching. This show based on Geico commercials is less fun than a 30-second ad for Geico. The makeup was kind of thick to say the least, hard to imagine a caveman with perfect white teeth even after going to the dentist. This show could have potential for a funny series, if they could get the cast of the commercials, which in itself makes a bad show. Maybe if the writers were the same as the Geico ads, that might have been a chance, instead the pilot did not have a good story. I give this show a 1 out of 10, I would put a zero of 10, but that was not an option. I pray for a quick death for this show, I would give less than 5 episodes before he dies a worthy death.
