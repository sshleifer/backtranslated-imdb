This wretched movie shows that not even some of the best of Gollywood can save a real garbage dump. <br /> <br /> I could spend a lot of time describing everything that was bad about this effort, but that would require more time and I. I already lost 91 minutes watching ... IT. Looking now, after Brando's death, shows how the life of one of our greatest actors has become tragic. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland? Because? <br /> <br /> I have to fill in more lines for this to be accepted. I have to fill in more lines to get this accepted. I have to fill in more lines for this to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this movie. I'm late to do something interesting. Goodbye.
