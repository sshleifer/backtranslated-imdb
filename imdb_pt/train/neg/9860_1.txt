I usually like movies like that. It's a documentary style, but acting and writing are terrible. The acting is wood and hard and the writing is so clich√©, but not at all good. As for typing, I'm surprised it's in a 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I am sure that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the film. I suppose, if that's the case, you can have some laughs, since it's always funny to see your relatives / friends making a movie. Well, in a way, I think this gives hope to all writers, directors, actors, etc., because if they can do this, you can do it. Although, maybe you should not.
