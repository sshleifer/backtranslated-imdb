The only thing worse than waveless surfers is a movie about waveless surfers. For viewers who love to surf this movie will be a gigantic disappointment, as the total number of minutes of surfing footage strives to reach three. <br /> <br /> The story is a slice of life from stranded surfers who are waiting not perfect wave, but for any wave. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging surfer who is flirting with a commitment to his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is about to find happiness grown up with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends appear and convince him to go to the beach in search of giant waves in Bone Yard. The problem is that there are no waves until the end of the film, so most of the story dissipates in a succession of disconnected events on the beach. <br /> <br /> The acting is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a few comedic moments, but mostly his acting was worldly. Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug dealing with the wild man, by far the most interesting and quirky character in the group. Probably the funniest performance was delivered by Peter Gunn as Terry, who turned his corpulent body into a continuous gag. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as ever, but her character did not have enough flesh to show a lot of acting ability. <br /> <br /> There is not much here to comment. I rated a 3/10. It's a real boring beach.
