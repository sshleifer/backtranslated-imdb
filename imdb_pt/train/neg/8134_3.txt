A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. He and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. He seems to hear a strange noise, and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling on the picnic blanket. He wants to go on a cave tour, which has something to do with some kind of work he's doing, but she wants to enjoy her honeymoon. She gives in. They go on tour, but leave the group to kiss. It falls on a slope, where it is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange noise again, and seems to know that a bat is approaching; one does and goes into her hair. He fights her, and attacks him, biting his forehead. <br /> <br /> They leave the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he begins to have convulsions in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He gets angry when that happens. He is unable to drink alcohol without spitting. His wife worries about anger, and he initiates a Pasteur treatment for this, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people are dead. We see parts of man's transformation into a bat person. It seems like it's not just in your mind. If the bat bite causes such transformations it is not clear, since it was already having some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> Although the title seems inappropriate, the implication in the end is that the same thing is happening to someone else. Not a very good movie, but I liked the variety of desert sites, caves and ski slopes and some of the strangest scenes. I did not think this was as bad as other people, and I did not think the 1999 movie, Bats, was as bad as everyone else thinks (I rated it 5/10).
