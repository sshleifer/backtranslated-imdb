Holy Week is a jaw dropping. It's so wrong in so many ways that I do not know where to start. So let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose husband judge was shot while protecting her, is going from Madrid to Seville for police work. During Holy Week (Holy Week, see? ... everyone starts to sleep. Until you've been bad on so many points from the beginning), a murderer executes his victims like bulls in a bullfighting arena. She joins the chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and the nice Feodor Atkine. Soon she discovers that she will be the assassin's next target (wearing a red tunic). Why, oh but why? <br /> <br /> Why ...; this is the question that has been in my head the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did I go see this? I love Mira Sorvino (I even apologize for this crap from FIRST SIGHT) <br /> <br /> Q: Why were there only 8 people in the theater this Saturday on the first release weekend? A: ah-ah-ah The spider-man was relaunched the same day. But also the fact that the film was released with execrable criticism. <br /> <br /> Q: Why was this movie made? A: Money, I think. But did the boy need the money? <br /> <br /> then ... why ???????????? First of all, there is always something wrong with European co-productions. here you have a production in French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then he wants to play in the same playgroung as thrillers USA / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever. Even VALENTINE, though unnecessary and poorly scripted and filmed, was much better at suspense and fun. <br /> <br /> So, to give some credence to the story, the writer wanted to add some political insight to the story. . Wrong: Made in flashbacks in a Traffic-type photo, it's certainly the most interesting thing in the movie. I could have stuck to it, I would not have to go through the whole movie. Better to go straight to the devil's ridge, of Guillermo del Tros, for intelligent amusement. <br /> <br /> Then homophobia. Target! The first victims are S & M drug addicted gay twins who were stabbed to death. The annoying Olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency maintained by a poorly shaved transvestite and a blonde platinum wig. It calls the character of mira Sorvino a great dike all the time. Do we need this kind of thing? Nah Just unnecessary offensive remarks, as well as ol'times. <br /> <br /> So the suspense. Yipee No apparent reason. The first murders are pure illusion, as they are a representation of a famous painting. But not. And the killer's revelation (a horrible fascist, of course) could have been made from the beginning, as it appears at the end of the movie as, I guess, it was time for the director to say "weel, time to finish this." damn movie. we will now reveal who the killer is and why he kills. "So the director thinks he is a director. Wrong: no sense of suspense, no sense of direction of the actors, no knowledge of change (maybe a rule of co-production saying, okay, filming in Seville, but show some credits of this beautiful and historic city with the Easter celebrations.) There we are Mira Sorvino gets bored to death: she practically does nothing except be stabbed in the right hand.Everything she does Olivier Martinez ... hello, anyone here? When the producers learn that he is not an actor, but a mannequin without the ability to speak or speak Feodor Atkine, bland and transparent. of respect to Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses of the last century (and I hope there are more roles in this one). It is the main attraction here, because it is the only one to give life to its poor lines. I will not mention the other actors, because they are only unilateral characters, uninteresting and superficial. <br /> <br /> Inconsistent direction, inconsistent actors, implausible plot. Incarnate idiocy. <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
