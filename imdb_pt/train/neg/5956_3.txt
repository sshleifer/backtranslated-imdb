Another horror movie in which a crazy teenager fights a madman and his supernatural helper who wants to take over? Yes, but the fact that this one is from Canada gives a slightly different feel. "The Brain" has troubled adolescent Jim Majelewski being put on a treatment whose leader ends up being a cult leader aided by an ugly big brain. Can Jim stop him? I think that since our northern neighbor has accomplished everything they've accomplished, they have the right to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. But still, they will probably want to be known for having national and all health care. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had a brain. Why the people who made this movie were not?
