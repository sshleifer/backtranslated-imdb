I hate being the only one to rain on a parade (even a small one like this), but from the first scene, you could say that this movie was going to be absolutely crap. It's really a shame, as I quite like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was intrigued about how they would blend into a movie together, but to my amazement, they did not even have a scene together !! I think I need to repeat that - the two main actors (who stand side by side in the propaganda posters and the DVD covers) did not have a scene together !!!! They did not talk and never appeared on screen at the same time. Just sum up this poor excuse for a movie. Fake advertising. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, each character in the film was unrealistic and not human. The scenarios were unlikely, the plot was crap, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried very hard to be funny (and played a poor man Tim's office), no one was friendly and worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that almost me led to shut down, as I could not bear to watch, or listen to them any longer. <br /> <br /> This low-budget stinker was an epic flaw. Even Danny Dyer could not inject some humor and charm into it, but bless him, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> As anyone could rate this movie as 'ten stars' is beyond me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on ... I will not even give it to some of the big ten stars, as ten stars indicate that a movie was perfect. This movie was far from perfect, almost the opposite, meaning that it was almost completely awful. <br /> <br /> Watch if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies, and watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
