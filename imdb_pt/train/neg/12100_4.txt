Now do not get me wrong. If you need an insightful summary of all that was wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a perfect pathway to a brighter future for mankind, who better to turn to than a comedian and pop culture practitioner? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid and solid reasons religion has survived its usefulness, then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for the love of God! That's a good point in itself. Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how all of its society, art, and science is rooted in it. <br /> <br /> In this film, he relies heavily on his sharp set of skills of irony and cynicism. to make your point when trying to appear scholarly and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect is not up to the task. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but clearly it is not the box's brightest lamp. As an example, it responds to an affirmation of one respondent (and I use the term loosely as they were all "ambushees") that the existence of Jesus is a historical fact with an impassive "No, it is not" followed by a long look contemptuous convey the naivety of the subject (a device nauseatingly used in this film). The problem is that the person was right and Maher was wrong in his statement that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically suspect gospels. I think Mr. Maher never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the masses will join this pseudo-documentary, as do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and make loud noises. and laughter (they certainly did on my show). <br /> <br /> It is doubly revealing, that the biggest and most meticulously braying occurred during the about 70% of the runtime that the film devoted to it. anti-Christian shots while the audience was completely mute during the 10% signal dedicated to criticizing the self-described Religion of Peace. Hmmm Or is the critique of Islam off limits to the modern and liberal target audience or were they only with afraid to laugh Quite saying, anyway ..
