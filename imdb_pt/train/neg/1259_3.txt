Thank you hollywood. However, another movie classic was completely ruined by an inexpensive, superficial, cumbersome and redundant remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" was a clever and thought-provoking film with a very clear message. It was a film that focused almost entirely on the dialogue, which sounds very annoying, but in fact was very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, seems to have virtually eliminated ALL dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we have an incredibly stupid movie of two hours of chase. The dialogue has been reduced to a minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it is extremely difficult to find out what is going on. Instead, we have a bunch of nonsensical action shots, some marginally funny catch phrases, and some almost smart conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The makeup of the monkeys is magnificent, and the scenery and scenery are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very superficial and simplistic film, full of paper-thin characters, stupid dialogues and a nearly non-existent plot. Please, Hollywood, stop ruining big movies, turning them into meaningless blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Ah, yes, the end did not make ANY SENSES. <br /> <br /> * out of stars ****, especially for the visual <br /> <br />
