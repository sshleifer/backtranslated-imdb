I can barely find the words to express how utterly awful this movie is. I've been sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth planes, which usually make for a fun action movie. I can honestly say that I'd rather rip my eyes out with a cocktail stick than having to watch this movie again. The acting was so terrible that it was almost funny. The story was insanely weak, with plot holes so cavernous that you could fly through them. The script was so bad, if I found out that a 10-year-old wrote that I should not be at all surprised. The direction and the production are so amateurish that I would not hire these people to film my wedding video of the worst enemies. Total Drug Total. Those responsible for making this movie cheapened the art and should be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal should never show his face in public again, I can not imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life.
