This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is (I think) a story of a college basketball player rebellious, his tough but fair coach, his girlfriend and a colleague (played by Michael Margotta) who has continuous nervous problems. The story goes nowhere, no character development, no one to worry about, and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as a trainer, are terrible. It's hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could handle such a horrible movie. Be sure to avoid this turkey.
