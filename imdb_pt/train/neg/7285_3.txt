The sun must set in this movie, forever. <br /> <br /> It lasts forever (which is not usually a bad thing - The English Patient, Schindler's List), but it's so tedious. The aging of the actors is unbelievable, as is the unfolding of an endless story that really seems to go nowhere. <br /> <br /> In short, a waste of talent and film.
