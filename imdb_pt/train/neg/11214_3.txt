I also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago. First, I'll say that sounds great. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic director of photography. I just wanted the movie to have been as good as it looks. I would not call it a horror movie. Putting some photos of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie. There is no mystery, there is no suspense, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what's going on with both sides of the entire movie. The acting was fine, I think, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the slogan, "Revenge can be deadly" ... really? ... they should check how many hundreds of horror / suspense movies have the exact same slogan? <br /> <br /> It hurts me to say a little bit of that, but I know a lot of people who worked on this movie, and I know they do not want people to smoke smoke their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
