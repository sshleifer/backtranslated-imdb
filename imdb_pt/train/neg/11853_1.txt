Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared to dramatic films (just look at the Oscar nominations each year). But still, the good ones are truly an art form. See "When Harry Met Sally," "Sleepless In Seattle," and classics like "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night." I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to build something that resembles a romantic comedy. But no one believes in the romance between the main characters, and there's nothing funny to make up for this big gap. Modine is far from being a protagonist - especially a romantic lead. I am sure that, as an Executive Producer, he had the means - but not the common sense - of launching himself. And Gershon ... I see possibilities for some comedic talent, but she had no script and a poorly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? Useless. <br /> <br /> Others have stated this, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly conceived, poorly executed; the actors are terribly miscast; and the characters, well, we just do not give a shit about them. <br /> <br /> An art form that is not. Will rent Moonstruck again.
