Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, excuse me ... treasure "protector", whatever that means) that descends from a long line of treasure hunters. One of their ancestors had received a clue to the whereabouts of a huge treasure that our founders, most if not all, Masons decided to hide because they did not want to fund their Independence so badly. <br /> <br /> The first clue reveals itself in a long lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his team, consisting of financier Ian (Sean Bean), the film Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal "Gigli") and two faceless minions, enter the cargo bay of the ship. They immediately pour tons of gunpowder all over the floor, not that this is significant in any way. Finally they find the lane (a skeleton is hovering over it) and ends up being a tube with the writing ... on it. Kind of. Do not ask me to explain. <br /> <br /> It's a riddle, and though his expedition is clearly irritated by not finding the treasure, Gates wanders around talking about the meaning of the puzzle in this frozen cargo hold while the crew just jaws fallen. I mean, come on. Someone should have been a little vocal in their disappointment of getting to the damn Arctic and finding nothing interesting, but they just stand there while Gates enters his own world, solving the puzzle. <br /> <br /> Next track turns out to be in the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is shocked. Several characters present an obvious exposure (get used to it). All this leads Ian's footman to pull a gun on Gates, and the gunpowder explodes in a big blast. (Oh, that's why they spilled all the gunpowder!) Huh !!) Ian and his henchmen make their escape, and Gates and the movie Dork Riley walk nine miles in freezing temperatures to an Inuit village in order to stop them . <br /> <To stop them, Gates concludes after trying the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley must steal it. Riley then tells Gates in excruciating detail why they can not steal the statement because it is so protected with metal and laser eyes and high-tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that there is an opportunity to steal him from the Preservation Room. Does Riley know what the Preservation Room is, Gates? "A place where they make jams and jellies?" I'm not kidding; this is the current line. Bartha also does not deliver a joke. So Riley does all this research on the Library of Congress and the Archives and water and sewage, but does not know what the Preservation Room is. This pretty much indicates the level at which this roadmap is. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this short, Gates, in fact, flees with the D of I, in a ridiculous invasion that could only happen in a movie. (I also hate the way they describe the technology of computer monitors in movies - filled with unlikely and impractical fonts and graphics.) Abigail Chase ends up accompanying for convenience, and as an obvious angle of "love interest." At one point, the three, running away from the law, discuss all of their plans high up in a clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates' father. played by a dyspeptic Jon Voight, takes the good guys and bad guys to a huge Indiana Jones amusement park, located under New York City. It's strange that subway builders have never found this thing. Gates and Senior Gates lead Ian into a wild chase. Ian believes they are stuck in a dead end and leaves them there. However, after they leave, Riley asks how they are going to leave. Gates ... <br /> <br /> oh boy ... <br /> <br /> presses a button and a door opens. No, really. One button, as they may have in a lavatory with vacuum flush in an office building. Good thing he knew where he was. Anyway, after a few more maneuvers, they find this huge treasure room (remember, this is all under Manhattan!) Full of all sorts of golden and historical things. Riley manages to deliver a really stupid line. Again. And the FBI officer, Harvey Keitel, forgives them, arrests Sean Bean, and allows the two chemistry-free halls to marry. <br /> <br /> For any viewer, I think it would be difficult to ignore all the exposure, the jumps. logic, and stereotyped characters for a long time. Although some of his exhibits involve good history lessons inserted in conversations at random times. I would like more conversations like this in my life.
