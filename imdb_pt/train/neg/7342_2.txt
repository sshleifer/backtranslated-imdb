"The Man In The Attic" is a film set in the 1910s. It is inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, it's a story that really did not need to be told. Looking at the box, the packers of the film did their best to make the film look steamy and erotic. They use terms like "illicit passion," "forbidden subject," and "unlimited pleasures." They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (little Doogie Howser, M.D.) holding a gun! <br /> <br /> The story involves Krista, played by Anne Archer. She is unfortunately married to a gentleman who owns his own business. Edward (Harris) is an employee of his husband's company. Krista and Edward end up falling in love with each other. The supposedly "shocking" part of the film is as follows: Krista's husband discovers the case and forbids them to see each other again. So what do they decide to do? Krista ends up making Edward live in the attic. Wow!! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward gets extremely jealous. So, and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> "The man in the attic" does not cover any new territory. It is an original photo of Showtime, which explains why the stars are a pair of actors from list B and both appear briefly in the chandelier. <br /> <br />
