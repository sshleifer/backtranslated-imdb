I'll just be vague about my potential to spoil the comments. There are enough canned plot elements in this film that is essentially pre-spoiled. <br /> <br /> This movie derives some ideas from a Southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. I suppose maybe TKOM has their ideas from some source ... anyway, after seeing this, you'll say, "Oh yeah, that's an imitation." <br /> <br /> I think the real fun thing about these McMovies is that once you've identified an element of the plot, it's figuring out if they will stick with the original, or will try to distort it. There are not many twists in this one.
