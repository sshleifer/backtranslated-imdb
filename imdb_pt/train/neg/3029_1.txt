From the first moment, this "thing" is just a horrible sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work. While the overall plot has all the potential for a thriller, the story is so poorly told that I can not afford it. From the middle of the movie, the characters' actions do not make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. For example, Ed's idea of ​​making Edna make coffee for them after firing her son's arm is well below her supposed experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams because of a telephone connection that has just been forgotten; should not she be suspicious for a long time that Williams is delivering them? Those FBI agents seem crazy to appear with only a single helicopter for something they have every reason to consider a mafia capital shootout. Moreover, what they do by holding back and leaking information to Cigliutti is practically an incitement to murder; it seems goodbye to justice if that's how the FBI does the investigations. In fact, they would have a messy case beyond repair if they did so. We started to see a car accident that would have at least seriously injured if it did not kill most of the passengers but miraculously leaves them all with only a few bruises. Quite the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco, which is from Domino's point of view in no way founded by previous events, but only by being drugged to the eyeballs. <br /> <br /> The entire sequence of scenes from Claremont's call, Williams looks exactly like a dramatic spectacle to me. This combined with horrible and uncomfortable camera work only makes one piece that I hesitate to call a movie. I'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors whose talent is out of the question.
