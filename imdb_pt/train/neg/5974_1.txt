Let me start by saying that this does not look or feel like a movie. It just seems like another TV show about hot girls and boys with no real movie language. <br /> <br /> The camera angles are so direct that the story is told in the simplest possible way, never making the audience connect with it. This film takes us where no movie I've ever seen has done before: to a realm where the Film Theater becomes a warm medium, giving the audience every element of interpretation. Very obvious. The big movie screen is used only as an enlarged TV, from which we can see all the attributes of these women in a way greater than life. <br /> <br /> Lately it seems that young directors are compromising the art of making movies. sales. This is very scary. The industry is spoiling art in the movies. We must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language really are. Not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a launch pad for young divas and athletes.
