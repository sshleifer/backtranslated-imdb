This was marked by potentially large matches being cut very short. <br /> <br /> The opening game was a waste of the Legion of Doom, but I think the only way they could have been eliminated by Demolition was a double-end. DQ. Otherwise, Mr. Perfect would have to work overtime. Kerry von Erich, the I-C champion, was wasted here. And this was the third consecutive ppv, where Perfect jobbed. Remember, before that, he never missed a match. <br /> <br /> The second game was very good, possibly the best of the night. Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent, while Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights, trapping the Honky Tonk Man. Koko B. Ware continued his tradition of being the first to make a new leap (remember Big Bossman and Yokozuna?). This was a foreboding of Bret Hart's singles career when he came back from two to one and almost survived the game. He and DiBiase made a wrestling clinic, making us forget that the starting point was DiBiase's boring contention with Dusty Rhodes. <br /> <br /> Although the Visionaries were the first team to have all of their surviving members (and only the second since 1987 to have four survivors), this game was not a squash. This was the longest game of the night, and Jake did a repeat of his performance in '88 when he stood alone against four men and dominated. I think he could have gotten a turnaround. These days, the game would have ended in reverse. <br /> <br /> One of the shorter SS games was also one of the most amazing. Possibly the most underrated wrestler of all time, Tito Santana was the inspirational fighter of the night, putting on a war paint and arresting Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even the Warlord in the final fight of survival. It was so strange to see him being so overwhelming, then back to his mediocre career. Sgt. Slaughter also did well, getting rid of Volkoff and the Bushwhackers, but that was no surprise. Tito went. <br /> <br /> I think the only point of the survival fight was to have Hogan and the Warrior together in the end. <br /> <br /> This show was boring and the matches were too much. low. The debut of the Undertaker was cool, but Tito Santana is the reason I will remember this.
