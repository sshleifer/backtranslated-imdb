Three lines of history and not enough tying them together, "Inside Man" was very nervous and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Despite having his moments, the film began to look like a quick thriller that quickly fell into a slow crawl, jumped quickly between ups and downs, and just barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes. I will credit Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full understanding of his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Clive Owen also did very well with his duality part as "evil genius" and "genius of crime" (both are not the same in retrospect). In general, each person individually created a large subsection. However, when the parties finally got together and everything counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or sum of all. It all ended with very little of the energy with which it began, with many plot holes, tons of questions, and as I said before, not near Spike Lee's normal level. I have to disagree completely with so-called "professional critics" .. This is not the movie they make.
