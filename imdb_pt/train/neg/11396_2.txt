The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that does not go straight to the Playboy Channel. "The Hazing" borrows a lot from everything that came before Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable ... just barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wood, the story is paper thin and the actors can not get out of a shopping bag. Put all that together and you'll have a straw for a movie. Sometimes when I'm bored I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is very similar. Chew it for 90 minutes and you get a strange taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
