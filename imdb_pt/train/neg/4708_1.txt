Oh gosh! The first time I heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was screaming like a jerk "JOHNY TEST" while playing video games. I thought he was confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life), and changing "Quest" with "Test." It's strange that I'm wrong, but actually I was wrong, he was not changing anything, he heard about this show. <br /> <br /> One day while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network would be released. What was the plot of this show, so I I ventured to watch it, and here is my answer "I want my shit HOUR BACK" (Because I watched this crap and "My Gym Partner is a monkey".) <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst shows that I've seen First, the beginning, with the most stupid music in the world, then the plot Oh, where are my ways I did not tell the plot of this show It's about a boy who has the amazing SMART SISTERS, who have a laboratory and experiment with his own brother.Hoh, now I see why his name is Johny TEST, he's the test of his sister s experiments. <br /> <br /> You know, I honestly miss Dexter's La b (before being transformed into NEW Dexter, total crap too). This is a bad copy of that good old program except that this show is unbelievably bad. Do not watch, do something more productive in that half hour than you watch this crap.
