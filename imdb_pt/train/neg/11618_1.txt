The acting in the film is really well done honestly, but the film is so slow and so annoying that as soon as it gets interesting, everything slows down. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in that, he did a great job, just like the other actors, like I mentioned, but man ... this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Now, maybe in short movie form this movie would be nice, but other than that, avoid it. This film has so much filler that it makes a Twinkie cake get jealous. <br /> <br /> I never, never, go out in movies, but seeing this at home with the family, I left. Yes, that was annoying. Apparently my comment does not have enough rows to post, so here's a little more filler. I think I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
