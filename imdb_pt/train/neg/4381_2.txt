Get to the point, this is one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not that they have not tried. There were some decent texts with some elements of structure, a good cast, a good performance. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went awry. <br /> <br /> Some of the elements may have been a bad structure and no substantive history, much exaggerated by leadership (which is probably much better when contained), some bad direction and editing. I had enough in about an hour, plucking my hair in about an hour and a half and very agitated in the hour and fifty minutes it ran. There was also insincerity about everything, being that I went with someone who used to be a heroin addict. He was agitated that glamorized something that had nothing good in it. This was reinforced by the beautiful 17-year-old girl who was in love with the 30-year-old junkie. <br /> <br /> And the frantic nature of leadership was enough. There were awkward plot points that were an attempt at a structure, but the end result was apathetic and endless (with unequal timelines). The characters were colorful but endless, which made me feel bad for quality actors that you have not seen enough. <br /> <br /> Jump. I assumed he was a first-time director in love with his own poop, but he's done it before. I'm intrigued about how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will really give them money.
