If you are watching this without an idea of ​​what the story is, then you are about to surprise. Even so, the synopsis painted an image of a very sensible storyline, but the film itself is nothing. <br /> <br /> As the synopsis is made, it talks about an obsessed climber, which you'll see as the prologue before opening credits and text crawl, which talks about the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to yourself? this means trouble with blinking lights), where its inhabitants are immortal yearning for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and notice of all this mountaineer's people, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating a clever sphere to meet man. <br /> <br /> Why was this translated? is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5-year-old could produce. Create forms, even if the credit goes to the stop motion style, and put it on a numbing loop. And repeat until your eyes begin to close, then move on to the next scene. If anything, Chonopolisians (if this term exist) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing in conjuring that magic sphere, and having a picnic playing with it before releasing it to the "other" world. It does not get better either, when the man interacts with the sphere in another hypnotically annoying and sleep-inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Thankfully the runtime is less than advertised, which is 57 minutes. (or less) against the 70 indicated. While firmly dated, its dull colors, non-existent history, scratchy soundtrack and repetitive images will not win fans. Do not waste time.
