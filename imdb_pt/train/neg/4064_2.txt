This movie is extremely annoying, tells the story of a gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting happens. The director really "kept real" and feels like a camera following a woman around while she lives her life. I had to watch other movies of this director for a class, the others were not so boring. This movie was also watched for a task ... worth the boredom with a good grade !! Overall, unless it is necessary, do not watch the movie. But do not disregard other films of this director, because they are not so bad ... and do not rule out other films about Africa, they are generally good, especially when done by a Western director.
