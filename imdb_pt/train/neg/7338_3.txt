I've been watching this movie hoping to find a beautiful and interesting story, but the plot was not good at all. The actors' game was no better. <br /> <br /> Of course Shahrukh Khan was there, but he was not enough to make this movie "credible" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this movie was based on Flaubert's novel "Madame Bovary", but for me I did not see it coinciding with the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> In general, we buy film to dream and have a good time, do not waste our time and change our mood for the worse. I just can not figure out how you could have such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8 / 10. So it's the kind of movie you should run away and ignore because there's nothing to appreciate in that! You will only waste your time, unless you enjoy "dark movie" with "strange and meaningless story".
