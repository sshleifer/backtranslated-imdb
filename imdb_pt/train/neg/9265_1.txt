Having listened to and appreciated Harvey Bernhard's commentary on Ovey II, I was shocked to discover that he too was behind this absolute piece of crap. It's like a very bad TV movie that you can glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too sick to reach for the remote. I think in the part where Michael Lerner is confronted with what I can only describe as a high school cast of Les Miserables my mouth was left open in disbelief. And then my mouth was rising and falling because I was laughing a lot. Dire I do not know why I have to write a minimum of ten lines, I have made my point briefly, there is nothing clever about all this modern verbiage.
