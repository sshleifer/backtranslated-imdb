In 1985 I got this thing (I can not even call it the movie) on the cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were out of control. I discovered early on that this was impossible. Stupid script (a bunch of old people hiring some youngsters to show them how to tag with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The abundant feminine nudity here kept my friend happy for a while - but even he was bored after 30 minutes. Remember - this was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY! That was back before nudity was so easy to get on the Internet and such. We kept watching waiting for something interesting or funny, but it never happened. The funniest thing about it was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted that this movie sucked! (A poster had a fictional review that said, "This is the best movie I saw this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer, in the lead, demonstrated some talent and started to have a career in the field. No budget and boring t & a. Skip this.
