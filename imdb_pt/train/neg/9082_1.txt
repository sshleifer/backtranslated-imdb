This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was fooled into thinking it might be good because some of my favorite actors are in it. Now I want to punch Jason Schwartzman for taking on that role. I was physically sick after watching this movie. I really do not understand Hollywood at times. There are so many people trying to invade that I'm sure you can get the best and get the best. That way, the worst movie you do is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of that mud. Jokes like the hair doll and shamelessly ripping jeans out have added to the film's lack of humor. Thankfully I avoided this movie and watched it on TV. This proves that you should avoid January releases at all costs.
