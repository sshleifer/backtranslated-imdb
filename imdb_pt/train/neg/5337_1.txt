There are so many negative comments about "Stay away Joe" here I can not stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen. Here's a side you have not heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's movies are my guilty pleasure for one simple reason: they are perfect movies for pure relaxation because I do not have to think when I watch them. That means I do not have to worry about losing a complex plot because there's never a proper plot to start with. I can just kick my shoes, get a beer, sit down, turn off my brain and enjoy all the melancholies and easy and easy rock 'n' roll songs of the most rainy decade of all. <br /> <br /> In my "Stay Away, Joe" books definitely falls into the "so bad it's good" category. Now, if you're like me and enjoy "the value of rubbish", this is the best camping experience of the 60's. It's so bad it's almost surreal to watch, and when you think it can not get worse, surprise you in the most imaginable. In the end, you get so impressed by all the new levels of stupidity that you just do not know whether to laugh or cry. In short: I love it because it's so fun that there was once a generation that actually made movies like this. I still give 1 in 10 - however, once it reaches bottom 100, it will become an instant classic of bad movies.
