When I started watching this movie, I was looking for some subtle metaphors, but it soon occurred to me that this movie was really about people on a train. Interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when, on occasion, there is a situation a little more interesting, the dialogue becomes flushed and boring. It's not that I do not understand how this movie is trying to portray the way people interact, is that in this movie they are very boring. If you want to see and analyze these types of relationships, it would be best to go out and buy a train ticket and see the people on the train with you. It's realistic but you would not go to a movie to watch a movie about you sitting watching the movie.
