Weakest entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard on paper. Funny joke and antics but not much plot. Barrymore has something to do as an inspector, changing guises to accompany Drummond, Algy and Tenny in a savage chase (mostly in circles, perhaps the budget was tighter than usual) to rescue poor Phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his disgrace. For those who are counting on this, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby's baptism. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fishermen to mingle with The Angler's Rest, but little of it rises above their foolishness.
