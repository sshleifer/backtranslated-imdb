Saving Grace is certainly one of the top contenders for the award "How to ruin a suitable movie in the last minutes". Of course, if you mix a quaint village in Cornwall - largely populated by gentle retired ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of foolishness will emerge. However, the last seven minutes of the movie go down to totally ridiculous and are not even redeemed for being particularly funny. It's a real shame because this comedy has the potential to be as good as that of 1998's Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a quaint little village and its eccentric inhabitants trying to get rid of a complicated situation. The protagonist of Saving Grace is Grace Trevethyn, middle-aged and widowed, whose legacy of bad debt from her husband forced her to make money in an unconventional way. Helped by her gardener, Matthew, she transforms her knowledge into horticulture into lucrative marijuana cultivation. Unfortunately, this leads her to a confrontation with local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . to whom all appear in their greenhouse simultaneously. The relationship and relationship between Grace and Matthew is well portrayed, and Brenda Blethyn leaves the viewer emotionally involved with her sympathetic character - you can really sense what she's going through. <br /> <br /> The cast of the smaller roles is excellent, even if some of them are a little strangely eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques, the trafficker, into Grace's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the film. And surely hydroponics is not a revolution in the world of cannabis cultivation? Unfortunately, the film changes soft humor for antics and ends up being as fake as marijuana plants.
