I'm going to say something to Jeanette and Nelson - even when stuck in a musical without joy, meaningless, painfully inept like this, there is still that glow in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is there, even when the material is paper thin. Even when the punctuation is practically disposable, nonexistent, depending only on some captivating melodies. And even when circumstances are so unbelievable - yes, even for a fantasy. To tell you the truth, she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real-life husband, Gene Raymond on SMILIN 'THROUGH, which, however, was a considerably better film. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but that's the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassed in her "hep" number with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come to an empty stare when faced with the most ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> You can only imagine what that was. as on Broadway in 1938. Certainly, it must have had more intelligence and style than is evident in this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton fails in a dull role and none of the supporting players can breathe any appearance of life in this mess. It's like amateur night in the studio, even with the few professionals scattered among the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> In short: Painfully awkward rendering of a Rodgers and Hart musical. I can not recommend it even to MacDonald and Eddy fans. And even though Jeanette's close-ups still sparkle with her gauze beauty, this movie is jaw-dropping.
