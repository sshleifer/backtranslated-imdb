It really confuses my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims that it is one of the worst horror films out there. This is not by far one of the worst, still not a good movie, but not the worst, however. Go see something like Death Nurse or Lake of Blood and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night Brings Charlie is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is much more than I can say for many extremely obscure horror movies. <br /> <br /> The film does not act on the deaths on the screen, there is a death where you see your pruning rip on one neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen does not mean that this is not a horror movie, just a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The film obviously should not be taken too seriously. The film arrived at the end of the second cycle of slasher, so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements, made in an ironic way. For example, after a death, Charlie goes up to the city's welcome signal and marks the population at one. This is something you can only laugh at. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy horror movies, definitely give this movie a look. It's slightly different from your usual horror movie with the possibility of two killers, but not much. The comedy of the movie is very beautiful telling the audience to relax and not take the film so seriously. You can forget the movie, you can remember it. I'll remember why I love the name.
