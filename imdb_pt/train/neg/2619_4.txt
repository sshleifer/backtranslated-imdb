It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It runs a bit slow at first, but ends up a flood of De Vil. The basic plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the adult movie is the talking bird that thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks like a human (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and beats like a dog. It's the comedy that the movie needed most. See it in the matinee so you do not have to pay the full price or wait for it to show up at Disney.
