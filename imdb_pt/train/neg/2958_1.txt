This movie was amazing. It is beyond appalling. I often meet with a group of friends and go to the movie store to find horrible movies to see their comic value. My friend suggested this, but as we watched, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish, just so I could say yes, but I could not. It's so bad. Horrible jokes, lame acting. The main characters are a clumsy dinosaur and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather watch The Postman than Costener twelve times in a row than see a fraction of that movie again. I think they try to deal with some dinosaur discrimination issues, but the part of the movie that really stands out is the dinosaur constantly knocking things over with their tail, and then laughing about it. That hurts. Watch if you are an aspiring masochist, otherwise leave this alone.
