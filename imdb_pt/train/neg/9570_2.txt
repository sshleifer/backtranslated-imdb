For the first time in years, I felt the need to enter IMDb today to wipe me out of this movie by writing a review because it was just a disappointment to watch. The storyline sounded amazing when I read, I expected a minimum mystery suspense, a claustrophobic ghost hunt. Unfortunately, everything is so weakened by a worldly and tiresome love story and by many liar movies that are strident and stupid - "no-one-says-things-so-except-in-bad-movies." Just agonizing. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick review of the worst offenses in this movie: <br /> <br /> - The script depends on both coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the movie. main characters that is laughable. No, actually, it's annoying. And lazy. <br /> <br /> Related to this: cheap emotions. A long parade "just in time" moments. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. All right, it seems the writer never experienced real humans in real life, but he gained all his knowledge of bad movies. So his characters are boring and lifeless second-generation cliches. They are mere plot devices, places without the least degree of personality. They are "man and woman in the breakup who still love each other." I've never seen this before except in 100,000 movies and it's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable. Think about the best two-dimensional Hollywood rate you have. There is no character in this movie that is remotely renovated, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - The vague and absurd resolution that oscillates very badly and needs only a jerk to fall, although the word "resolution" may be ill-fitting here, because the film is a marshy mess that will not no place at all. When you're done you do not care anymore. The last third of the movie I just made it fast, because it was so unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's it. Whatever the redeeming features of this film, everything is buried under incompetence. Do not watch that shit.
