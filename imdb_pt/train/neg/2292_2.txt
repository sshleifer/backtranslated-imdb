First of all I must admit Batman: The animated series is by far the best series of batman. We watched it when it used to be on TV. I did not know there was a fourth season. Not really. BTAS ends with Season 3, and should have stopped there. <br /> <br /> Why did they have to mess with a good thing? The catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible gray faces. The Joker looks beyond scary, it seems like every time they review their looks, it seems more and more scary. He does not seem to have more students, and now he does not even seem remotely human (though he is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy, who does the best batman. Although he now looks like superman. There is nothing to differentiate him, because both are alike, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night wing really needs a haircut, please! <br /> <br /> I've watched three episodes of Disc 1 in the series and I already think that this version is more violent and graphical (there is blood at all. episodes). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Batman: The animated series, there is not a season of Batman 4. They only included this series as the 4th season for marketing. If they just released it as The New Batman Adventures, I do not think many people would have bought it. <br /> <br /> Save the disappointment and continue with the seasons 1-3.
