This film is simply too long, very repetitive, with male nudity and sexuality (as it is called gay with my own collection of adult titles) very unnecessary and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the film could have been reduced to ten minutes and have been equally effective without experiencing the patience (and endurance) of an audience. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon. , with an audience of the film festival; the type of audience that tends to be more adventurous, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as one without much dialogue, short films, foreign films. The crowd almost exhausted in a theater of approximately 275 seats began to dribble in the first half of the movie and while the vast majority stayed for "pay" (which never really came), I never in about 14 years of watching any number of film festivals, experimental, gay or otherwise, saw such a large number of people move away from a movie. <br /> <br /> This film could easily have been cut by more than half and have been as effective as it was. It could also have gone in different directions, even with a shorter runtime, and have been much more effective. <br /> <br /> As it currently exists, this is not something that can be readily recommended or one that I would desire to watch again.
