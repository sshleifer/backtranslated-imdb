I'll dispense with the usual comparisons with a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New York personality, because, frankly, making comparisons with bewildered loser Josh Kornbluth is just an insult to any director. I will also avoid mentioning Office Space punctual satire at the same time as this celluloid catastrophe. Can I, however, compare him when I wake up during his own surgery? It is painful to watch and you wonder if the surgeons really know what they are doing. The Haiku Tunnel is the kind of movie you would like to have connected in its early stages of production. It was cruel to let him live and as a result, the public around the world is being driven to suffer. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie? Do you really have one ?? not worth discussing, but as a precaution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a temporary worker with severe phobia of commitment, is offered a permanent job. Your main duty is to send 17 high priority cards to your boss. But, ridiculously, he is unable to accomplish this simple task. My reaction? Great deal! Is not this a story? is a passing thought at best - one that should have gone through any worthy filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The lead actor? if you can call it so ?? is a clumsy clown of a man with chubby features, a receding and untamed scalp, and a series of facial expressions ranging from shivering to disturbing. Where's the director found that asshole? What do you say ??? He is the director? Oh my mistake. Throwing yourself into your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing, but I suspect Mr. Kornbluth is not as convincing as a human being, let alone an actor. Rest assured, this is by no means a murder without character, but never before have I been so irritated by the presence of an actor onscreen! My frustration was further confused by her incessant monologues between the scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needed a little intelligence to understand this nonsense, Kornbluth insults us even more, "explaining" the action (first rule of the cinema: "dramatize the exhibition", "do not show"). Who does this guy think he is? He has no charisma, no charm, and, judging by the Hawaiian shirts, he has no sense of style. Your casting agent must be shot at point-blank range! <br /> <br /> The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt, with one exception. Patricia Scanlon makes a very funny presentation as Helen, the former secretary, who has gone mad about her former boss, and makes disturbing phone calls in her basement while holding a flashlight under her face. It made me laugh with myself, but the moment soon passed and I was back to check my watch for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is also a misnomer. The Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the old form of Japanese poetry. Do not kid yourself thinking it's an art film because of its pretentious title or the fact that it only touched a handful of theaters and did not make money at the box office ?????? there is a good reason for this! <br /> <br />
