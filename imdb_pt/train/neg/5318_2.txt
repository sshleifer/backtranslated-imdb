Well, I had to be generous and give this a 2. This was mainly due to the free holes cut into that lady's shirt where her breasts are. I found this kind of fun. Other than that, this movie does nothing more than provide some good laughs with a friend. Funny if you are willing to throw comments on "mystery science theater" with someone, but it is not better than a 2. And a 2 practically sucks.
