The Christmas Secret was presented as a wonderful film, but I was really disappointed. They even sold copies of VHS and DVD of the movie when it was over, which leads me to think that the producers were really proud of this project. As a film actor, I felt that most of the performances were made, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not put this film on my otherwise excellent resume. It was an embarrassment. I had been a fan since the days of Waltons, but I could not get rid of any of his subsequent works, so poor was that offer. <br /> <br /> In defense of the actors, the direction was blistering, mechanical, and completely amateur. <br /> <br /> I hope this is not considered a rancorous criticism and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic. I called the movie because I had a good cast and I was ready to enjoy the movie. However, I would challenge anyone out there to watch this movie and not wish their money back even if it was on Tv.
