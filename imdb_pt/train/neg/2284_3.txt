Now, I will not deny that when I bought this off of eBay, I had high expectations. This was an incredible print job out of the master of comedy that I so much enjoy. However, I was soon disappointed. Apologies to those who liked it but I just found Compleat Al to be very difficult to watch. I have some smiles, of course, but most of the funny came from music videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest was basically stuffing. You could say that this was not Al's biggest video achievement (this honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I doubt this will make the jump to the DVD, so if you're an ultra-hardcore fan of Al and just HAVE to own it all, buy the tape from eBay. Just do not pay too much for it.
