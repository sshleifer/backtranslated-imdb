To live! Yes, but not kicking. <br /> <br /> True story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station made an announcement that it would show off a new reality show. A yes contest. The main participant in this program would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to a lucky person with progressive kidney failure. Really. <br /> <br /> The country and the international media were everywhere in this story, like flies on a dung, saying it was horrible, immoral, what is this world coming, and things like that. In a way, I had to agree. Over the months, tension has grown to a point where the government was busier about whether they should let this program happen or not instead of running the country. <br /> <br /> The show aired until the very last moment they were advancing. And until the last moment the country was on the warpath, the prime minister making speeches, all newspapers writing on the subject, everyone in the country holding their breath. And the network moved on. To a new frontier on television. And they definitely managed to do just that. They shoved the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she could live while she died soon after. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show, it was revealed that it was a partial farce. The woman was not ill, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, which, with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions, accumulated for months to a fantastic climax, was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of great deficiencies of organ donors. The man who founded this particular network died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now, this is television. Leaving everyone behind with astonishment. <br /> <br /> Do not give me a badly directed and misdirected movie about a woman trying to get a Russian roulette show on American TV. <br /> <br /> if. <br /> <br /> Spoiler As if I would believe they would get it through the FCC. As if I were to believe that it would pass through the US Supreme Court on the basis of freedom of speech. As if I were to believe the ridiculous ending where this woman got and had trouble of conscience because a guy killed himself in the air. <br /> <br /> Everything has been done before. Watch Running Man with Arnold instead. At least it had a very good ending. <br /> <br /> Spoiler This is a terribly bad piece, along with a ridiculous ending. So she gets shot at the end, does that make us go to the movies and feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? Do not believe me, but I would say: leave this alone and observe a test pattern, you will have more quality.
