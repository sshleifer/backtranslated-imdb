Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that prevented me from giving this horrible photo that I (1) deserved. (Incidentally, loyalty to Mr. Falk was what kept me watching this movie all the time, from head to toe.) Even if you have forgiven all the glaring errors, this was simply the worst excuse for a TV show . I'm glad I watched it on TV for free, I would have hated to have spit out the dollars for an impression.
