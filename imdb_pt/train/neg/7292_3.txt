Sunshine is a European import into Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it is the epic story of the Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, then it is prosperous, it becomes ascending, it changes name and hopes to assimilate itself in Hungarian society, so that successive generations can advance professionally. The story is told by the eyes of the eldest son in each of the three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who have lost World War II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life does not work very well. <br /> <br /> Sunlight is being hailed as an artistic success, but it is a missed opportunity. The plot, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with voice-over narration and news footage. The 'plot' of the family moves from a predictable event [ie. the Habsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next, with little continuity, depth or detail. The issue of Jewish assimilation is blurred, and important sub-themes [the "secret" diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility are to the end. Alternatively, filmmakers provide continuity of generation using common incest / infidelity themes. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance, but his performance is far from being an award-winning material. The cast format "3 for 1" is a distraction from the viewer and looks more like a cheap movie trick than a good theater. Sunlight is basically the Hungarian material of the "History Channel". It has the appearance of Winds of War, with Forrest Gump being turned into Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
