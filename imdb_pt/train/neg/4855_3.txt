I really wanted to like this movie, but I ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera powered by a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, of course, unstable. But then the rest of the film remains in shakycam mode, even during silent moments of conversation, to the point of ridicule. Are the rental houses without tripods and Steadicams? The fact that it was filmed in 16mm does not help, since the whole film is grainy and unstable. <br /> <br /> For all the effort that Bigelow invested in precise vehicles and equipment, there are enough mistakes and inconsistencies that undermine the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - A car would not explode in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee would not be driving through Baghdad in 2004 but would be supported by other vehicles in case of collapse or attack. - It would be unlikely unlikely to be able to hit an insurgent running long distance, where the bullet is clearly taking more than a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> I believe the bombs were taken to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not at some random spot in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - It is said that the tanker's attack occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that suffered very few internal attacks. The area is mainly composed of offices and palaces with few residences but is portrayed as a dangerous maze of dark alleys and insurgents lurking. Strangely, James never gets into trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering the two companions to take each of them alone, thus establishing the attempted abduction. <br /> <br /> - Speaking of which, the 3-man team is always portrayed cleaning up buildings, chasing insurgents, etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to face a dead insurgent hanging out the window to find out he is not faking it? <br /> <br /> There was no shot to show viewer that the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was in relation. I had no idea who the EOD team reported, and no other character was revealed. These are things the characters would know, so should we. <br /> <br /> Many of the "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will have problems with the Iraqis he is trying to move on, that the choice of cereals at home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you have kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle. Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenaline. It's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What is the point? <br /> <br /> If this is really the best so far of the Iraq war films, it's a lot of pity. Just based on the half hour I saw, I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO instead.
