Spoiler below but read on or you'll never know the horrible fate that awaits all plans to rent "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a moonlit night, in a remote research lab, a breakthrough medical is about having deadly results. A chemical compound created to "hunt and destroy" deadly cancer cells leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system to the building's basement. Now the rodents involved in the upstairs laboratory experiment are not the only mice in the facility that will become the altered species. Professor Schultz, a leading biologist, has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme now allows its "hunt and destroy" formulation to regenerate for the time needed to neutralize the deadly cancerous tumors. When three different grades of the new blend are given to three different mice and the rest is dumped in the faulty "Waste Hazard" sink, shocking side effects result in a night of terror ..... right ..... <br /> Seriously, this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen this year. All about it shouts "Low budget!" From the horrendous acting to the special effects that are some of the worst I have ever seen. The characters are stupid cliches and act stupidly and predictably: walking alone through dark corridors, looking for a cat, stumbling and falling so that the "rats" can reach them, lodging in a small room, etc. <br /> While some movies are cheaply made, this movie really takes the cake. All possible corners are cut off, since reusing previous footage, filming the "Lab" aisles from different angles to make it look bigger (This reminds me - why were only TWO guys working on this huge building?!?!?!? ), music and special effects that could be made on a children's workshop PC. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the worst aspect of this smoky dung heap - the special effects. Just horrid. Computer-generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene, so even the most fanatical movie fans can see they're computer-generated. And that giant mouse suit - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! Seriously, are we supposed to believe this damn baby is a monster? Just unfortunate ........ On the better side, some of the gore looks really cool especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> All the actors are terrible. no one involved with the production cared or knew what he was doing. I lost enough time with the review, just take my advice, it's crap. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About the DVD: The transfer is a drug, the audio is acceptable and there is a track of comments on the director's disk and two of his friends who claim to have absolutely nothing to do with it. making the film, but they were there to ask questions and make comments. All three of these primordial subhuman muds are so incredibly stupid that they must be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I do not want to waste more than the time of you or my reader as I am beginning to remember more than I want about this movie ..... DVD rating: 1/10.
