About twenty minutes after that movie, I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were pretty boring. Occasionally, something pleasant would happen, but then things would subside again. Fortunately, my patience ended up being rewarded, and the end of this movie was not bad at all. However, it was not good enough to justify the session in the first ninety minutes. So I would say the film was mediocre in general, and considering all the talent in the cast, I would call it disappointment.
