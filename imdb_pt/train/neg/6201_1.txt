I saw that. It's not "good" but interesting in a low-key way. The boys are quite naturalistic, but ................ the collective / gratuitous final collective rape scene is disgusting and-oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of World War II scenes is offensive the way he tries to compare the real horror with this misogynistic invention. Real atrocity is real, this movie is just atrocious. However, the film has an appearance that can draw you. But it seems to me that it is the "New Clothes" of the Emperor, but in fact in reverse. The film looks good, but the direction, the story, the content and the final feeling you take from this movie is empty. If a feeling can be empty, that's it.
