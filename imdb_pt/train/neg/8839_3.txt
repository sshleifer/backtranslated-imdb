Good attempt and good ideas (redemption of the prostitute, humans helping each other, ...) but a bad result ... The director obviously tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung recreating an environment that should portray Vietnam ... The only problem is that Vietnam has long gone and when "The smell of green papaya" had a history ... trying to design this kind of environment (muffled sounds and the slow pace of life ...) in modern days leaves a false sense. In addition, it quickly creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang, because it is there that Harvey Keitel, a former Marine in the film, was probably stationed during the war ... But in the south of Vietnam nobody or very few people speak with the northern accent clip shown by the actors ... Seriously strange even for a bad Vietnamese speaker. old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful (not a disease for people of his condition), a peasant who knows how to read and write elaborate Vietnamese poetry, ... even more dubious ... /> <br />
