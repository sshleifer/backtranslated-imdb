Yes, I admit that I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing that I could not help crying. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) did it again. First, have the Million Dollar Man (former professional wrestler) on your show, and now this. <br /> <br /> The Omega Code follows a stream of religion-oriented films. It was a lot of fun, but at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate. The film follows what is known as "the Bible code" instead of following the actual biblical scriptures. This movie is extremely poorly made; from his writing to his directing to his hilarious and horrible performance. It's depressing that people really do struggle in this movie. It looked more like a late-night movie that someone was watching on the US channel or a straight home video instead of a movie released in theaters. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you do not watch this movie, even if your life depended on it.
