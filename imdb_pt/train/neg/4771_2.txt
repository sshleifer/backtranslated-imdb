Do not waste your time on this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the most ridiculous I've ever seen. I seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the production of this movie could have looked at that final scene and thought, "yeah! Now there's an end!" and patted him on the back. To me, it seemed more that they ran out of ideas! They built the final scenes to have a cool touch, but instead, they let all the buildup fall on your face. When the last shot went out and I heard the credit song beginning, I was in shock - I could not believe what I was seeing and that someone might even call it the end. The best thing anyone could do with this movie is to rewrite the ending and give it some substance. Seriously, I'd really love to have anyone come up with that in a room, look in their faces and say - WTF ?? !
