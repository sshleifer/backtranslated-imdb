I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented the Blockbuster DVD .. Actually, I know one of the movie actresses .. I will not tell anyone ..! (This is kept secret ..) But I must admit, it was not as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini? Hats down to this guy .. But it's a shame he was not in the movie for long .. What the film lacks is the idea, the script, sound, etc. It may sound like a good movie .. but it was not. That's fun .. Well, I'm glad my sister paid Â£ 10 to rent 3 DVDs from Blockbuster .. I chose this .. and I was disappointed . Anyway, thumbs down for me ..! It's not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
