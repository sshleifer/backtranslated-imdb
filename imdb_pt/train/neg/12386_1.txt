It's hard to make an unbiased judgment about a movie like that that had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is undoubtedly the worst kind of film exploitation. I had the misfortune to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever. I saw her again earlier this year and was horrified again. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fanatic or one to say what others should and should not see, but I really offended the way something as horrible as the rape was dealt with in this movie. I love lowbrow cinema, but that's just unpleasant. Rent some Rus Myer instead.
