I did not see the original, but I just wanted to make a quick note to anyone coming down here: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or go back in time to warn me not to see it. <br /> <br /> I'll give you two positive nods: The sarcasm of Cage's character at least has a few laughs from me and the island's landscape was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here come the mockery. The plot of the movie is only pushed forward because the other characters are not going to give Cage any direct response - and he accepts it !!! How could it last more than an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to populate a library. How could anyone read this script and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this obscure outline of what a movie should be" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie. Or even rent it on DVD.
