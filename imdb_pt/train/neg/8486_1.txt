I can not believe anyone thought there was something original or interesting about this movie. I'm a science fiction fan as much as the next kid, and I can enjoy even old movies with ridiculous premises as long as they're written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my brilliant review of Altered States [1980].) <br /> <br /> A monkey could have explained better exactly why I should, for a second, take seriously the basic idea behind this movie. The problem is not that the producers had a low budget - they did not care. <br /> <br /> Now, publicly humiliate the worthless magazines whose brilliant comments appear in the box: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (Actually, I like to read the last two. Reviewing the credibility went by the word, but I know that if I ever make a handheld movie, stupid effects, I'll show those journalists and I'll remember what they said about Conceiving Ada.)
