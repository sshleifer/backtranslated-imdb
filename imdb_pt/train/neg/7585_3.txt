I love watching colorful movies in the first place - do you mean that those 40's outfits were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this film. Her "eccentric" outfit is actually quite attractive and yes, she has an incredible hourglass figure. But I feel she gave him too much head. She probably developed this characterization over many presentations, and no one told her, "If you give a chuckle, leave it out." She deceives herself too much when she should be surprisingly on earth. Madame Arcati's joke is that mediums were generally depicted as women in long, loose suits. Arcati behaves like a retired director (we're really going to put our backs on her!). The contrast between his jovial, everyday manner and his crazy beliefs is not really revealed. Just because all the actors are English (except Cummings), Americans feel they need to use the words "Brit", "stiff", "lip" and "upper." Oh, take your time! The three main characters lose heart constantly and make spicy comments (Did he make love to you? Yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).
