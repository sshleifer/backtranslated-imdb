I created my own reality coming out of the theater where my girlfriend was tied to go to this place with her mother. We (my friend and I) left about an hour. What a load of pseudo-scientific jargon new age. <br /> <br /> Sub atomic particles are thoughts? When engraving labels on water bottles and blessing him by a Buddhist monk, did he grow small crystals? A 25% drop in homicide rate in DC occurred when a group of people meditated. Wow, what a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure someone ate cheerios for four days in a row for the same amount of time. Should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the homicide rate? <br /> <br /> Hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! <br /> <br /> BTW - It was funded by the cult Ramtha, whose leader was one of the "experts" who were interviewed by the filmmakers. There are no ulterior motives here, right?
