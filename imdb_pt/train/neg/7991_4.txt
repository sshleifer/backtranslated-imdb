Paint by numbers the mediocre story and performance saved by some authentic color - and some moments that are truly wonderful and deeply felt. He effectively captures a girl's delicate transition into adulthood, and deals in a very sensitive and inventive way with the cultural conflict the main family experiences. Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is trapped in a target and extremely complicated plot that succeeds in incorporating religious conflicts, a conflict over a road construction project, the sexual life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the forest, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the ins and outs of local church politics, and so on. And not all of this includes the actual central plot, which is just about the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was really shocked when I realized that the whole thing was supposed to happen over the course of a summer (and that much film was made in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is melodramatic, every O point is predictable, important life-altering events happen and are forgotten 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely unpleasant. Most shocking is the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable "turnaround") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced only to die a few minutes later and provide another "twist". It's all totally mechanical, to the end that ties up all the loose ends (well, not all of them, just the ones the movie thinks you care about).
