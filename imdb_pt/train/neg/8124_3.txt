The film that films scenes from a tour of scenic caves. <br /> <br /> Do not remember anyone in this movie, except Michael Pataki, who exposed extreme pain like JC in "Five the Hard Way." He's the really annoying sheriff I cheated on when he practices the truncheon on our angry doctor. Probably most of the laughter you'll get is with Dr. Beck's epileptic seizures. Could Mrs. Beck be more wood? Seriously, if you took a 4-foot branch, stick it in a hot tub, you would not be able to tell the difference. The fear and suspense is to look at the clock thinking when the credits will roll. Watch as a late night movie, MSTified, but do not get out of your way.
