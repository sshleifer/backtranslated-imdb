This is a piece of s - t !! this looks worse than one made for t.v. movie. and I come to think that a sequel was even perceived and the results ... the war is more beautiful than that. jean claude van shame did it again and he wonders why his career is where he is now. no script, no story and no time should be wasted on it. I mean that. 1 out of 10 is too high, too high. Goldberg must be hammered into it. van shame is not an actor.
