Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth episode of the series Nightmare on Elm Street and again another bad sequence. I think this is connected with the last sequel to Dream Child. I was fortunate enough to get the DVD of the Nightmare on Elm Street series box for my birthday so I could watch all the sequels. I can say that I am getting more and more disappointed with these sequences, at least in the last two, it seems that Freddy has lost his advantage. It's almost as if the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that was not needed, sorry to Robert Englund, but that was far below what Freddy Krueger represents. <br /> <br /> Freddy is back, but he has something we do not know, a daughter. Maggie, she is not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants his help. She has to do her best to resist her powers, but it is difficult with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic, is not it? But Freddy is not giving up without manipulating her in her ways. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Notice the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it's linked to the fifth installment of the series Nightmare on Elm Street, I'd rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This only had bad acting, stupid editing and just a bad idea for a story. I did not like the concept and it ended up ruining the whole idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger really is, the death master of nightmares, not Father Knows Best. <br /> 2/10
