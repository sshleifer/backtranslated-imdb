I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued. A woman who one day finds herself driving in her own car. Well, I thought, that might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it's not. First, the title. The broken? The broken ... what? What is broken? The ... oh, wait ... I get it, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, clever! Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only thing that's going to happen. <br /> <br /> The premise is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland did a lot better at 'Mirrors'. A cross between Invasion of the Thieves of Bodies and Mirrors, and a bit mediocre in that. A more appropriate title would be "The Boring" as it attracts all scenes to bloody ages. Or perhaps "The Confusing," since it explains absolutely nothing, either in the narrative or in the story itself, only a vague idea about copies of evil and something, dotted with scares and cheap scenes used to death, but nothing palpable. It's just a mess. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting and special effects are very good, but again, it's not a difficult role to take action. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I still feel dissatisfied, maybe a bit confused, and not EA Poe or Stephen King type. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this one. Simply put, there are better thrillers out there.
