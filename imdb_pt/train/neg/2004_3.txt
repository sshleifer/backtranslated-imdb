I read the book a long time ago and do not specifically remember the plot, but remember I liked it. Since I'm sick at home on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It's a life movie. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with actors and actresses of the B series. <br /> <br /> The female cast is in the movie Desperate Housewives. I've never seen the show, but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the gist. Is there nothing more original? Of course, but not in life. The male cast is pretty effeminate, but the girls need husbands, I suppose. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a woman is struggling with a male, for her life, and what does she do ??? Kick him in the testicles. What else? Women love it, but let me tell you something for the girls ... It's not as easy as it's always meant to look. <br /> <br /> It was not all bad. I got the creeps once or twice, so I have to give credit to someone with that.
