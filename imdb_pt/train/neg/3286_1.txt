I do not understand why doing remakes became the trend. Every remake I've ever seen is horrible, and that's no exception. If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones, which is "despicable" garbage, he is right. Why would they bring a wonderful television show that I loved, never missed an episode, and the seasons 1-4 itself on DVD, and ruin it, I'll never know. The television show was a family show and although Daisy has the body, he was actually flaunted, or even approached at the show, to save the clothes. A family gig was turned into dirty trash, and I would not recommend anyone to see it. Another thing I did not like was that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely cute. The new Bo and Luke are not at all cute. This was one of the show's drawers. The cast is terrible. They could have at least gotten a brunette for Daisy. I do not think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg. All the other roles he has played are totally opposed to this role. The only role they got in half way is Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but it's still not a comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor himself, and that made him perfect for the role. I think the cast is horrible, the story is horrible, and it all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty and terrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to go see it. I just saw this out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket on the 4th season DVD. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
