I've never commented on IMDb before, but I feel like I have to after watching the Batman animation. Your absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had the perfect animated series in Batman in the early '90s, so what the hell are they doing trying to tinker with the winning formula? I feel like writing a letter of complaint to the WB. The original animation was somber and shocking, just as Batman should be. WB had to ruin everything with a bit of Batman of the Future. Now they produce this nonsense. The Joker does not remotely remember the Joker from DC Comics. DC should process. I ask everyone to agree to send me email or write to WB and use the power of people to retrieve the original formula
