I really despised this movie when I saw it about 6 or 7 years ago, as I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. Even this. This complete rubbish ruined Robin for me for a long time. I'm just recovering recently with his funny but serious part on Father's Day, but then he went on to create another bug, Bicenintinial Man, I think it was called, but the point is. Robin should have been getting much better jobs now and now he has run the slime that originated with this 'classic' again.
