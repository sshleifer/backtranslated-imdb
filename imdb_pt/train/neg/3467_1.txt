The cover of this film is named after Kyle Minogue, but it has the same fate as Drew Barrymore did in "Scream". This is the first thing that makes this movie lame; they are trying to market a movie with someone who is in it for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Of course we have to have this movie with young university students who do not know that there is a murderer out there. To top it all off, Molly Ringwald of the 1980s teen movie fame is the star of this beautifully written film. It's a good career move for Molly to make some money by making a low-key movie in Australia so she will not be ridiculed in the United States. <br /> <br /> Either way, this stupid movie is about some stupid horror movie that was never finished because this idiot creature kills everyone in it. Throughout the film, we must guess who the killer is. To shorten the story, remember our little friend Molly, she saves the day ... or her? <br /> <br /> This move is simply bad, rent it if you feel like torturing yourself or simply breaking it walk from your local video store if you see it on the shelf. Do not spread the horror.
