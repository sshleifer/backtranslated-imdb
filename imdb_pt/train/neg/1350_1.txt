This film deals essentially with the arch-enemy Doctor Claw, of Inspector Gadget, who returned after many years to the now peaceful city of Metropolis. Claw's plan is to thwart Gadget once and for all, using a "cooler" crime fighter to help destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately the film failed miserably, the series was great, but was revived almost 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, this simply does not work; Dr. Claw is not only visually less scary, but looks more like a fighter with a cold than his original bullied self. Granted this is a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (heaven forbid I mention the animation) that pales in comparison to the original series. Someone decided to update Penny also to bring her two decades to speed, she now has a style of almost-punk rebel clothes and does not play half the role she did in the TV series. Gadgetmobile speaks, in addition to including a plot angle that focuses on whole talking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the show who is tired but I found the live-action version was more painful than I could endure but now they go and make that series of quality movies on us. It's more than I can handle.
