A disappointing film, I would say: the performance was blistered, somehow. In many cases, I simply could not feel that the facial expressions corresponded to the words spoken or to the intent of the scene. An angry character (or sad, happy, frustrated) should make the viewer believe that he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). It does not happen here. <br /> <br /> The comment about the writers assuming that you already know the characters was fit. They do things and say things that come out of nowhere: the character Andrew accuses the parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; then he explodes and leaves furiously, telling his father: "Do not touch me, you f ***!". Perhaps, if we had seen the prequel, we understood where all this comes from, but there is no prequel, so we are a little at sea as to reason! <br /> <br /> A strange and peculiar thing that Andrew does is go to an old quarry, sit on the edge overlooking the "still water" below; then he reaches into his pants pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and lights one. He did the same thing three times during the film; I think we should see this as a tortured act of being alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It may have been four times, I've lost count. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is the fact that he recently discovered that it is adopted; this happens very early in the movie, so there is no dramatic change he might be suffering because of this discovery. It is not very clear whether this is why it is so bitter or whether it is about something else. <br /> <br /> I think there's a kind of Lynchian feeling in the movie, but should a novice director really be trying to climb a mountain so early in his career?
