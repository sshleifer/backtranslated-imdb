This is definitely not one of the best Lucius Fulci films by any stretch of the imagination. The plot is very bad, a millionaire is murdered and his spirit calls his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with this (besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie) was wondering why anyone should care? The father is a great idiot to everyone he met (including the daughter he asks to help him), which made it very difficult for anyone to care who killed him. But no one really watches a Fulci movie for a good storyline, to do that would be like watching an incredible screenwriting porn by writing and acting. Normally, his films try to make up for it by adding excessive blood footage, but even that is missing in this movie. If you're looking for a good Fulci movie, check out The Beyond.
