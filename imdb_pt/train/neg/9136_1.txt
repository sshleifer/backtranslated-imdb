When the movie started, I was shocked to see it was filmed using a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the average home movie. Even direct to DVD movies should have better production values ​​than that! Heck, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values! All too often, the movie seems to be done by recording the camera on a tripod and turning it on - no camera! Closeups and anything that looks like camera work are missing in some scenes where they may have worked and in others there are too many closes or badly framed. Yes! <br /> <br /> The movie is about two gay men who want to get married. As if it had been done almost a decade ago, her only option was to get married in Vermont - times have definitely changed. However, the recent acceptance of gay marriage can in no way be attributed to this film - if anything, it has put back gay marriage supporters instead of helping while the film stinks and never really tries to seriously address the issue. According to the film, religious people are one-dimensional idiots who carry Bibles EVERYWHERE and shoot people, just as wives who have gay husbands are shy when they find out that their spouses have lived as liars. I'm sure it gives an honest chance to both sides on the subject! <br /> <br /> The end result - nothing about the movie shows any professionalism and I even hesitate to call it movie. It's more like a home movie and does not even deserve a IMDb listing or even an inclusion in the Bottom 100 list of the worst rated films of all time. The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the direction (if any) is awful, the camera work is awful and the plot is horrible. It's a home movie !! There's nothing positive I can say about it anyway, except that it makes Ed Wood movies look like Oscar contenders in comparison and I'm sure Mr. Wood's ghost is smiling every time someone watches this mess! <br /> <br /> I do not care if you're gay or hetero - this movie is not worth your time and I do not know how they managed to create DVDs of it. I assume one of the actors burns them on their home computer during their free time! Seriously, that gives a new meaning to the word 'bad'! <br /> <br /> By the way, if the only lady in the movie was a real lawyer, would not reading be an important prerequisite? I'm just saying. <br /> <br /> Finally, with gay marriage being such a serious and important subject, can not we have a movie that is BETTER than THIS that addresses the issue? This, unfortunately, only invites the laughter.
