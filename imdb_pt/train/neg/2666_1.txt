Honestly, if someone has a brain, there is not a positive thing to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> I lost my $ 1 renting it. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith by saying "If you have a dream, you have to protect it." <br /> <br /> All actors must have been bored or had no fame at the time. even Matthew Mc Conahay * however you spelled * was better than all the actors in this movie when he played a psychopath in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this movie and have something good to say, your IQ should be extremely low , with such bad taste in the movies, it hurts. Thank you ... and the TRUTH has been spoken! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Take the Devil's Rejects, now it's a classic.
