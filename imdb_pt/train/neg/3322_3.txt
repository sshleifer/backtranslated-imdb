Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I ever saw was "42nd Street". So I hoped all his things would be so good. I discovered that it was not necessarily the case, even here, with my favorite James Cagney actor of the Classical era. <br /> <br /> Oh, the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as ever, but the story is like many others and quite tiresome. They always seem to involve screaming and unhappy program producers. In this movie, it's Cagney who ends up screaming things so often that he gives me a headache after a while and his character wears off ... fast! <br /> <br /> Even the songs here are anywhere near "42nd Street" class, songs that you could sing for years and years - decades, I would say. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of Cagney's earliest films - and Berkeley films - I do not like much and was very disappointed to watch.
