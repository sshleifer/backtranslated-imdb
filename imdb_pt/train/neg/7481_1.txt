Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her teenage career was over thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films released in years, an unmistakable disaster in which the two leaders indulge in a frenzied display of their branded tics in an effort to make up for a bad roadmap and bad direction. This thing should have been stifled at birth. <br /> <br /> I hope John Cleese was paid for having his name associated with this disaster. He is the only artist who has walked through this stinking mess more or less unscathed, being his only fault not realizing that the rest of the cast would sink the scene.
