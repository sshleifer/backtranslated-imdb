I think I watched this movie, but do not cite me, because I may have fallen asleep during the observation, since it did not "grab my excitement and imagination". At least I know I've watched enough to know that I will not be watching again anytime soon. Or always. <br /> <br /> Eita, talk about lame ... Really lame. Totally limp. Neither would appeal to a child of six years. Basically, it did NOT have a dramatic impact. Zilch Nothing. Only shlock turned into dreck. Comedy? Should this be comedy? You could fool me - ee-ee ...! Now, if the aliens were insanely carnivorous like in the movie "Critters," we could have made the human characters do something a bit deeper than being overly presumptuous ... like screaming and screaming for their lives so that they are not eaten, then the story could be something more exciting than watching paint dry. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about watching this. Not worth the effort. You can find something more interesting to do. How to watch the paint dry. Or fall asleep.
