This movie does not offer ANYTHING to anyone. Does not succeed on any level. The acting is horrible, boring wordy dribble. They, obviously, by the length of the final sex scene were trying to be shocking, but ended up being pretty much a parody of what the movie intended. Complete trash, I can not believe what laughable movie this was. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this movie because she thought it would be the hit indie hit, an NC-17 movie. The problem is that no adult will get this movie while the movie unfolds as an uninteresting OC episode or something geared toward teenagers. Pathetic.
