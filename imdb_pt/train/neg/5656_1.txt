Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. This is just a superposition of scenes without a clear connection. The action is also very bad despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El allayli. But something is really amazing in this film, talking about sexuality, women's emancipation, nudity scenes are very rare in Arab cinema even today. I really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in the Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that led me to vote for this movie as being lousy are not only scenery and acting, but also lack of professionalism. This movie looks like an amateur. We can see many errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabian film, it is not recommended. But if you want to encourage uncensored movies across the Arab world, watch and make your friends and family do the same.
