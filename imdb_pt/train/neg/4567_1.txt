What a poor image of professional police officers is displayed on television watching this supposed reality show. One can only hope that reasonable real suspicion leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a "stop", then the "Pat Down" on the outside of a clothing, then be able to articulate why the officer got into someone's pocket and got the contraband, was cut off from the scenes, because if it was not, the prison in most places would be thrown if they got a supervisor. An account of a warrant does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant, unless the person who is dispatching has the original warrant in hand. If the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout, it is good enough for a stop, but that does not necessarily mean that the warrant is still in effect. Since I have not seen a Dis-claimer from CBS (I may have lost), CBS could be in trouble.
