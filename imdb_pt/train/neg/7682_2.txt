Presented in 1955, COBWEB is a star of all stars, from silent film veteran LILLIAN GISH to the progeny SUSAN STRASBERG. Situated in an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this movie about you wonder ...... high drama? Doctor and patient relationships? Treatment of shock therapy? No, this bug is about who exactly will be able to choose the curtains for a psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm joking? You will not believe your eyes as you watch this unbelievable plot that has been turned into film! Progressive shrinking head Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants to have all hospital patients involved in the design, selection and execution of the new curtains required. McIver's wife, touched by the marble mouth GLORIA GRAHAM, wants to get two cents in this monumental task as well. So it's been a long time since Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you sort of wonder if he really got too involved with minute details because of his marriage to worry about JUDY GARLAND's wart. Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted on this false story. What were they thinking?
