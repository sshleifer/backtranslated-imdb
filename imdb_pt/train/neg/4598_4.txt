The wife of a theater producer in London hopes to fix the American man of music and dance starring her husband's last show with a well-known American girl who makes her model fashions in society circles. Unfortunately, the couple have already met on their own, with the girl thinking that the guy is actually the producer of the show married to his friend (the fact that he is not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstanding!) . Wafty musical Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers is finally dragged back to Earth by the idiotic script of Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott, who is full of youthful behavior. Astaire and Rogers not only 'find themselves cute' - they meet ridiculously (he's tapped like crazy in the hotel suite above hers and she complains). The 1935 audience probably did not care how these two would get together - as long as they did, and fortunately. Seen today, the central characters seem to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms: he wraps them with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to remain "bland" in the love department) and she gives it to him. Nothing a little dance could not cure! This glamorous couple is as unreal as the settings of London and Venice, but we watch simply because the protagonists are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for those who do not have ... those who do not mind the stupid plot. The musical moments break the monotony of the planned scene, but they can not transcend the surrounding nonsense. ** in ****
