I was able to see a preview of this movie and hope they have time to edit it anyway they can to improve before it is released on August 3rd. Starring Andy Samberg of Saturday Night Live as 'Hot' Rod Kimble. He plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stuntman like his late father. When we find him, he is jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and he almost succeeds. That would be worth a Jackass movie if he was not honestly trying to do that. Isla Fisher plays the older and much more mature girl, Denise. She seems to like Rod enough to join her "team". Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays his half brother, Kevin, who documents acrobatics with a camcorder. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mother, Marie. She remarried with Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a very tough guy who likes to beat Rod in some fights. Of course Rod will not earn Frank's respect until he can beat him. We found out that Frank needs $ 50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so that he can hit his ass, once he is healed, and prove himself a man. A long fall on the mountain side convinces Rod to "go big" on a feat. Rod begins to receive seed money charging for stunts that would leave him scared if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch, at a children's birthday party. There were those on display who managed to laugh at most acrobatics. Just when all hope and money is lost, along comes a sponsor who saves the day by taking the 15 school buses Rod wants to skip. It receives exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines for donations. Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle. The whole city ends and the world tunes. Does he make the leap? Did he get the girl? Do they raise the $ 50k? Did Frank hit Rod's butt? Wait until this 90-minute movie comes out on video to find out.
