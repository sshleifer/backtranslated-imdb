What made me trace this movie was the vampires' vision, I thought I had to get the other movies that this guy (Larroz) did, I'm sorry I tracked it down, it's a weak attempt of a hidden / satanic type movie loaded with sex and only sex (with actors and ugly actresses, this is an excuse for the sleaze.) The only redeeming factor was the scenery and the atmosphere, avoid this, much hype surrounds it, not worth the effort to find it, refers to the welcome to the edition of the grinding house I hope he has some other films that lives up to Vampires, Oh and the goat scene was very annoying, I understand that this is what carries the hype.
