Tarzan's latest film, starring Johnny Weissmuller (looking surprisingly old a year after "Tarzan and the Huntress"), is bad, despite all the triviality you can add to make it look better. It is obvious that the RKO tried to give Weissmuller a great farewell, filming beautiful landscapes in Mexico, with a great star of the country (Andrea Palma) and several award winners, the filmmaker Gabriel Figueroa, and bringing the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to score. Although it may have cost less to film overseas, it seems more expensive than any other RKO movie in the series, taking advantage of the beaches of Acapulco and the actual pyramids like Aquatania, and with stunning decorations for all scenes related to the Temple of God Balu the exterior, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann should have stayed as a director instead of Robert Florey, who gives a very slow pace. Neumann did a good job with "Tarzan and the Amazons," "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman," and "Tarzan and the Huntress," and finished his career directing the classic "The Fly" the year before his death; while Florey became television director after a career of few notable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimp playing Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, a nasty postman who sings horrid songs (which have a Caribbean air, in a location supposedly for Africa and filmed in Mexico! Drowsy and decidedly tacky, it was a sad goodbye to Tarzan of Weissmuller.
