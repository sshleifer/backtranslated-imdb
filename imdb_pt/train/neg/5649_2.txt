I do not think this is too bad of a show in the right conditions. I tolerated the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a program about lawyers who are not really lawyers. God forbids anyone to go to law school based on these programs, which I've heard was the case when I attended some program interviews. It just made me choke a little. <br /> <br /> That aside, Spader and Shatner, who should be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. While this may be a compliment in some situations, it certainly is not here. They constantly harass the women in the show is funny in the beginning. But since that's what they're doing literally all the time, I realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get. Trying to interweave some serious, dramatic, and even abrupt moments amid this mockery of a real show, it can not make up for the progressive loss of interest I have experienced trying to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore's extravagant and free "public service announcements", in which he expels his opinions, do not impress. Denny Crane is annoying. I was embarrassed by him and by the writers of the show because of Crane's speech in a colonial outfit. <br /> <br /> I am giving two stars because there are times when I thought the program's attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were made carefully. <br /> <br /> I think the writers of the program became aware that the sexual harassment exhibited by Denny and Alan was being domineering even for those who invited them more from the beginning. The point is, I do not care if the sexual harassment treatment on the program was well done, but I felt the writer was insulting me with artificial sexual implants throughout the show, hoping that my libido would keep me coming back for more. I'm no longer a teenager, and I think this show is promising if your goal is not to meet the lowest common denominator for ratings. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm writing this after I realized that it really will not get much better than this. Too bad, because it's one of those shows I'd love to love.
