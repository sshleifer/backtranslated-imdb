"Gray Matter" AKA "The Brain Machine", but the video guys thought better; the screen says 1972, but IMDb says 1977; It's that kind of movie. The government has some kind of primary interest in this 'brain machine' project that recruited four people - who become approximately a philosopher, an excited priest, a crazy veteran, and a patriot who had an abortion - to sit in a shrinking with a computer that can read your hideous secret thoughts. In the end, the government takes over the lab by force and everyone dies. Here is a movie that is incompetent in all important respects; MY *** has better production values ​​than that. However, what interested me most was to see exactly what these filmmakers thought they were doing, entering the four-person drama in a room. The answer: a pamphlet about how science is inferior to God. Thank you very much. It's like opening an egg Kinder and picking up your 30th puzzle. The priest is played by James "Roscoe P. Coltrane" Best, the philosopher of Gerald "the Republican Simon" McRaney. Also featuring very, very, very long establishment and large transition shots, this moves almost as slow as the Liberal convention.
