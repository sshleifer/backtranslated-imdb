Of course, if you ask any mother who is the most beautiful baby in the world, she would say that her son is the most incredible boy in the world. She's right, at least in her own world. <br /> <br /> The producers of the film were Biggie's mother and her good friend Puffy. Oh, well, do I need to say more? I will share this for those who do not want to make a simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. You can just put some MTV videos together and call it a movie. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. The real thing in life is like a dog. <br /> <br /> I just wonder why he called himself a little biggie. Big body little dick? Big mouth Small sound? Big, small, fat eyes?
