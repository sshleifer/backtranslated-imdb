This movie kind of disappointed me. It looked a lot like the Jaws movie, when Hopper was telling the mayor to close the parks it was like when Roy Shider was telling the mayor to close the beaches. Both said it's not summer! But the box says that Hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one. But it really does not do anything very interesting or exciting. I'm not at all convinced that he and his partner have any experience of doing the police work when they're in the office, wondering how they're going to solve this case. They just say the police work and we'll sort this out. And what about all the old pool tips. I did not even begin to believe they were mafia bosses. And then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob chose to find the killer. With his one hundred dollar haircut and he thinks his Di @ k is the size of a school bus. Come the raw lines. I thought he was going to hit him with a baseball bat like the other movies. I used this movie and did not buy it again. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh, and it was funny to see the microphone above the scene where the funnel is going out for coffee.
