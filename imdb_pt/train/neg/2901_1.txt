The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in real life about IMDb just makes me realize that his junkets team is working hard to get people to watch this extremely awful movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words, I have no idea where to begin to describe the really horrible movie I spent last night - Dan in real life. Steve's characters in the previous films made me believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialogue, but like other posters, I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed by the cast. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so invented that the family was the family of the Walton cookie cutter and the movie has been so many times before I was shocked that someone thought it was an original idea. Do yourself a favor and take a step in this terribly bad movie and do not Believe everything you read in IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in a different theater watching a good movie.
