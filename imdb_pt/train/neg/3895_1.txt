It was once some evil people made a movie about a guy who was shot in space, supposed to go to Saturn, but really only for some pictures of solar blasts, and then he gets a bleeding nose, and before you know it, He is lying in a bandaged hospital on foot, and then an overweight nurse in an ill-fitting uniform arrives and is devoured by the guy, who should be melting everywhere, but never seems to lose any mass, and then NASA, or at least one guy at NASA, gets upset about it and calls another guy to hunt it, but the guy they sent to hunt the guy melted has to go home and have a soup first, and his strange wife in forgotten form the crackers, so he can not have crackers, and then he has to go out and look for the guy melting with a geiger counter, and this does not really work, so he actually follows only the trail of corpses eaten by the etade, and then there's something about a sheriff, and two ugly people in a lemon grove, and a woman with a cleaver, a kind of industrial plant with security guards, and how can I not tell you how the movie ends, everything what I can say is that Jonathan Demme is somewhere with a guy with the stupid name of Burr DeBenning, and if there is any justice in the world where everyone connected with this movie has died in a hideous and violent way and has failed to do more movies, and the world lived HAPPY AFTER THE END!
