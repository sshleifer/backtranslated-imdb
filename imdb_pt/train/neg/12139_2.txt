I remember when this happened, a lot of kids went crazy about it. I think I was a bit too old to get all excited and I was a fan of true martial arts movies and I always found it a bit extravagant. <br /> <br /> In the early 1990's we were overwhelmed with programs like this. making the kids feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these kids in 3 ninjas. I think parents and filmmakers grew tired because all we had was really a bunch of kids beating and beating everyone. <br /> <br /> Many children's films have a great point that they are trying to do. and it's good for your kids to watch and get the message, this one has no message ... just explore a million different things in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film has No great visual qualities, but would be expected? The acting is very bad. Victor Wong is a great actor, but it was embarrassing to see him here. The fart was short, fat and fat as a powerful ninja who was hilarious. The kids acted too much and the newest Tum Tum ninja was perhaps the worst actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie has a storyline that anyone knows before even reading the review. 3 ninjas ... yes, you know they're going to fight a bunch of bad guys and win, obviously ... I need to say more. Sorry if I screwed up to anyone. <br /> <br /> With all that said, kids will love it. This movie is meant for kids and only kids could have fun. If you do not mind your kid watching movies about struggling kids, this is a good movie for them to watch. If you do not mind allowing your kids to see the complete trash that has nothing to do with actual martial arts, real acting or reality period then you've found a movie for your kids ... I say kids because I think up the girls I remember all the girls having a crush on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for kids and still make it nice for adults ... this movie failed great time .. It's beyond cheesy and nothing original or original and I would not allow a son of mine to watch it ... Kung Fu the TV series is on DVD and there are tons of great Shaw Brothers movies out there. ..Why not show your children things that really entertain them and do not fool them along the way, maybe even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as Grandpa did in 3 Ninjas .. no no no ... never kick a man between the legs ... never .. this is so unninja like.
