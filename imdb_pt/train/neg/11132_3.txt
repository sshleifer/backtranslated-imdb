A documentary filmmaker, like any filmmaker, should convey a compelling story. Will Pascoe will totally fail in this effort, bringing together uninspired bits of Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage is filmed amateur and video. Pascoe's only effort to coerce the fragments into a whole is periodically to cast a vague on-screen title: "9-11," "Activism," "Truth." <br /> Lame. <br /> <Compare this to documentaries like "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War," which create a narrative drawing material for interviews, stock footage and filmed footage. In the end, each one delivers a moving and insightful message cleverly and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only saving graces of the film are Chomsky's carefree and unfolding unfoldings of historical dogma and the fact that the duration is only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting passages was Chomsky's account of his experience with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more flexible to divergent views, while the liberal dogma of NPR beats up with its respondents and dramatically limits their allowed messages. Yet another means of communication to be skeptical. <br /> <br /> This documentary is only for the finalists of Noam Chomsky.
