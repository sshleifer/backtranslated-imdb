Whenever a story of Columbus strays from the family plot (colored murderer commits a crime, Columbo smokes a murderer, Columbo becomes a plague in the process), writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most of the traditional episodes . This episode goes to extremes, and the result is a great failure. <br /> <br /> Would you believe: Columbus never faces the villain to the end? !! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was tempted to turn it off by about two-thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices we, self-appointed reviewers do!
