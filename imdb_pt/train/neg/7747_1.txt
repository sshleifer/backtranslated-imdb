Just the fact that the cover is a drawing, like those old B movies, should give a warning about the quality of this film. This is, however, not a B movie. It's a D! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors, and animals - WOW - is the worst data animation ever made during the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You almost never see the SCAAARY saber shown on the cover. You just hear people scream, bleed and die and you occasionally see a tiger's paw or tooth. He's so amateurish! Maybee is worth seeing, just because it is so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen, and wait for their reaction." He, he. <br /> <br /> The movie is weak to give a Spoiler Alert! THIS IS A SPOILER.
