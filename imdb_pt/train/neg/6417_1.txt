As comments like the one that was the headline of high school girls until they appear on this site, this was the stupidest movie I've ever seen, it was ridiculous, how could any moron sit there and say it just because a movie makes you jump is a good movie, which may be the dumbest thing I've ever heard, I could sneak in behind you and go "Boo" and this would make you jump, but that does not mean I'm qualified to write or direct a movie, not to mention "they tied it all together in the end" is not a good reason for a film to be well received. What kind of movie would it be if they did not tie it all together, I think it would make half a movie, not a whole movie. So basically, this idiot girl is praising them for finishing the movie, well, I love how the young people of today keep media and production companies to such a high standard. No wonder the political system in this country can get away with whatever they want, we have idiots like that popping up in our country, what would happen if that girl really ended up taking anything someday, that's a scary thought. Win a life and watch a real movie someday, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront, or something, and do not say it was "boring" after seeing it, use the little brain God gave you to analyze one little.
