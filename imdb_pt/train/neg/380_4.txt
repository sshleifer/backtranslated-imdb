I wonder if there's any sense in this movie. It's a big joke. Good .. It's fun .. You get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a movie .. I wonder what audience group this movie is basically targeted. <br /> <br /> Priety (a pros) plays a surrogate mother to a happy Salman / Rani couple who wants a child but can not. I wonder what it would be like if this drama were a real take-off in the life of a real couple. Rani seems happy with another beautiful lady in her house who was brought in to make a child. for her and Salman. She takes care of Priety and tries to push her husband Salman to Preity so they can have some romance. When will the public get tired of Salman's nakhras? <br /> <br /> Although it is a good time for the past, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
