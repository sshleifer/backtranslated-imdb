Well, the reason to see him in the movies was that it was a preview, otherwise I would have never seen this terrible movie of terror. I mean, have not we had enough of that yet? Scream and Scary Movie, at least, did not take them seriously! The plot is a drug, and the acting is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst I've ever seen in the movies with this one.) <br /> <br /> There are so many holes in the story, and the girls are so alike, that neither have you killed and killed. And you do not care. The only one I knew beforehand was Denise, and she was the most talented less actress I've ever seen in that bad excuse for a movie. <br /> Stay as far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)
