Carlo Verdone once managed to combine an excellent comedy with clever and subtle social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> So something happened, and it turned into just another boring, holy-what-you-director. Il Mio Miglior Nemico can more or less be summed up in a line "working class = gentle and warm, while upper class = snobbish and dishonest. But love wins in the end". a trite clich√© for such an intelligent director. <br /> <br /> There is not much to talk about in the movie. Each character is a walking stereotype: the self-made man who forgets his roots, but who will become "good" again, the despised wife, the rich rebel girl who falls in love with the honest but poor guy ... Acting is average evil . <br /> <br /> Severely disappointing in every way.
