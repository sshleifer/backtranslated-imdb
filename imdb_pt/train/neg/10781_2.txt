In fact, it never was. I do not know why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a crazy comedy from the 1940s. What an empty mess! None of these people comes close to a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., and anyway, the audience today is not so receptive to this easy mess. Writing is trivial. The banal plot is thin and obvious. The chemistry between the main characters is non-existent. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she is a reincarnation of a big star of the "golden age of Hollywood", whenever it is. It's an effect she tries and can not do once again with Richard Gere in Fleeing Bride.
