Becky Harris plays the female client whose unhappiness is being in the store at the wrong time and obviously the sole purpose of being in this movie is to provide a reason to wear down the remotes! Miss Harris seems to be in her fifties or more when she first steps into the picture. Once the red-haired thug is done with it, it becomes apparent that this is not an AARP queen. If these are not some of the best features already displayed on the celluloid, I want someone to tell me. Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and I literally took my copy on VHS capturing its charms. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie does not deserve to be mentioned. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and clever, however, I was disappointed in both counts. God bless Becky Harris!
