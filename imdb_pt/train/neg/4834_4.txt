I was looking forward to the Kathryn Bigelow movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars that was awarded. Unfortunately, it really is not a good movie. The description of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable in all respects, but in addition the story simply seemed incomplete and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and random. The actors made a good effort, but for me I really did not understand what the film was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and exciting as the Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, not as action-packed as ... well, anything. I certainly can not understand why he was nominated for either, or why people are "exalting" these epic proportions. Remember, given the caliber of the films in the last two years, I suppose there is not much to choose from.
