This is a moderately interesting gore fest from the 80's with some nasty slugs with human blood taste. If you can get through the ridiculous of the whole thing, you can get some extra pleasure out of it. The acting is horrible and the plot is simply there to keep the film together between sneak attacks, but the film is not a complete waste of time. The special effects are really good, and the blood is well done. This reminded me of Blob's remake, probably because of the scarcity of everything. All in all, you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I would not suggest watching this movie unless you have a strong stomach and be in that sort of thing.
