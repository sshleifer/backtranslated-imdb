Soon after watching this movie, you'll realize why it has not even hit theaters! This movie does not deserve the "prequel" tag. Instead, this is a common theme in Hollywood, ripping out good movies with pre-sequences, sequels, etc. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie was jumping all over the place like a ping pong ball, and the character's development was non-existent. I really felt like I was watching a comedy at some points in the movie because the acting was so bad. P Diddy needs to stop corrupting movies with his horrible acting, he really made me laugh all the time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks great in this movie and actually brought some pleasure watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Carlito's Way, I recommend that you do not watch it. If you decide to watch it anyway, treat this movie as if it had ripped off the original, because that's exactly what it did.
