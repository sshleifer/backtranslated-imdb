There is a fundamental aspect of the film that Jobson seems to have forgotten - he has the ability to tell a story showing to you. You do not have to tell the public what to think, because they will see. The action here is interspersed with some of the heavier narratives unleashed upon the unsuspecting public - the purple prose of the sensitive fifth ex. And this should be unnecessary, because yours is a beautiful cast here and some beautifully composed and filmed visuals. Maybe Jobbo thought the basic story needed a bit of support. And he may be right, he lacks a basic credibility: Edinburgh in the 1970s was not exactly full of pretty smart girls with a crush on the Velvet Underground and a crush on a deceased sociopath. From the very beautiful and new clothes that the character uses to the intellectualism of the cod that tries to connect all this, everything is very artificial for my taste.
