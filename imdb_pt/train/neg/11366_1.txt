The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was during a Sneak preview. Had not been to the premiere. I remember there was someone on the management team there, I do not even remember who. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and is miles away everywhere else. He plays an actor whose star stopped long ago. He is helping to stage a film in Belgium titled "Shadows". <br /> <br /> As soon as the film started, we realized how much there is swearing. Nothing against the occasional swear words. However, this was way beyond annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the word F *** to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone from the cast, a non-English speaker uses the word F **** or S ***, he becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost count of how often we used the words F and S. Everyone was happy to be out of the theater. And we had to cast a vote, but it was difficult for us because it was only 0 to 10, and we were looking for the -10.
