Before I started watching the show, I heard that it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a mistake, the scripts are so stupid that I'm sure the authors are the son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And about SFX and colors, they're so extreme that it's painful to watch, the colors are not saturated, they're super saturated, scripts are overwritten and the show is overrated. This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are sufficient. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally empty and total lack of credibility.
