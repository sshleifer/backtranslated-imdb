I thought Harvey Keitel, a young, fresh from Sex Pistols John Lydon, then as a bonus, the music of Ennio Morricone. I was expecting an old-school, nervous Italian police thriller that was made in America. Istead, I have a story of mitzmash that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: WTF !!! Many unanswered questions and insufficient actions. The result: a potential classical cult was thrown into the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can bring those guys together with a better script. Oh, and the Morricone score: Ok, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a waste of time, but not a "must see," unless you're an unconditional Keitel fan.
