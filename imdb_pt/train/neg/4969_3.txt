First, this is not as bad as the junk that the Sci-Fi Channel produced; That's not to say that Grendel is a good movie, actually, it's really bad, but it definitely had potential to be much better. The flaws of the film come from the design of characters, characters, absurd additions to history, visual effects, music and most of the time: acting. <br /> <br /> When I talk about character design, I, of course, means the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem to be ridiculous Vikings instead of brute force warriors - the helmet our main protagonist uses is too much nonsense. Grendel looks like the Hulk, but with strange accessories of tentacles on the elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from beginning to end, however Finn - a useless helper - has achieved some two-dimensionality, thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth also has some notion, since he becomes less convinced. <br /> <br /> Just like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it your own, while still retaining the original material. The beast that is gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous, I'm surprised the cast has not left the set. In addition to additions, there are omissions such as the underlying themes of Christianity and paganism as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> Special effects are tremendously terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are ill-conceived and as such, they are portraits on the screen is less than believable. <br /> <br /> Music is arrogant, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not the worst science fiction movie to date. No. It's actually one of the best movies, although it's still rubbish, it's good rubbish, making it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is dialogue, which is still wood here and there. <br /> <br /> I recommend you skip this movie and watch Robert Zemeckis on the old Beowulf story, simply because this movie (Grendel) is only half the tale, not the whole thing, which guarantees this movie a three star review.
