Student Seduction finds Elizabeth Berkley from Saved By The Bell Alumni across the table attracting the attention of young, handsome Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself, I can honestly say that no teacher but one has ever done anything to me back when I was a student. This was a Mrs. Diaz who was a music teacher in high school. Even though I was a gay girl, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who could somehow have been played by Elizabeth Berkley. Corey, being the smartest he is, is also accustomed to having his own way with women, agreeing or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces this belief. He is failing chemistry, which is what Berkley teaches and to maintain his GPA, she agrees to teach but does not believe anymore. <br /> <br /> So when he tries a rape and does not get an answer, it's harmful to his ego. When Berkley steps out of the canals and reports the crime to the police, police officers who are recalling the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau simply do not believe it. Sevier's parents have the means to get good publicity about it for the boy. <br /> <br /> The Student Seduction, which is an improper name for a title, if there is one is rubbish all the way. After the beating that Berkley took to Showgirls, this TV movie was not a career-raising move.
