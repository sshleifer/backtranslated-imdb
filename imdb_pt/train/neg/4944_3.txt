So why is this show bad? Unfortunately, this is really the only question, because there is no doubt that this happens. <br /> <br /> For those unfamiliar with the premise of the show, the doomed series to be short-lived, Cavemen, focuses on a number. of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern America and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for Geico Insurance. The concept is solid and there is every reason to think that it could run successfully. <br /> <br /> I had to think about this for a while, but then the slogan of the commercials - something to the effect of "We're not much different from you" provided me the key to the suckiness of the show. Although cave men / Neanderthals are actually a different kind of humanity, the title characters of this program are, in fact, exactly like those of us who are boring idiots. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's my background as a game writer - rather than a non-moral, hacked, committee-based California writer-but this program had a lot of potential, and none of that was accomplished. To begin with, producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cave men different from us. <br /> <br /> What could be funny, for example, giving them occupations as a perpetual graduate student and furniture clerk. , when would they have been more attracted to things like underground workers and guides in cave parks? Why would they play prosaic games like squash, when an entire episode could be dedicated to them trying to get hunting licenses to go after the game with spears? A program like this could be written, and it takes an intentionally bad writing to make it so bad and annoying. Another grueling aspect of this program is an attempt to portray cavemen as subject to the number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. To yawn! This has been done so many times before, and never more melancholy than that. And, as noted earlier, Neanderthals really are a different species, so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotypes is both unpacked and off target. <br /> <br /> Answers are welcome, including those from those who want to tell you why I am wrong. I would like to take this show and regret only for being unable to do so. <br /> <br /> Michael J. Varhola, Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine
