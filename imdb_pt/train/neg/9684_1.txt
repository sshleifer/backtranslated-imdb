Stilted, stagy, strange and opaque, if visually stunning ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy. Really annoying, too much male nudity (including incest between father and son), and just kind of shameless shamelessness. I confess, however, that certain passages of dialogue, taken on their own terms, have a disturbing and frightening quality.
