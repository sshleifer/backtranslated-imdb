Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest Hollywood star because he made great movies? These days are feeling like an ever-distant memory. <br /> <br /> Although "Hollywood Homicide" is by no means terrible, it is a routine film and surprisingly police friend. It's a comedy that is not particularly funny and an action movie that is not especially exciting. An overabundance of subframes can not mask the weakest of the central plot. <br /> <br /> At least Ford seems to be having more fun than his latest projects, and he is able to take the film most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford when it comes to chemistry. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Hollywood Homicide" is reasonably fun fun, but just barely. Take out Ford, and that's not it.
