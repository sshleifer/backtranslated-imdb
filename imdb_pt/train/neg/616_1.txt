Let's face it; some lame kid who dies and has his soul transferred to a scarecrow. Das will not happen snow! OMFG This stupid loser boy who can not defend himself gets his butt delivered to him by some drunken bastard fucking his mother. As soon as he dies, he looks at the scarecrow and lets his spirit into the scarecrow. The drunk covered his death making him appear suicidal and thought he had escaped with it. Later we see that he is thrown out of the trailer and then wins another encounter with the scarecrow. They had a brief encounter that includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow recovering with "Takes one to know one, loser!" The scarecrow leaves the building, calls him "Daddy" and then behead the poor man. We can see how this incredible movie unfolds from it. He continues to kill many people later. He mostly kills people who gave him a hard time in rl and leaves to kill some random people, just for a few laughs. I did not laugh here. He adds a joke to every death as well. Every time he killed someone, he did some karate maneuvers and ended up with one of his signatures. In the case of someone who was hard of hearing, he would say, "Here, eat a corn!" then thread in the tail. OR we can actually get an example from the movie! He just killed a police officer and was on his way to kill the only person who ever stood up for him. His father, the sheriff, shouted for the madman to stop, and he said, "Hey, stay a little!" and threw a dagger threw his breast and stuffed it into some tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two guys and played the joke "I have to split!" and killed two guys pushing a sickle into their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want to skim it so much. Maybe next time this guy makes a movie, do not be gay.
