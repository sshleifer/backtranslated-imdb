This is a rather old-fashioned movie that aims to show the yearning for youth for freedom in some inhumane British school. Ah yes, it's like in the army, you learn to obey and you do what you ask. Yes, the young dream of something else, but it breaks their dreams and sweeps their optimism on the threshold of life. Great. <br /> <br /> Basically this is how you could sum up the good intentions in If ... Good intentions that do not provoke cinematic challenges: the result is a declamatory movie. Do you see how boring I mean? At least that old man helped Kubrick found McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a film with a truly powerful social satire and no self-indulgent sentimentality.
