I was drawn to the title ... I was hoping for an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism; instead, I have a rather boring and uninspiring story about a loud Scot. <br /> <br /> The main character is not given much psychological depth unless you are willing to classify teenage poetry as psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a pity because the core of the story could have been good, with a better effort to describe the inner feelings. of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence from his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be more like "I am the way I am because that's how I am." And the harsh attempt to give a kind of poetic advantage to a low-class man makes things even worse. To resort to the exaggerated cliché of "poète maudit" is a quick way to make a boring movie sound intelligent, artistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not very smart, artistic or significant ... The main character does not evolve, and the weak attempt to change fails without a good explanation. Just like the initial attempt happened unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of classics like A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but ends up failing to regain its greatness, not even for a few seconds. Jobson put a lot of emphasis on the artistic side of the story, and neglected the rest by giving us a movie that is pleasing to the eye but tasteless to the brain.
