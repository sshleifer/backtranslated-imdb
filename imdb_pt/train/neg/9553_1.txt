No wonder this was released directly to the DVD here in Australia, with no redeeming features. The dialogue was fake, the acting horrible and the script sucked !! Whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a follow up or follow John Badham's Wargames movie of the '80s, they must be on something because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at it as an eye candy / love interest while Matt Lanter was good as the other main track - that's about it. I would not recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone, check out Hackers or the original Wargames movie - both are better than this piece of crap !!
