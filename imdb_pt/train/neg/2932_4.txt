Not that he cared, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I were, there would be a good chance we would have a fall if he continued to make slag like that. The problem is that he found a successful formula as the common face-to-face type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, etc., but it's starting to wear out. Here his character has no discernible qualities, he is rude and unpleasant, and thinks he is funny when he is not. When transferred from London to New York (and I assume that this link serves to attract viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he is equally out of place with his new colleagues. Still, it is no wonder that among his jovial Japanese he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting for an act of revenge by his boss. However, somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to heat up for him, even if he has not done anything good. Oh, and because he's a shallow man, he falls for Megan Fox at first glance, possibly because his character is as shallow as his. It all leads to a predictable conclusion in the cinema, although I can not see any spectators expressing how this reflected their lives. The shame is that on paper this is a cast that is supposed to be worth watching. Pegg, however, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go away, not creating any chemistry on the screen, and Megan Fox is not stretched. The only advantage is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's owner in New York - now, if she had been on the screen any longer ...
