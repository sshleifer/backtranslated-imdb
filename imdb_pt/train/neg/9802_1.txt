Many people say that this program is only for kids. Hm, when I was a kid (about 7 to 9 years old), I watched this show first. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other kids about it and of course other shows and you know what? That was the extent of the disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize the nonsense of something (on TV or anything else), we said "Uh, just like the Power Rangers" and we laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there really are fans of MMPR. It was so strange to me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not like that view. But it occurred to me: maybe I do not have enough imagination? Can be. However, this argument is not enough for me to evaluate more than one star.
