The movie is a bit boring. It is mostly a silent film, with most of the story provided through a series of narrations. While making a silent movie like this is not such a bad idea, it's one of those movies where lack of dialogue and repetitive start-up scenes make it simply tedious. You do not understand the reason for boredom until you get to the picture and it's too late. The first 40 minutes of film are a slow piece of soft Mexican porn and mild bland porn. Later in the movie, the style of the first 40 minutes begins to make sense, but it's too late, because by then the audience is lost. There is a good location filming at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I often wonder why more movies are not filmed there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields that give the campus a very supernatural feel. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer made the film the way he wanted to see it without considering how a viewer who does not know the story will see it. You can not ignore the audience when you tell a story.
