John Goodman's show was pretty awful, but it just stinks. The only thing in this mess that made me smile was to recognize Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by someone who misrepresented the memories of childish rebellion, but never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia rules the shadowy world these characters inhabit. Everyone is unpleasant and unreasonable. The plot is predictable, but the show goes from one unexplained and disconnected scene to another in a way so meaningless that it's not fun to watch it. The worst is that no one on the production team seems to have seen snow!
