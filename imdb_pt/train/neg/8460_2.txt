I just rented this movie because of the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that seeing the RR name on the cover (as an actor), that movie would be good. Sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would do if he were to lend his name to it, so it has to be good, right? WRONG WRONG WRONG. By far the worst edition since "Hands Hands of Fate". The way it was edited made no sense and made the film impossible to keep up with, and after the first 30 minutes you would not even try to follow it. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this movie, maybe they should somebody, but they are good at it. Also, they were only in this movie for a few minutes each and Rodriguez did not even talk. So if you want to see a movie with Poor's editing, bad acting and confusing plot than being my guest, but do not say you were not warned.
