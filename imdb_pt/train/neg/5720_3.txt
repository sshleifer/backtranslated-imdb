Some friends of Gorehound have recommended "Live Feed" to me, and basically I can not complain, since the film certainly produces large amounts of gross rubbish and buckets full of sleaze, but of course it's not a very good movie. More than obviously profiting from the latest trend in horror movies, the so-called Torture Porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to outdo all the other films in this sub-genre (and this includes the "Hostel" and "Saw" models) with their patients. And distorted makeup effects and completely depraved photos of naked co-eds have experienced, suffered, and beg for their lives. There is no real plot to describe. Five friends in their twenties go on a trip to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but other than that I do not really know why they chose to travel there instead of to Cancun. They are clearly not interested in the culture of the continents and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local chick slaughtering a fluffy dog ​​in the market. The quintet then plunges into the shocking nightlife and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. A simple apology is clearly not enough, as the gangster follows them to an adult theater and gradually subjects them to cruel tortures. One girl has her chest impaled and another poor girl has even a venomous snake in her throat; yikes. "Live Feed" is surprisingly tedious, despite all the bloodshed and amateur production figures are very difficult to ignore even if you are accustomed to watching independent junk movies like this. The fat guy shown on the cover, an Eastern executioner from S & M, is admittedly very cool and is also the most talented of the whole group because he at least keeps his mouth shut all the time. I would not recommend exactly that pile of dirt, but hey, if you like noisy and horrendous metal music, filming nauseating torture and stupid losers, go ahead and watch!
