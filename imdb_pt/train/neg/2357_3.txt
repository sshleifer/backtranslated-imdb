Let's hope this is the final nightmare. This is the epitome of a good thing that went awry. Okay, there is still some pleasure to be had, but only in the most mundane sense. Rachel Talalay was present throughout the franchise, was on the production team and even produced. I do not know what she was thinking, but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had an idea of ​​what she was thinking when she wrote / directed this disappointing piece of junk. She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than a super-glorified popcorn movie, rather than having any semblance of horror with the artificial use of a 3D ending. Are these glasses not cool? And you can keep them! It's the equivalent of, you spent $ 9.00 making me rich. Here are 10 cents. Now, do not you feel special? Sorry, but for me, that did not make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy's had another facelift. This was for the worst, I think. All the fine art that came into your "look" in the previous films was replaced by an obviously less expensive and less detailed set of prostheses. He looks ... less like the burn victim than he should be, and more like he has a skin disorder. Changing lead composition so far in a series is on the same level as changing the lead actor. But wait! They did it and did it. So I guess it does not matter. But it mattered to me. Freddy is no longer scary. He's just ... another low-income monster like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a somber comedy than the classic terror promised by the series; riddled with what you can only hope the writers think were witty and an intelligent replica (unfortunately, fell short on both accounts). <br /> <br /> So there's nothing more to say than picking up the popcorn and getting ready to laugh because there has not been a scary or suspenseful moment throughout this movie. <br /> <br /> He ranks a 3.2 / 10 from ... <br /> the Demon :.
