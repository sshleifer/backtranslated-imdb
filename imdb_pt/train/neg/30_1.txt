I did not like the idea of ​​the female tortoise since 1987, we knew that the TMNT was four brothers with his teacher Splinter and his enemies and each of the four brothers was named after great artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphel and Donatello then Venus here has no meaning or plays no significant role and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one containing Venus. As a female turtle will not add any action to the story that we like the story of the TMNT we met in 1987 to having new enemies in each part is a good point to take some action, but to have a female tortoise is a weak spot to have some action, we want to see more news of the TMNT series, but just like the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female tortoise.
