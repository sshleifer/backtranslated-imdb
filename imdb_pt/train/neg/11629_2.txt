** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic, does not have a plot, and was basically made just to see the stars recant. The most suspenseful scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and then we see her TV playing the PSYCHO shower scene. This movie really expected users to believe that Naseeruddin Shah's character has a memory good enough to remember where certain shots were fired and how many! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER BEGINS *** <br /> <br /> In the end, the killer spills his courage to Shabana Azmi long enough to allow the character of Naseeruddin Shah to run up and down. shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** It's a little funny (just a little) at first hear the director and the cast members throwing insults at each other and listening to Shabana Azmi exclaim, "Oh sh- t! <br /> <br /> Overall, a movie baaaaaaaaaaad! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of ********** (2 of 10)
