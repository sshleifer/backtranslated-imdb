This movie is terrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies of all time. I can not even imagine Gigli being worse than that. Previews made us say "NO", but then looking for something in the middle of dreck out there now, we decided to go ahead and give it a shot. <br /> <br /> STUPID USA. <br /> <br /> Affleck is not an actor. He is an image and can be fine with explosions, but not even the type that Bruce Willis has in "Die Hard". If he took off his shirt and ran around fighting villains, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini fails again (if it was not for The Sopranos, he would be washed), as he did in "The Mexican." <br /> <br /> Affleck plays in all the scenes and as others have said - no character has any motivation for his actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.
