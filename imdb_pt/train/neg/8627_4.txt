Although this is usually a fancy adventure jungle movie, it has some highlights - the settings are very beautiful, and the pace of the adventure is good. You will not be bored watching. Keith is as boastful as possible, playing the homonym leader, a shamelessly drunken Shanghai jungle guide to escort the rich boy Van Hoffman and his beautiful wife Shower on a hunt. expedition in the cannibal country. He never takes things seriously. Shower is there as decoration and Keith makes extensive use of it - it really does not have to act much. She is not the only woman to show off her body, and the lewd looks of the movie come half way through a T / A photo. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that draws specific attention to it, or far of this. Produced to be a blockade, it manages without much noise. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
