urgh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good plot and a good cast. I watched this movie hoping it was hilariously terrible and sadly disappointed when it was just terrible. I've lost the will to live in the middle of the road. The only thing that kept me from stabbing my eyes with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was the reason for me to watch it in the first place). She did a good job as Rastus and her appearance has not changed much since she was 13 years old. It was a fantastic first effort in a movie. the dog was also very good. both did a great job with such horrible stuff. Sandra Bernhard I think it was the biggest mistake of the film. she was completely wrong and I think she never understood the character. <br /> <br /> I give the film 2 out of 10 - and that's only because of Rose.
