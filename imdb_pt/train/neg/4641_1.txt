I sometimes enjoy really bad movies ... those that occasionally result when people (even talented people) come together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster. Films like "Attack of the Assassin Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from Outer Space", "Hands-of-Fate" and "Heavens Gate", etc. So when I heard that this movie, "Rachel's Attic," was considered by many to be the worst movie of the decade, of course I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I regret that decision. This movie is beyond evil ... it's so bad it's not as enjoyable as the usual bad movie. The acting, filming, screenplay, etc. are even worse than a low budget porn movie: the sound is totally horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "acting" is laughable ... it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money. At least the porn movie has porn to break the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple, and a "mad hatter" tea party. <br /> <br /> The lighting is non-existent. Many "scenes" happen in complete or semi darkness, which is probably the same. The writer-director (I use the terms loosely), David Tybor, tries to be perverted with scenes of slavery ... but the results would be laughable if they were not so pathetic. There is some nudity, but it is of such an abysmal quality that it acts as a sexual suppressor. I could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly horrible waste of film. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, avoid this train disaster. I know that despite (or maybe because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of crap is really as bad as I claim it to be ... but trust me on this ... it's worse even from what I said, and you absolutely positively regret the experience (and expense if you spend your money on a purchase or rent).
