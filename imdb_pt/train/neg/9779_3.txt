Relentless, non-budget "war table" made primarily to show the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer - not a bad idea in itself - but this should be an embarrassment to all who are attached to it. Rare "script", performances that would not pass in a primary school Christmas contest, inept scenes of "action," confusing direction of normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen - who apparently is not sure if he is making a comedy, a treatise philosophical about the futility of war or a mischievous look at T & A (in the early 1960s, anyway), a travelogue of Eve Meyer's magnificent body - and a general air of naivety and incompetence. Worth seeing in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff, but that's pretty much it.
