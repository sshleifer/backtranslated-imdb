I discovered that this movie is rented based on the packaging. the zombie in front of the DVD looks cool and scary. so you come to the movie and are women with raccoon masks. zero special effects ... and even the fight scenes you can watch them lose punches by 2 feet. The funny thing is that Lommel acts on the film briefly and is worse than the rest of the actors in the film. the only thing I can think of is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad movie that people call it a "cult classic" ... however, I can not imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies of all time did. The real horror in this movie is how bad it is. I'm embarrassed, rented and promise never to see another Lommel movie!
