I was dissapointed. the film was somewhat predictable and did not match the hype throughout the box. That said, the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a single premise and the house was pretty scary, but I missed it. I was waiting for that big AHHHHH or BOO! But that never happened. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was plagued by bad footage of bad special effects. Thus, showing a lot of a bad thing and not using the atmosphere and imagination of the viewer to create the horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or the Cube if you're looking for a low-budget, but well-conceived horror film.
