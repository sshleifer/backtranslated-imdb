Using footage sacked from the Planet of the Dinosaurs, this video footage (except for the stolen footage) concerns a bunch of people tossed into space that land on a dinosaur planet that is ... do not expect it, it's really earth. It's a five-minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes. A little better than Chickboxer (another in the Bad Movie Police series) - with a nostalgic movie at home, coupled with good stolen effects, this movie is still an impossible task. Have I been led to reflect on the issue of being so uncreative that we are now stealing old movies not just from the plot but also from incompatible images? Producers with clearly low budgets are getting so desperate that they really will give us something to take our money
