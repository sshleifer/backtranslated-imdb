A family with his father Louis (Dale Midkiff), mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3-year-old Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful home in Maine - apparently unconscious of the semis roaring down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so! The neighbor on the other side of the path (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and shows an animal graveyard where the children bury their pets.It's a sacred soil that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead come back in a bad mood. <br /> <br /> "DEFINITE SPOILERS ** The novel Stephen King was good - it was long, but he developed characters and situations that made you care about what happened. This movie abandons ALL character development and only reproduces blood and violence. Animals are killed on the camera (I know that it is false, but it is still repulsive) hit by a s emi and his coffin opens during the funeral (in a totally sick scene), he is brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mother (I wonder how a child of 3 years was able to hang her) ; a ghostly runner (do not ask) tries to help the family for no reason ... The movie only makes the audience push every horrible death or violence to their face. It just goes out of your way to shock you. ** END SPOILERS ** Action is not helpful. Midkiff is just terrible as the father - he is handsome and gentle but totally blank. Crosby is not much better. The two kids are just annoying. Only Gwynne, alone, saves this image with his good acting without effort. <br /> <br /> This picture shows a total contempt for the public in making great leaps in logic and having incredibly stupid characters (especially Midkiff at the end). This movie was (inexplicably) a huge box-office hit in 1989, which led to an even worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in a movie theater at the time and I was disturbed as the audience continued to applaud the violence and was shocked by what I saw . A repulsive and sick horror film. All the way. <br /> <br /> When you think that everything is over and can not get worse, the Ramones sing a title song !!!!!! ("I do not want to be buried in an animal graveyard"). Truly unbelievable.
