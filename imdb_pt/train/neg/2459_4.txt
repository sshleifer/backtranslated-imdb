Obviously, I did not care about the book Things To Things (Come The Things To Things) as much as most of the viewers. That means there's a good chance you'll enjoy it more than I do. Either way, you may find it helpful to hear the movie described from another point of view. <br /> <br /> Directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director. , this is a cinematic adaptation of HG Wells's own novel of the same name. In my view, this helps to demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily be a great screenwriter. <br /> <br /> The film begins in 1940, in London, as "Everytown". The war is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that it can reach them. That happens. And this becomes a case of decades that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies continue to advance in showing us different scenes related to the war and its consequences. We see two pilots, one dejected, coming to terms with the consequences of their struggle. We find a post-apocalyptic community ruled by a would-be warlord. We met a man from a flourishing futuristic society. We see the path that technology is changing. And finally, we are led to the full realization of this futuristic society around 2036, where leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon. This may seem potentially very exciting, but it just does not work like a movie. Structurally, the film is very episodic, with little to unite dramatically. In the third segment, I completely lost interest in trying to follow the characters. I could barely separate them in the first two segments. There is a constant parade of new faces. We learned nothing about any of them. <br /> <br /> It does not help that individual segments, with some exceptions, tend to be clumsily directed and edited. They are also occasionally manipulative - it can almost start to look like a propaganda movie. But perhaps contradictorily, the segments are also a bit cold and emotionally dry. <br /> <br /> In fact, a very long section is more like an industrial video / promotional video clip. It features shots to build the futuristic city, with lots of great machinery, lots of welding and so on. At one point, a guy who looks like an astronaut waves to the camera through some sort of futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an exaggerated horror score. I can not say Things to Live consist of involving material in terms of drama. <br /> <br /> But the common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is "a film about ideas." That may be true, but there are some problems with that if viewed in this way. One, it still does not work _as a movie_, that is, as a dramatic visual and sound work, and two, there are many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The main idea is that of war and what it does for civilizations. This is a good thing to do a movie about. It is also notably prescient of World War II, since the book Things To Come was scripted and filmed in 1935 (released in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about the war, some of which go against the usual interpretation of the movie. For example, the ending seems to suggest that another war is emerging or will occur at any time. The overall message seems a little pessimistic. Wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that can not be extirpated, although it does not hinder "progress" - indeed, it may stimulate progress, at least indirectly. <br /> <br /> That would certainly be enough for a movie. However, there are many other ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the most poignant scenes of the film. This is a complex dilemma. One pilot shot the other, but now he's coming to help him. But the pilot who was shot down was carrying poisonous gas that is now spreading across the field. They can not breathe the gas without harm. A girl comes along. They only have two gas masks running between them. The pilot who was shot down offers his mask, as he says he is dying anyway. What to do? It's not that this scene itself can be extended to the size of the resource, but the ideas - the bizarre complex of helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a war - are enough to build a movie. <Br /> <br /> Another example. During the scenes that characterize the aspiring warlord in the post-apocalyptic environment, there is an unpleasant contagious disease called "wandering disease" out there. It transforms victims into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to photograph the victims on the spot in an attempt to avoid the disease. This material is treated as if it were a late reflection. It's a great idea and deserved its own movie. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Wells portrays future society as having controversial socialist ideas. That was enough for your own movie too. It's simply impossible to deal with so much in 100 minutes, especially when it's supposed to be the crux of the movie instead of the dramatic pull. <br /> <br /> Still, there are reasons to give things to come at least one viewing. If you are a fan of science fiction, this is a historically important movie. Given the background of Menzies, the production drawings and set design are interesting, even if cinematography seems extremely outdated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his "predictions". I particularly liked the means of propulsion for the moon, which was reminiscent of George Méliès' 1902 A Trip to the Moon (also known as Le Voyage dans la lune). Just do not expect too much of the things to come.
