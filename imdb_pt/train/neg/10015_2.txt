Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical teenager from the 1950s in a turbulent movie. It's not a horror movie or science fiction. The plot concerns a group of teenagers who are about to be kicked out of their hot rod club because they can not afford to pay the rent. Once cast out, they decide to try an old Haunted House. The only salvation for the film is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in the Creature costume) is an unemployed movie monster played by Blaisdell.
