Very bad acting and a very superficial story. Not even a decent B-Movie <br /> <br /> Events that were supposed to be shocking as humans getting aboard an alien ship were boring and very idiotic. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst science fiction I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since I like the genre but sucked so bad. <br /> <br /> Now there are actually very few good movies on the subject of ALIEN, I think because most of them are low budget <br /> <br /> I give 3/10
