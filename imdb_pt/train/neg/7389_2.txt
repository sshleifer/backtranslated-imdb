I buy or at least watch all Seagall movies. He came out with a handful of good movies, then going down to poor stories, bad camera work and a walk-thru persona, he almost lost me. Some movies ago, he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he is forgotten again. This movie is seriously dark (at whatever level you want to name). There's a lot of slash & gash happening here with no discernible purpose, unless it's a warning against the military. <br /> <br /> Seagall may have had a replacement for many of his scenes, as it was too dark to tell and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape from custody and then started wreaking havoc all over the place. Is it okay since we put an armed guard in the detention room with a prisoner? Anyway, this villain was at least colorful and very focused. There is a lot of gore if you like that king of the thing. It seemed to me that the thugs ripped the same cut every time. I'm glad they did not suck the blood of their unhappy victims. I'll call you back to my resume. It's basically a horror movie disguised as an action movie. December 6, 2006
