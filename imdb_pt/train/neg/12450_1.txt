Ten minutes of history stretched for nearly two hours. When nothing significant had happened in the middle of the road, I should have left. But, always hopeful, I stayed. And he left with a sense of guilt that he wasted his time. Acting was OK, but the plot is so transparent and weak. The script is as idiotic as possible, but again, stretching the ten-minute plot does not leave much room for a good dialogue.
