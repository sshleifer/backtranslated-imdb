After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. The film appeared in the guide and it seemed interesting, so I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to interest me, but the lack of ability to play Jamie Foxx and the slow motion in the plot made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit to be given for acting in that film, he should go to David Morse, who at least tries to make the film interesting. After all, do not plan to impress your friends by choosing this as a renter for a movie night.
