First, I agree with a little that escapes Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His practical delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a success in the university campus circus. He comes across as sympathetic, unpretentious, pragmatic. He does not respond to the current political style (disgusting bipartisanship) and is eyeing the far left and the far right, punishing both of them and for good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself is a failure. In fact, I would not even call it a documentary, but only a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Without a Pause" is no different from watching a speaker on a segment recorded at 3am on CSPAN. There are no camera moves, no edits, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no narrative. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, production is strictly amateur. The audio is terrible and inconsistent; sometimes we do not hear Noam speak, other times we can not hear the questions being posited by those present. When Noam is rarely speaking, we can see the public's reactions, except when we are given a quick shot by his wife, who apparently attends each of his speeches and gets angry with pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie and would say that you are probably better checking your speeches recorded on tape or CD to listen in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a good mood today.
