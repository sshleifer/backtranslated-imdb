I watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was nothing else on, would have been more fun to chew on my feet and probably less painful. I ask everyone to see this just to see how horrible the film can be, it was certainly deliberate. I cringed at every futile attempt at humor carried out in a childlike, unassuming, ill-executed way that was unbelievable. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like a Goodfellas, I think I'm exaggerating? Well, give yourself airtime and think again. Terrible, absolutely terrible. If this was not a joke, the director and any other person responsible for this should be removed and immediately shot after being forced to watch this movie again.
