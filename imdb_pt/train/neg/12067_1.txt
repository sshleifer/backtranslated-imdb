You know that a film does not go well when John Carradine narrates (a.k.a. reads the script and plot synopsis) about his character's funeral procession, just 5 minutes after the movie. Narration is the last will and testament of your character. It stipulates that his property is divided between his 4 children and servants. Children should share $ 136 million equally, but if any of them die, that portion will be divided among the remainder. If all the children die, then it is divided among the servants. To be eligible, they must live on the family property for one week. Sounds like the typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There is little subtext about the nature of the Deans. They are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family, but the real problem begins with the drowning of that dog. From the opening voice of John Carradine, you hope that this movie leads to a Machiavellian game of cat and mouse with a different ending. <br /> <br /> This journey is painfully slow and meaningless. We spent minutes watching people sitting, playing billiards, playing darts, misusing the shot "through the aquarium", dramatic conversations between men wearing silk ties, constant fights, lost circus music, bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of the fake German expressionism, the horror aesthetics of 4th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting. This all inevitably leads to the expected end and not gratifying. You will be happy to still be alive, but the pain may be too great to bear alone. Share children, share. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
