THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S FILM !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "bad acid trip" for children under the age of 5. For a month, my 4-year-old son would ask, "Why was that bunny bleeding from his mouth?" Or "Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?" And that was not the worst of all. We stopped it on a 1/2 hour on but the damage had been finished. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he finally forgot the whole miserable thing. Whoever decided that this movie should be marketed to children should be educated on charges. ... (Go ahead, censor me, my conscience is clear).
