Penn spends time developing his characters, and we almost care about them. However, there are some real problems with the story here, we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the timeline is spoiled. Supposedly defined in 1963, the song is in the late 60s / early 70s. References and dialogue are 70s / 80s. The potential for a powerful climax presents itself, and Penn allows it to disappear. But even with all these difficulties worth watching, but not great.
