This was a "fluffy" movie in the beginning, so it got really mellow and featured mediocre music at best. <br /> <br /> There are many King James English spoken not only boring in today's world, but not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine young people today trying to hear this movie? Forget. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and is nice as "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was also in addition to her good looks and gorgeous red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie with a very good ending, and I can not beat it. Maybe it's worth a rental, for historical love or if you're a big fan of Crosby, but overall, it's not much.
