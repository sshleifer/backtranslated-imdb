Why did I waste 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why was this movie made? Why am I even commenting on this movie? <br /> <br /> One critic said that this movie had the patience to watch and that it was not for everyone. I can not figure out who this movie is for. maybe after dropping an acid, SOMEBODY, SOMEWHERE could watch this and make some sense out of it. It is incoherent, it is not experimental, it is simple and simple rubbish. The movie does not follow any plot, only when you think you have something, well ... you do not. <br /> <br /> I think the ending brought some purpose to the movie (no pun intended), the viewer sees what may be happening. I do not think I put a spoiler here, not that it matters. This film is another must to miss in the world of cinema.
