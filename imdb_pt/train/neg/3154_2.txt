Look, there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this movie, it's just annoying. It's a typical rom-com with an ending that you can see before you see the trailer. The main difference is that the classic rom-coms deal with their stories with humor and lack of pretense. This movie has no pretension, but really has no sense of movement, you feel as if you could get up and leave at any time. The film's production also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago. I recommend re-watching a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this superficial imitation. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you're used to seeing Michael look as cute as Vaughn in Alias, you'll be seriously disappointed by the way they made you look like here.
