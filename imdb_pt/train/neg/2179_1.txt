I just loved watching it and amusing myself with the total wickedness of a movie. I saw this movie through the helpful sarcasm of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I got the DVD. If you turn the other side of the DVD, they show the movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, this is grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The acting, the special effects and the plot in general are very extravagant and unrealistic. "Does not she need lungs?" Crow said, noting that her head can still speak as long as she does not have a body, and Tom Servo just stared wistfully, "No, she has a juice in her neck!" The ending is simply classic and no one can play on this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the "cat fight" between the two strippers. That "Meow" after the fight or scene, anything, was classic. So in a way, this was a fun movie. I think for horror fans, you'll probably like it. For a while, watch the MSTK3 version, you're going to have a big laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 The brain that would die: 1/10
