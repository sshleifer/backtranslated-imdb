This film deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic narrative. Unfortunately, it falls on all levels. The film's greatest weakness is reluctance to commit to anything; has elements of field, moralists and epics without ever committing itself to any of them. As for the story itself, Chr√©tien de Troyes is spinning in his grave in this horrible adaptation that turns the adorable, unbearably innocent Percival into a naughty and rude. <br /> <br /> More likely, two types of people will see this, francophiles or arurophiles. Speaking as one of the latter, I find the film unacceptable and an incredibly shabby and disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
