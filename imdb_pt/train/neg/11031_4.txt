It's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this movie. But the problem is that it's not very good. There was nothing really original in the movie and while the storyline was well presented, the main characters were all a bit harsh and you did not bother with any of them. <br /> <br /> Quite unsightly (and sometimes frankly). bad) photo leaves a little to be desired but I guess you can not expect too much from people who are just making a low budget movie for the devil of it. It is unfair to review the film and compare it to other high budget films. But, unfortunately, this is what must be done. By itself, it's not very good. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But it is not without its good points! I liked the plot. It was built very well and tied well in the end. Sometimes in the really dark scenes, he managed to build a scary feeling as well. <br /> <br /> However, the film can not impress. The characters are practically nonexistent and we do not care about any of them. Any one of them can die, but it is possible to identify the final "survivor" from very early on.
