I've seen some really bad movies, and that's right up there. No plot to speak, it's like one of those bad comma episodes in a novel. I just wanted to hit that little girl because, well, let's just say she's really suspicious all through the movie. The monsters running around using some bling was funny. I also saw a bit of "Silent Hill" inside. And I read that this was done by and or faced a Finnish metal band, Lordi. So it's no wonder it has not made much sense. It seems to be a vehicle to promote the band and nothing more. The FX is very good, the look of the movie, the monsters and even the acting are also good. But the story and the narration of it, are simply not there.
