Unfortunately, I do not remember the book anymore, but I remember being fascinated by Edgar Wallace's stories. This film represents a typical German production of low quality. This does not catch my eye - although the story itself is good, it is just misfits. At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplified and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well-known and beloved German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy can not rescue this poor spectacle. However, there is hope ... I have already been told that the films that are following this film are getting better and better. So in conclusion, I must say that this movie does not deserve the cinematic screen, but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.
