I must admit, there are few books with matching movies that I actually read before seeing the film adaptation. One thousand nine hundred and eighty-four by chance is one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was immersive and interesting prophetic. But the movie just sucked. It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I did not hang up after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half of a two-part assignment for a lesson. It was dark and grotesque, but it did nothing to reach the proper atmosphere. The acting was nothing above average, and considering the fact that there was not much to do, this was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston was unable to escape more than one syllable at a time. Boring, disturbing and visually unpleasant, the film totally cannibalized the book. Wait a second ... Is not it British?
