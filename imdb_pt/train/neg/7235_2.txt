Not even Bob Hope, escorted by a number of great actors, can save this ill-written attempt of comedy in time of war, since its patented time has little to work. The plot involves a Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to flee military service at the outset of World War II, followed by his deceptive enlistment in a confused attempt to woo a colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, played by Eddie Bracken, join him and the three are involved in various adventures on training exercises filmed in the mountains of Malibu, California. Paramount invested very well in this effort, employing some of its top experts, but the direction of the normally trustworthy David Butler was flaccid, and this should be attributed to a comic element missing from the scenario. A shift toward the end of the film to create a chance for heroism on Bolton's part is still born with stunt work and camera action in evidence. Strangely, Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of scorn does very well for them. Dorothy Lamour looks adorable and acts very well, and it is always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb, as his father, whose voice is unique on the screen or radio, but there is little they can do to save this film, cursed as it is with a error in scripting.
