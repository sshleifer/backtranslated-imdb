This can be seen in many different ways. This movie sucks, it's good or just weird. The third probably explains this movie better. It has strange themes and only has a strange plot. So who else, besides Christopher Walken, would interpret this, no matter how bad, average or even how good it could be. <br /> <br /> The acting was what you would expect especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I've always liked it, so you know what's going to get out of it, but that's not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the wall. He is always nice to watch, no matter how bad the movie. Wise comedy is a bit funny. That means, of course, that it has its moments (though very few), but it can stand a little above the top here and there, which makes me feel like the movie was desperate for laughter, but of course not in the right direction . <br /> <br /> The direction was also normal. Barry Levinson is a somewhat overrated director and did not really do a good job here. This movie seemed to have a lot more potential and it did not do much to reach it. Just very average and it did not seem like much effort was put into making this movie. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to good comedy. Obviously, that means the writing here has failed. At best, it's below average. Considering it has its moments, it was not too horrible. This is never good to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If it had not been for Christopher Walken and for the stupid and ridiculous ending, I would have given a lower rating. He is always a character in his films. Still, this is just a weird movie with weird characters that really are not going anywhere. Not quite horrible but I really would not recommend it though because it's a very forgettable movie.
