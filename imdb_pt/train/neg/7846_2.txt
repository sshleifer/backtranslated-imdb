You know, I went to see "The Hills have eyes 2" wanting to like. I really liked the original, and the remake was quite entertaining. They obviously had more money to play than Wes Craven did in special effects the second time around. Even though I still prefer the original movie, the remake was done well, and it was kind of guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to "The Hills have eyes 2". Dude, where do I start? The plot, or the lack of one, is fine as paper. We are not exactly breaking new ground here. The military decided to monitor the area, and all these people appear missing. So what do we do now? We're going to have the National Guard investigate. In true Hollywood fashion, we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever seen. Wow, I've never seen this premise before. To shorten the story, you have the mutants killing the idiot soldiers, one at a time, graphically. Again, Nicotero's special effects are great, but deaths, no matter how graphic become boring and predictable. Honestly, it seemed to me that this movie was made just to get a quick buck. It was bloody and graphic, but I found it predictable, annoying and scary. For me, it would have been nice if this movie contained an original thought. Craven and his son shared the writing assignments, and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror movies, but unfortunately he is not one of them.
