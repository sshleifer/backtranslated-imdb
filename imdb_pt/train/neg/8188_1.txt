The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its concept that if one becomes a saint, he or she and his family and his significant other live forever. Let us forget that in order to become a saint, the saint must be dead and the saints have no significant others. That, for a millennium, Nick was the Jolly Elf for Fred Scrooge is never even insinuated! Open on Nick learning how to make toys, then on Fred learning to spin numbers; Nick gave a sick child a doll, Fred reusing the doll, along with the family farm! After a few more of these episodes, he became the Fred of today, venting his spleen on Siblings Anonymous, while his losing colleagues nodded in empathy. There, I just wrote a plot more cohesive than this idiocy! <br /> <br /> This Santa Claus, who is a "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic outbreak full of the Harpy Queen, a Mega Mall Mall operation , and answers to a council (huh?) that just gave the Easter Bunny its pink egg. Oh, and his right arm is a seductive blonde in a tight mini-dress and wide boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really sent me to the edge was the Slam being # 1 on the Naughty list. Should not a Naughty List be reserved for future Hitlers and Stalins? Children who are the true embodiment of evil? No, for Old Sausage-Fingers, a good boy who attacks because he is unwanted and not loved is the Demonic Seed! <br /> <br /> The nimrods behind Fred Claus should be boiled in their own pudding! Bah!
