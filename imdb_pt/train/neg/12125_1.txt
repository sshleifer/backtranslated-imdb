Why do people who do not know what a specific moment in the past feel the need to try to set that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the landing of Apollo with the sinking of the Titanic and you will have a movement as realistic as this novel made entirely of low quality trash. Is this what kids who were too young to go to Woodstock and who could not make the composition of the school? "I'm going to show these old bad guys, I'm going to put my own movie on and prove you do not need to know about your subject to make money yet!" Yes, we already know that. The only thing I watched this movie was for me, to give me a little insight into the subclass's thinking. The next time I see a bitch in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I'm running to the other side. It is child abuse to allow parents who are worthless to raise children. It is an abuse of the public to simply put Woodstock and moonlanding into a film, as if that meant, ipso facto, that the film portrays 1969.
