Wow!! I am shocked to know that it is a small world and that we are all interconnected. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne put it much better in one sentence. "No man is an island." The performance was not bad. The children gave everything they had, but sometimes the thread got so thin that I could not keep up and the only real "hero" in the movie ends up in jail after being plagued by a maid. I do not know. I just do not understand. Oh well.
