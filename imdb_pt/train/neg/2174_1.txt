It's hard to believe people really like this dreck! I think kids can have fun, but for me it's the kind of movie that parents can not afford. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and possibly the worst actor boy of all time. I'm going to give the director some responsibility for the boy, but it was really painful to watch. I feel ashamed for her now, having people knowing it was her. When she sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn off the sound - so I came here and found out they did it because she won Star Search. I always felt that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to change the name of his wonderful brother, unfortunately lost, and that crap shows why. Zero stars.
