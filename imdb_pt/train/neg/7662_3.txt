This must be my kind of movie. Even if it was a drug, it should still be in my alley; hell, I like movies "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine". I have a crush on my heart for alien / demonic / adventure movies. Let's review it because I decided to watch it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. I am a big fan of archeology, and this movie involves a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality effects. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I usually like. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this movie had potential, at least in the horror movie section of the video store, but the kid did it. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not all of them find it as amusing as I ... I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now for some of the many flaws. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Even if the film as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is really horrible. We're not just talking badly, I'm talking about the appointment of Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I do not know if she is capable of acting, but interpreting the curator of the museum is simply out of her reach ... completely. Watching her trying to get the roll of educated scientist was not much different from what you see watching the montage on bad porn. I mean, this is not bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, she does not get naked, only with a bra in a silly love scene, totally unnecessary. Even with Reid's performance, the movie might have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems to be written by a 10-year-old. I had not realized it was an adaptation of a videogame until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have enjoyed stupidity in real time. The plot goes back and forth from Slater's childhood into an orphanage where he flashbacks from something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life, Slater was recruited by Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts for evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was very rebellious, I guess, you never know, unless it was in one of those narrations that I did during. The film begins with hunting artifacts for Slater, getting his last piece after some negotiations with a "Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiques". I may have the wrong exact quote, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> There is an evil doctor who wants to free some devils on earth (no reason given), experiments with children, super demons / aliens. human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (demonic things can not stand the light of the sun) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save them all. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not even go through them. the clich√© elements. The script needed a lot of rework to narrow the focus and provide SOME depths. I mean, why is this evil scientist so mean? Okay, humans are doomed and he's just trying to save the human race. I think he's infected? How did this happen? Oh, right, he has one of the evil demon's things in a cage and draws his blood to shoot himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where did he get the super-slugs? (Yes, they use the old science fiction bookcase for alien parasites / demons that "fuse" with their host's spine) Of course, Slater is, like Blade, half super-slug powered, but his "slug" did not completely melt due to an electric shock, "thank God. Oh, and people with these "fused" spines have no idea they're half aliens / demons and act like good members of the community until some secret signal is given of where they turn murderous zombies. Yes, we have zombies. <br /> <br /> So much crap that could be fun, but none of it is. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ending is completely stupid, as everything ends up not being that big of a deal to fix in the first place ... at least nothing a little dynamite can not stand. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst thing you'll see, but a really bad movie.
