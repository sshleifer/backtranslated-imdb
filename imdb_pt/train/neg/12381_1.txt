This movie is really vile. He plays with the urban paranoia of the '70s and' 80s and puts it in a school context. I'm not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many people or that schools were not / are not problem areas, but this vile piece of exploration carries the cookie. Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable, but in this case it is not a case of social issues, but a white middle-class student uses it to become the crime boss of his local high school. And of course he knows how to play the system. Does this sound familiar? Yes. This shit is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty job. It is a disturbing brutality, dressed as a social commentary. This belongs to the same category of junk as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on. The only thing remarkable is that Michael Fox was so broke that he had to do things like that.
