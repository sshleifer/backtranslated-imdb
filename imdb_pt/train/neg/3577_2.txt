This old Pia Zadora vehicle followed a familiar formula from Harold Robbins: the ambitious main character sinks into decadence as he seeks the way to the top of some glamorous, randomly chosen world, in this case the film industry. But despite being so stereotyped as to be completely predictable, this movie can at the same time be completely unbelievable. Zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable) never convinces as a writer. One would expect a movie about filmmaking to have some ideas about its own industry and creative process. But the script does not give you any of the qualities that make writers interesting characters in the film: observance, word-skill, a love-hate relationship with one's own creative abilities. Your character is as empty as a donut hole. And that's just a taste of incompetence on display here. The cinematography is so obscure that sometimes it is difficult to see what is happening. And the scenes never get together, so it all seems like a succession of random moments at the bad Hollywood parties. Avoid.
