Many people thought this is a good movie, but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the movie, a spaceship crushed on Earth and some aliens escaped from the spacecraft, so they killed some people on Earth, but for no reason at all. Also, it is in a dark forest, I can not see anything on the screen, I can barely hear the sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days, the predator came to earth, but no one had sent signals to him before that, he should not know what happened on the earth, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator encountered the director of the aliens and killed him for no reason. He was not alive on earth, it's none of your business on the things that happened here. Lastly, the length of the film is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short and can not tell the reviewers clearly about the story. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I do not think this is a good movie.
