Strange ... I like all of this film crew and black humor movies; but he did not like it at all! It's horrible, horrible and certainly not funny at all. Pity can not make a whole movie plot, disgust too. And it was very annoying. Long empty moments fill the film; could have been removed. It should have been in a shorter format, for sure. Maybe I expected a lot from the crew - like saving the movie lol -. It is also filled with clich√©s of characters and situations too much ... I did not understand why people liked ... "Poetry", "hope"; No, Mom, you did not see any of this! ^^ All in all, it is empty and gross, pitiful and hopeless. Oh damn this ........
