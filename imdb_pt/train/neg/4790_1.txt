I hated this movie. The original Phantasma had such a wonderful atmosphere and mystery. Like many horror movies of the '70s, it looked and looked like a scary and unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 1980s, spurred action, but kept that good attention to humor. Unfortunately, the Phantasm III is awful. It tediously explains all the strange happenings in the previous films, which lessens rather than expanding its power. Blatantly disgrace the image of the first Phantasma as a cheap re-enactment of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this film that they look more like domestic pests than death threatening orbs. Hundreds fall from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the wind. No one - the householder, the director of photography, the editor, the director - noticed or cared that they looked so bad? Worse still, Phantasm III features a tacky and bland joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first film. The original Phantom used humor to relieve his relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to create innumerable cheap jokes about Reggie's horniness: several refer to the "flying balls" of the movie ha-ha, oh, I understand, balls. Maybe the team has had fun of these jokes, but they are in us.
