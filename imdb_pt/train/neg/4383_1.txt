Worst bob Hope comedy ever (and this includes some heavy competition). Hope, on an island with sailors, dreams of being in a bathtub with a geisha "driving his ship". Someone has certainly driven this barrier of Hope to the other side of the cliff, since it counts on Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and it still can not laugh or to be animated. Where's Bing Crosby when you really need it?
