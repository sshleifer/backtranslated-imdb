Oh boy, where do I go with this one? Heroic acting, weak plot, stupid deaths, senseless nudity ... <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment ... this is hell. <br /> <br /> Hell. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money, time or life on this evil pit. <br /> <br /> It's just ... dammit this movie is horrible! Tom Savini, why ?! Why would you waste your life on this crap? This movie is not worth it. I'd rather smell crack and crush my head against a wall than watch THIS ... this sinful act again! <br /> <br /> Please accept my advice and stay f @ @ k away from this elephant shit from a movie. Do not you know something? I should not even have to call it a movie! Just stay away!
