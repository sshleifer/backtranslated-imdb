There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this story of slow and wildly uncontrolled revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, the film stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to take revenge on his treacherous wife. Ah, but not by conventional means. She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits the bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice. She wants Nichole (Tuesday) to get close to her ex-cute and boring Stephan Jenkins, who should stay connected to the music - to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good in his few brief moments, and former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison has virtually nothing to do but grimace. Hiltz, on the other hand, comes out at various times as sexy and playful, then evil and dishonest. She also deals with vulnerable and "maybe a little psychotic" as well. She is also very hot (although there are no transvestite shows), so you can understand how she can be able to reach any guy she is targeting. But performance is kind of wasted on this movie, which is not at all cheeky or interesting enough to recommend.
