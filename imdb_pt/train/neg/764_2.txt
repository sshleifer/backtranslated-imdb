The screenplay for this movie from Columbus seems to have come out of a 1980 novel. Movies deeply directed by characters are great, but only if the characters are convincing. And in this film, the only convincing thing was my desire to change channels. The villain's dialogue sounds as if it were written by a novelist novel. The great lieutenant-colonel is not near his famous, amiable, discreet I kneaded; and the victim of the bride / hijacker is a moaning, unidimensional maiden-in-sheer (she flinters in fear at a tiny scalpel in her captor's hand - come on! I could have taken the scalpel from her hand and kicked it no you-know-what in 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would have at least tried to fight or fight at least a little. And speaking of reality ... the story revolves around a kidnapping that is worked out and solved by the police. The police?? Give me some time. Everyone knows that the FBI assumes every case of abduction. This was no Columbus, just a superficial and totally predictable criminal drama with our familiar Lieutenant Columbus written and stretched for 2 hours.
