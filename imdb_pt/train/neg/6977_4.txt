I read all the compliments here and am impressed by the imagination of who loved this movie. I can not say that I found it highly recommend it. Leonard Cohen's soundtrack is not just overly heavy but too dark. The movie seems authentic enough, but something has to happen in order for it to work, and nothing else does: a superficial plot (not a real problem for me), not much character development, nothing thematically. Just walk along. With failures, Cimino's "Heaven's Gate" has some moments of genuine admiration and is a film that I would return to watch earlier. For a brilliant reconception of the West, HBO's "Deadwood" is far superior to "McCabe."
