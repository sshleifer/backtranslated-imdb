From the nepotism capital of the world comes another garbage film in a fantasy wrapper. "CQ" tells a disconnected and disconnected mess of a story that is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures, a baby, and straight man Davies running around trying to make a stupid science fiction movie. I can think of no reason for anyone wanting to spend time with this ridiculous attempt to make movies. (D)
