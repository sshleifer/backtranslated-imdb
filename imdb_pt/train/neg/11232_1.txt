Is very sad. Even though this was filmed with film, I think it smells a little more than movies like Blood Lake, there's nothing out there. The music they play is the funniest thing I've ever heard. I like the brother and sister in this movie. They both do not try hard to look sarcastic when they're saying things like "My friends are going to be so jealous!" Hey, what happens to the killer wearing only the mask in the beginning? This is retarded! I practically ignored the second half of it. My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the ax. Same exact sound for every chop!
