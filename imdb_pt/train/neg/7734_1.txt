This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is weak - I could not even follow it. The performance is of high schooling. The soundtrack is annoying. Attempts of humor are not. The issue is horrible. The credits are still slow - I'd be embarrassed to have my name associated with this film waste. Do not waste your time thinking about this attempt at action.
