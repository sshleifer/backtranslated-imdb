I found the writing in this movie absolutely appalling. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this movie from me rating it 1 out of 10 was the performance of Lacy Chabert, which I found to have played the multiple personalities very well. For me, it was definitely the highlight of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was beautiful as ever, but I found her role pretty dull, so I do not think anyone could say that her acting was great. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> As for the male lead, Armand Assante, his role playing reminded me chiefly of the cheeses doctors of the 1980s. <br /> <br /> All this I could have lived through. However, the terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the psychic and even the role of the psychic were just some of the worst writings I have seen in a long time.
