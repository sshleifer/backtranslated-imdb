I love Alec Guinness. And that's saying a lot after that movie. In fact, he's not bad at it. He just seems to be sideways, be urban and his usual me delicious, but invest nothing. It is obvious that the girl with whom he is matched is a featherweight, even as an inexperienced young Frenchwoman. Sir Alec would not have chosen her when she was young and obviously not very happy about it now. <br /> <br /> The interesting character is the taciturn brother of the strange "Suzanne," another idiot. "Donald" aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. What deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead? Was he in love with his father's lover? Why did he shake Suzanne's hair when she planned to gather the disparate parts of that turkey in the country estate? Or maybe he just had enough of his unpleasant acting. <br /> <br /> The film would have been charming with Guinness and the "older woman" remembering and seeing Paris together. That would have been a great story! Two lovely people experienced in a beautiful city after the destruction of WWII. Why did not someone come up with it? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in "The Card," a little-known movie, but it's worth it.
