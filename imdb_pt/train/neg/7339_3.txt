Maya is a woman without interests. She simply dreams about her life and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled. This could be an interesting topic. That would require a good story, a pleasant atmosphere, and good dialogue. There's nothing like that. This movie is totally annoying. There are only lengths and no climax. The only climax is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I was a huge fan of him, I could not stand this movie. Even he can not make this movie come out. The movie is not as bad as "King Uncle" and if you're a fan of Art-house or something slow, you might enjoy it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching. My recommendation: do not watch.
