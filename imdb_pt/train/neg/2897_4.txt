There is little to get excited about "Dan in real life". First of all, the whole setup is incredibly planned. Did you really believe that during that long conversation in the restaurant, Marie would not have told Dan where she was going? And since Dan spoke during the whole conversation, why would she be so attracted to him? In fact, I never wondered why Marie was so attracted to Dan during the whole movie. He is very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he is really a good boy (for example, he lies to Marie in the bookstore, ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous of a 'blind date' ). There is more trickery, like that ridiculous scene in the bowling alley, where Dan and Marie are caught by the whole family. Yes, this can actually happen. Dan in real life is slow, sociable and manipulative. Even the films of girls like The Jane Austen Book Club score higher than this predictable tearjerker.
