Despite the prodigious numbers and the wonderful costumes, this film is a difficult task to watch. The murder mystery plot is just a vehicle for putting together the musical numbers, but it often takes the process to a staggering halt, in addition to not being too engaging. Although obviously there has been a lot of money spent on them, the numbers are poorly staged and poorly photographed. It's obviously a pre-code movie because girls usually wear very small clothes and there's even a song singing marvels! The performances are all in a note, though it's good to see Carl Brisson in a musical, but when Victor McLaglen, like Lieutenant, comes in for the umpteenth time in search of clues, you may want to throw in the towel or less quickly to the next number. Pity those customers who were stuck in the cinema at their launch though!
