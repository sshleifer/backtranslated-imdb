This movie was pure pain. Sitting in the theater for a few minutes, I wondered when the movie would start. All settings were in place; A typical love story, the characters have to overcome their gaps, the villain has to emerge, but none of this has ever been initiated. When these things happened, I was already bored and the gadgets were completely ineffective. In scenes that required immense tension and buildup, it looked like pictures needed to be cut. Child stuff does not have to be this way. Children's films can be as fascinating and attractive as adults. The excuse, "hey, it's for kids", it's bull. I'll get "Sword in the Stone" any day. That was terrible. I get the feeling that Disney is going to put something up these days. And as for the children, the 10 years I've seen with this will agree ... pure garbage.
