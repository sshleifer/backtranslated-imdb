I really craved this program for two reasons; I really enjoyed Jan Michael Vincent and I'm an aviation madman and I have a serious case of love with helicopters. I do not like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level. The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx several years ago. The only helicopter that was faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. It hit more than 300 and was a composite helicopter, meaning that it had a propeller propeller at the end of its fuselage, providing thrust. <br /> <br /> In short, no helicopter can fly much more than 275 because of the principle of flying wing flight. And Bell 222, the "actor" who played Airwolf, was not too fast even by helicopter standards. And it was not in production for very long. <br /> <br /> There was a movie that came out during that time period called "Blue Thunder" which was much more realistic.
