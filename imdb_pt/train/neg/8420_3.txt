Despite the excellent cast, this is a film nothing remarkable, especially from the perspective of aviation. It may be a bit better than the notorious "von Richthofen and Brown", but not much. "Blue Max" remains the best of a small market in the last 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new high-quality aeronautical film.
