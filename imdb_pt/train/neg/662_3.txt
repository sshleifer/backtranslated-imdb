and rent a good horror movie. It's as if the writer had never seen a horror movie before and did not realize that every single thing he wrote was cliché and banal and was parodied to perfection in films like "Scream" and "Scary Movie." <br /> <br /> <br /> Among the scary bits is the more BANAL and BORING dialogue already written. Stupid "let's go to the ball" rubbish. I wanted to rip my ears out. Honestly, "The Hills" has better dialogue. <br /> <br /> There really was no need to make this movie. The protagonist is uninteresting and I kept thinking "Is she really? The guy is obsessed with her? Really?" <br /> <br /> All the characters act stupidly, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and back! No sleepy cop sitting in your car with the window lowered just waiting for your throat to be cut.) <br /> <br /> The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone which he wants without the slightest problem. No resistance from victims (or doors). No one has any protection or the slightest idea of ​​fighting back (or turning the security lock on the door of the hotel room). People are like sheep with mental disabilities. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you are a gore fan, you will be disappointed too. All the murder is kept off the canvas and is - ahem - done with taste. (So, boo hoo to you!) <br /> <br /> None of the murders is not at all interesting. Most of the time they happened when we found out. <br /> <br /> The only cliché that was missing was the cat that always appears in this kind of movie. "Oh kitty! You scared me! I thought you were the killer - AIIEEEE!" <br /> <br /> And then, in the end, when it's time for the killer to die-well, let's just say it's the easiest and obvious choice. Snoring. <br /> <br /> The audience was mocking and talking back to the screen. It was too dumb to believe and not too scary enough. Do not encourage this kind of lazy film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and by the way - no coronation of a prom king or queen <br /> No tiara <br /> No bucket of blood <br /> <br /> <br /> Save your money and rent " Carrie "or" Friday the 13th "or" Halloween "or" Scream "or" Scary Movie "(any of them) to get a good scare with some original twists.
