Serious HOME ALONE / KID KID hit with character stereotypes bad enough to have the writer sued and then fired. You can see the use of cheeky stunts in almost every scene. Oh, and acting is a drug too. Although I must say that the line: "Sorry, man, I have to give a big time big time" made me laugh a lot.
