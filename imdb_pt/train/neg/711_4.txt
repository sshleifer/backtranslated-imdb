I'm not sure if this is a spoiler; maybe it's a public service. If you're one of those people focused on instant gratification skipping final credits, you'll miss the last line of the end-of-life news announcer's narration, which states that the USA just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7, 1945 to end with World War II. . Here are just a few of the problems to this end: 1) The older viewer should invoke the equivalent of two or three UNHOLY movies in his mind to fill the chasm between the events of the film. and this surprising conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) The average person will actually kick himself for not having "watched" one of these UNHOLY-filled movies in his own head for free, instead allocate time and money to see this UNHOLY video store (or cable). <br /> <br /> 3) This sequence of credits from imagined newsletters may be the first information to which some younger viewers are exposed World War II, leading them to the conclusion that George W. Bush is the most recent heir to the Nazi throne.
