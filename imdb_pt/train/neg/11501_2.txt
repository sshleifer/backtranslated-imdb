A romanticized and completely false view of the unemployment of a middle-class "artist" with a comfortable creation ... Of course the writer-director has never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it. If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages would behave like teenagers, they would not have anger, fear, or frustration, and so on. All the characters live through the day carrying games, boy jokes. They never seek work, they almost never experience rejection or anguish, etc. Living with money is almost like school summer vacation ... Ridiculous. Especially if you compare it with contemporary works of art from the likes of Ken Loach, etc.
