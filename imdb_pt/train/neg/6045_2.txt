This is an interesting idea that went awry. The hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer seem intriguing, but running on "Anamorph" is terribly slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the film except the boring. Death clues are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that connects them is tedious. Willem Dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator, but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit. Several supporting character actors are wasted, including Peter Stormare as art expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as the coroner, and most notably Deborah Harry, who appears on the back of the DVD but has only a few lines spoken through of a cracked door. Not recommended. - MERK
