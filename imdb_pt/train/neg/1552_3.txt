This movie was very well advertised. I am an avid movie goer and I have seen previews for this movie for months. While I was a bit skeptical about how funny this movie would be, my friends thought it would be great and got me excited about it. So I went and saw, I was sunk in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh at most of the things in the movie just so that I did not feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, but I wanted to take my money from the movie! I always go into an open-minded movie, not trying to get into it with high expectations, but this movie was not that funny. Now it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but definitely worth the wait for HBO. If you have not seen many previews for the movie or enjoy very slow and cheesy comedies, you may like it, but for the real comedy fans I'd say pass. Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead !!!
