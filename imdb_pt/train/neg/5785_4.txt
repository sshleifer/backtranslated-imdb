VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A driver (Murray Brown) is attracted to a country house isolated by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and get entangled in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle, but their hosts turn out to be vampires with a frantic desire for human blood ... <br /> <br /> Taking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle started by independent director Jean Rollin in France, and consolidated by the success of Hammer's "Carmilla" series in the UK, VAMPYRES, the most shocking of Jose Ramon Larraz, boosted the concept of Adult Horror much more than the British censors. tolerate in 1974, and his film was cut for almost three minutes in its original British release. It's not hard to see why! Using his gothic theme as a pretext for as much nudity, sex, and bloodshed as the film's short time allows, Larraz (who wrote the script under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements as a backdrop for a languid meditation. About life, death, and impulses - sexual and other - that affirm the human condition. Filmed in a picturesque country house during the fall of 1973, Harry Waxman's astonishing cinematography evokes a gloomy atmosphere of foreboding. , in which the desolate landscape - somber and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz did a similar trick earlier this year with SYMPTOMS, a discreet thriller that explodes in a frenzy of violence during the final reel) . However, despite their pretensions, the fine plot of VAMPYRES and rude production figures will divide the audience from the outset, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and attractive as could be desired, the male protagonist at the time of filming) regretfully is a miscast in a role that should have gone to some twenty-something stallion. An unmissable item for fans of cult films, a fun curiosity for everyone else, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Watch out for silent movie star Bessie Love in a brief appearance at the end of the movie.
