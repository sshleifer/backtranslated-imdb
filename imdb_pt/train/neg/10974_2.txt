I'm Irish and I've lived in Denmark for some time, so I was anxious to get back home last week to be able to see Intermission. And I go on record saying: <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING. <br /> <br /> It's not as bad as "Ireland's Most Fertile Man," but it definitely does not stand up to other Irish films like The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are really funny, like Colm Meaney's American-style garda. But the movie itself is filmed completely wrong. The camera's movement and the constant zoom-in, zoom-out, try to give the film a nervous appearance as if it were a dark drama. But it is not. This is an Irish lock, stock and two barrels of smoking and should be shot like this. It should have smooth movement from one shot to another. The movie looks sloppy and played together. <br /> <br /> The performances are fine given the horrible script. A friend of mine told me that it was as if they had just been with Colin Farrell for a week in Dublin. He gives a decent view as a Dublin Dirtbag, but in no way compares to his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager's husband to a younger woman. I think she should leave her stand-up deplorable and focus more on her acting. <br /> <br /> In the end, this does not meet the expectations set by the Irish press or deserves to be considered one of the best Irish films of all time. <br /> <br /> I'm expecting a negative reaction from these comments because most of the people I talked to said it was great. But before you answer, ask yourself: Would you think of this film so much if it were in England or America?
