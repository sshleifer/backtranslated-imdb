How can you bring together this respectable cast of young British actors and create a pile of film manure? Horrible script, camera annoyingly agitated, horribly edited, terribly misinterpreted. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that "different" sometimes equals "dreck". Why the money that people fail to read the scripts beforehand? Do yourself a favor: spare yourself and do something else - like hitting a hammer on your knees. It's less painful and more fun than this movie!
