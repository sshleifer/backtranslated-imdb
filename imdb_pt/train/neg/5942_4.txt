If this is the black experience, let me out through the front door or back. <br /> <br /> The boy of a mother one day sees two young hoods pass and from then on it is all downhill for him. Angela Bassett, the grace that shines in this film, plays her protective and religious mother. Despite her anger at how her life has turned, in the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept it. She allows her friends to come in and suddenly it is okay to use profanity as long as she is not in front of the children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad state of affairs with regard to gangster rap. You knew where this movie was going. <br /> <br /> I literally laugh out loud when in the end, when Bassett is accompanying his son's body for burial, she states that while her life was cut short at age twenty-four, he became a man. What man? He had been a condemned criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity and despised society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what happens in our schools. The total and absolute lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> The east coast, the rivalry of the west coast gangs is never fully explained. All we see are guns in hand. <br /> <br /> A terrible picture that does nothing to stop gang violence. What horrible models are these rap singers and their obscene music. The African American community should be offended by its own being. Who was this fat, classless guy who portrayed Biggie? It made Rerun's old television program look lean in comparison. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that turned this chubby little boy into the vulgar monster he was. What a sad state of things when this is called cinematic entertainment.
