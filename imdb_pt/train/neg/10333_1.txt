What was an exciting and rather original Fox series turned into winding nonsense. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my "must-see" weekly list, and not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Fox's powerful people decided they needed to "tune" the plot. Within 3 episodes of the season opener, they totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season very ridiculous and amateur. The new plots were lengthening the continuity and credibility of the show. In one episode of season two, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated that she biologically could not sleep. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood never gets): If it works, do not ruin it! <br /> <br /> azjazz
