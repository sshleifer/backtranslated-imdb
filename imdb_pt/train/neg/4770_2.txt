I wanted to like this movie, yeah, it's a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like those movies. If done well it had all the ingredients of being a good movie, not brilliant but good .... unfortunately those ingredients were gone! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the prisoners are presented with their captor one by one (hoods removed), the remarks and a lining are simply terrible, yes I know, poor writing ... but that is more than that, it was poor writing associated with poor performance. Two of the captives were in a relationship with each other and did not even recognize it until much more in the movie ..... Sorry, I'm even wondering why I'm bothering to review this. movie at all. <br /> <br /> I will finish with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTMENT!
