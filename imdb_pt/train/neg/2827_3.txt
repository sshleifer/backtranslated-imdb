The story at the beginning is interesting: slavery in the (late) 20th century, from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that he intentionally punishes two of the favorite enemies of director Richard Fleisher: Arabs and Germans. To make us believe that much Arab men would be free to wander and easily capture blacks in West Africa is as believable as whites hunting slaves in Roots. Obviously, both businesses are / have been run by sites and involve (d) much more sophisticated networks. Although Arab countries are complicit in the trafficking of children and sex slaves today, Israel is one of the worst offenders, according to Amnesty International. So why just point the Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It is obvious prejudice and hatred of these people by a Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The performance is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.
