I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was based on Christian. The director had a good idea / intentions when making this film, but it could have been better. I can understand why someone still has feelings for whom they believe to be the greatest love of their lives. However, I did not understand why the director made his friends so insensitive, mean and rude. The main character continued apologizing to his friends when they were the only ones for him. They understood nothing and used God as a reason to explain their behavior. The main character, no one else knew if the ex-girlfriend was divorced, was still married, but they were against him, solving old feelings that needed to be addressed. His friends should be Christians and should have been portrayed as supporters, agreeing or not with his decision. So many times we do things in life where we do not apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do it, they were all against him. The ironic part was that her new friend accused him of having chase behavior by simply looking for an old friend when she did something very strange to get her name, address and phone number ... she seemed to be the stalker! she did not look like a friend, but only took care of herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with the person they should be with, and I feel that the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like God does not care about true love ... only that you get someone with whom you made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... it's all about the steps you take to make up. As I said, the movie had potential, but I was tired from the unilateral point of view being constantly repeated and jammed in the throat of the viewers by their supposed ... well-meaning friends. This movie did not stay true to the Christian belief of love, but I give it a C for its effort.
