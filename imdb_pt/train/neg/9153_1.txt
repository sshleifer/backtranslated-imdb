I've never posted a review before but I had to do it for this movie! This movie is so bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is, trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it is not. It is truly, without self-consciousness, EVIL. This is a serious attempt that fails gloriously. Other critics pointed out the film's many shortcomings, so I'll try not to repeat them, but I ask you to watch this movie. For all this I was speechless, literally breathless, unbelieving or rolling on the floor in hysteria. I did not have much fun watching a movie in years. In fact, I'm going to try to make all my friends see it, because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - When Arthur wants to be a movie - I'm a boy (his dance is unbelievable) - Free nudity (the principal / actor only had to take a naked picture) - The preacher with his depiction on cardboard and Christ's crayon - Sure, the famous wedding scene with palm trees and rings forgotten (what narrative function does this play?!?) - The ex-wife's fight with Ben to get possession of his gun - The detailed sequence in which Arthur kills the preacher; He apparently burns it with an incredibly despicable match - Yes, gay religious fanatic brother with his discolored hair and clothes WeHo - And, my favorite, use Joplin's "The Entertainer" as opening soundtrack and "Canon Pachebel in D Major "as closing soundtrack! - the list goes on and on - a must see !!!
