I am among millions of people who consider themselves fans of Cary Grant, but I can not think of a single reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand the cast of Betsy Drake and it seems like no one else did, if we want. judging by the small number of movies she played later. <br /> <br /> Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was excellent at chasing and catching Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby.Here the director or writers try to rephrase the idea but fail miserably. I read comments about how " scary "Drake was, but I thought it was a very lightweight description. Franchot Tone passed by this as if he were hung over. A cast disaster is one thing. This movie is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This does not deserve 10 lines of comments and I do not know. why this is a requirement. Too bad this has been preserved when so many valuable movies are rotting in the coffers. <br /> <br /> Unless you want to torture someone, give that person ample space.
