Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an entire empty apartment. They at first help themselves and then slowly the tension between them begins to form. <br /> <br /> This is based on a novel by Bernard Malamud and unfortunately everyone speaks as if they were in that novel. Very little of the dialogue is natural, it is purple and overflowing with nuances of meaning. It's as if an English college student with a head full of pretensions writes the script. It's horrible and I immediately found myself immune to anything the movie had to say, which is a shame, since the movie is full of great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog below are fine shape, unfortunately none of them can come any more to the falsehood of words and the premise. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie. Although not too bad, he is very pragmatic and pretentious, to the point of making you want to get away. I lost interest less than a third of the way and had to struggle to get to the end. If you are interested, I would try cable but would not give good money to see.
