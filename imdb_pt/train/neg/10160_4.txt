A typical Lanza movie that had a limited public appeal with a weak plot that was simply set to justify Lanza's MGM contract at the time. <br /> <br /> As reported by Lastliberal member (above) Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene advances toward her (and sometimes in) camera. Moreover, his mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol on his face during the scenes they did together were intolerable. After making his second (and last) movie together, "Toast of New Orleans", the normally quiet Grayson invaded Louie B. Mayer's office and told him without uncertain words that she would never work with Lanza again ?? period. Mayer thought Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than to Lanza, so Grayson's statement was compromised. Grayson went on to star in a series of widely received (and much more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later, when asked to compare Lanza and Keel, her response was that there was no comparison between them, and that Keel was great at work and had a lot more appeal to "real people" in the audience.
