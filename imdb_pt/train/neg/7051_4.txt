A film about dealing with the problems of growing up and being true to oneself, Blue Juice is a mental sweet for surfers and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the true star of this film, while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addict friend. <br /> <br /> For those who do not like surfing or from Cornwall to the smallest, you'll realize that it takes a long time for the film to suggest being interesting. The beginning is slow and it spends a lot of time on long scenes of only slightly interesting landscapes. In addition, many main characters lead most of them being one-dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea, but because of the superficial characters you have no idea why they act in the situations in which they are placed. <br /> <br /> Only Ewan, Sean and Catherine's characters make it a videotape-worthy film, which is why it was only released on videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached mainstream fame.
