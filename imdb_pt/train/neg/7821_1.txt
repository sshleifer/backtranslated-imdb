Did the filmmakers predict this before releasing it? The script jumps from one place to another without much explanation. The beginning does not clarify whether it is a prequel or not. It starts with the beginning of Superman on Earth and then jumps to a spot after the last movie - but does not really alert the viewer. Very confusing! The superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential home-destroyer, a stalker, and someone clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely contributes to an interesting hero. The ending is absolutely ridiculous. Superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him out of me. I'm seriously waiting for an SNL skit where Superman appears in Maury Povich and Maury says, "The results are in - in the case of the child, Superman, you are the father." To summarize - OK by acting this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The film is basically unwatchable.
