This movie is unworthy of the title of Omen. It is so bad that it has damaged the classic nature of the first three. It should never have been done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> They do not even spell Damien Thorn's NAME correctly !!!! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all Omen films. Pull it off the shelves and burn.
