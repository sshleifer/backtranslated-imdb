I bought this DVD without any previous reference but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on the cover. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to watch waiting for a funny comedy like "Switch". However, meaningless history is horrible and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) undergoes surgery to change his sex in Copenhagen and he returns to Hollywood saying that she must be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claiming half of the property of her uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). Over the course of days, Myra and her alter-ego Myron corrupt a young couple in their uncle's academy with bizarre sex. At one point, the messy script is so confusing that I believe the whole story was just a mental journey of Myron induced by the accident. Unfortunately the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this film. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Man and Woman to a Certain Point" ("Man and Woman to a Point")
