I got into this movie hoping it was really awful. And it was. I really felt sorry for the cast full of stars - Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before she made this movie - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual, but Miranda Richardson could not put in one of the fabulous performances that I know and love her for. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (of the Vicar of Dibley, among others), had about a line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and everywhere, and the mood was ... missing. (However, there was a part of the movie in which Santa enters the home of a Jewish family ... which made me laugh just because his expressions were classic) I do not see this movie unless its only alternative is to have a participation collision with a train (in fact, maybe the train would be better ...)
