I had read some positive reviews of this movie and was really surprised at how terrible the whole thing was. Positioned as a cross between an AIDS-related storyline and some kind of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit" tale, this movie can not always understand what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous sex (although safe) on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon do not seem to have a sex life anymore. When Mark dies, Simon - who has a habit of turning off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and remain a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark returns in a spooky way and thwarts his various encounters, while Simon opens up and admits his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish egoist, it is impossible to feel any empathy for him. most of the film. By the time he should be nicer, it's too late to care. Mark, on the other hand, follows in the footsteps of Demi Moore's "Ghost", crying profusely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There is a bizarre tone of change after Mark returns. Suddenly, we have some useless attempts at humor, like the TV show "Enchanted". But this does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing grows more and more crazy with amateur attempts to shake the strings of his heart. The end, with a golden-muscle angel bathing a tearful mark to the sky as an agonized and distressed Simon says good-bye, is simply stupefied, mainly because it is not intentionally funny.
