I entered this movie thinking that it would be a pure football drama (in the same vein as Remember the Titans); however, I left feeling as if I had just attended Ted Haggard's sermon on the rapture. The only thing missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie. In fact, it would probably take more of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment. At least with the televangelist sermon, there are quotes from Scripture instead of quotes from the popular self-help pulp. The plot was totally predictable to the point that anyone with a sufficiently long attention could have planned the whole plot in the first 15 minutes of the film.
