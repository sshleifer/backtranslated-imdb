What an insult to the film industry of SA! I have seen better films SA. The comments I read about Hijack Stories, saying they are worth ten in ten, are quite scary. The rating of a movie should not depend on .., "OH, A MOVIE FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. LEFT TO IMPULSE YOUR INDUSTRY BY SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT YOUR JOB, EVEN THAT IT IS BAD." We have the knowledge to make good movies. Do not judge the film industry on what people are saying about how big they think Hijack Stories is. We can tell great stories, such as Cry the beloved country and Shaka Zulu. Cry the beloved country I'll give 9 out of 10. Great direction by Darryl, great acting by two great old actors regardless of where they are. Hijack Stories .., I'm going to give 1 out of 10. It could just be people involved in the project that would give high scores. I would have done the same if it was my movie.
