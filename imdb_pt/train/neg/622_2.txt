This movie is so aggressive. The main character seems to be 35 years old and I've seen skeletal masts with more balls than this guy. The plot twists are so predictable that it's not even worth watching the mood factor. Also some of the worst dialogues I've heard in 3 years, "Let's find a little animal to torture." <br /> Ugh ..... I can not even continue, I do not see that pile of garbage, it was done in 8 days. <br /> <br /> The only highlight is the drunk guy calling the main character a drawing for photos. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, unwatchable
