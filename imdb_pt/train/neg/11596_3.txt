"The Dream Child", 1989, is the fifth film in the series "Nightmare" (usually overrated) and, at the latest from now on, the series has become total garbage. The only good films in the series were the original Wes Craven in 1984, and the third part, "The Dream Warriors" of 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and was the fourth part in which the crazy Freddy Krueger began to bother with constant idiot jokes. This fifth installment for the series has pretty much nothing to recommend except visuals (admittedly great), and a scary scene, a flashback sequence of how Freddy Krueger came into being. The rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clad maniac who screams nonsense and the old formula of a bunch of teenage idiots desperately trying to avoid falling asleep, because good old Freddy is waiting for them in his life. dreams Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, like a "scary" childish rhyme is added for no other reason than having some kind of justification for making this sequel superfluous and boring. .. In summary: No originality, just a decline of the old formula and an overload of painfully irritating jokes. My (generous) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals and especially to emphasize the difference to the next terrible sequel, "Freddy's Dead," which is unbelievable. In case you are not a hardcore hardcore enthusiast Freddy Krueger, "The Dream Child" should be avoided, and even if you are, it is more than likely to disappoint.
