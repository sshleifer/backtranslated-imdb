SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> It's not really a very good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers made it look pretty good considering the small budget that they had to work with. The movie is apparently an "episode" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several competitors into a sealed "danger zone" and has three costumed idiots sent to kill them. The survivor, if any, gains fame and fortune ... everyone just ends up dead. The main disadvantage of this film is that the acting is very bad. None of the "real" people seem true. The actors who play the killers are fun ... because they're portraying cheesy and exaggerated caricatures of popular types of modern horror movies ... and that's exactly how they would be made if it were a real show. The film pretends to be done all at once ... there is a cameraman who follows the competitors around the "danger zone" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights keep on and off constantly (to hide the "cuts" from one outlet to another, I imagine).
