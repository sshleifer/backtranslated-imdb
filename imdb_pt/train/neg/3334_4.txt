This scared the hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more fun than scary, but with some rather disturbing moments and a kind of despicable quality that I like. And, come to think of it, the plot is a bit disgusting, actually ... but treated with some kind of flavor. If there is a problem with this movie, it's that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. In addition, the ending continues forever, making a potentially tense climax look silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The "monster", after exposed, is not very scary, unfortunately. The somewhat monotonous look of the movie also works against it, making it appear like a TV movie more than something made for the movie theaters. But it's an example of movies that are rarely made today, so I'm asking horror fans to watch and feel a bit of nostalgia ...
