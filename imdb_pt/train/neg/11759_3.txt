For those looking for a sequel to the South African miniseries of the 1980s, that's not it. Nor is it a historical drama. On the contrary, it is a sad little fantasy that has nothing to do with historical Shaka but uses only his name to give a certain prestige to Sinclair's idiotic story about an African superhero who is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. On the other hand, there are some moments of laughter, like when Shaka breaks the cross on which he is chained and kicks a serious slave back. You know, as Jesus would have done if he had not been so weak. <br /> <br /> True, I saw only the 98 minute version, but I can not imagine double that crap. It would have been better. <br /> <br /> And what kind of name is Mungo?!
