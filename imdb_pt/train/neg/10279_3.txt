This movie was so terrible that it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp really did perform well (especially at the end). The character Marjorie, a drunken lady, also loved watching. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without a terrible song of singing and chic piano. Admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are very catchy (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it's horrible! We think it can be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).
