This film about government's secret mental experiences and the corrupt use of citizenship by shadowy, secret figures had the potential to be a really interesting film. But for me, it failed. I will not elaborate much on the rather confusing plot, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the user comment "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it. <br /> <br /> But it did not happen. work for me. I found it slow, which would be nice, but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. The viewer is left in the dark about a lot of things to really be able to deal with this movie - in some films, it could be argued that filmmakers intended to provoke thought and leave things ambiguous for that reason. I do not think that's the case here. <br /> <br /> As for the frequent long plans of two buildings that have often been mentioned by other users ... I see they have a point - they give the viewer time to take another drink without losing the "action" . And I suspect many viewers would like the opportunity to have several drinks onboard to get through this.
