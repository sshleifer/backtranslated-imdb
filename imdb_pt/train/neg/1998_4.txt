My roommate picked up the soundtrack of No, No, Nanette as a stunt double on a tape and she began to hear it non-stop. After he finally brainwashed me, I found the songs irresistible, especially the famous ones, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But because of the soundtrack I had no idea what the movie it was about. Then the other day I saw a copy in the video store and rented what was supposed to be a lost version of the movie. I was thinking it would be awesome, because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately most of the songs I loved were nowhere on the video I saw. Now I've never seen the 1930's version of the musical, but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and virtually no dancing and besides the sound was really bad and you could not understand what people were saying too long. Really the only highlights of this movie were the outrageous fashion of the 1940s. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stand out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has that bizarre feather feather she holds on her forearm and then wrapped herself in that scarf. The dance sequence is a bit awkward too with Nanette doing this weird ballet material with pinup girl images superimposed on top of her. In fact, another bright spot in the film was the artist Guillespe, who dreams of being a good artist, but is currently doomed to draw pin-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe maintains the old school, and he tells Nanette when his masterpiece, the piece that made his career, is sold by Nanette for only $ 5,050. Does not she realize that this play was her immortality? Bunny / silly girl with her feather bunny ears in her hat. When will you learn? Why does not he just write a cigarette before the advertisers take the job away?
