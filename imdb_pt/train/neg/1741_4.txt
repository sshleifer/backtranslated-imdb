The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combination was gilded before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I got into the movie (in an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the good promises. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before, this movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others have commented, the premise of the film, which was already obsolete, begins to spread without any development. or additional layers. After a while, you just want the movie to end so you can go home (if I were watching it at home, it would have been a lot easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is, at best, medium and John Abraham should not attempt to do comedy again. The comedy aspects of the movie in general were quite a week. I just remember laughing like double the whole movie. Definitely no belly laugh that consumed me in HERA PHERI or, even, to a lesser extent, in the AWARA PAWLER DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classic moments, but overall, because his role and character did not have much room to grow, he did not make much of an impact on this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who makes only one appearance in the movie, was fun to watch while she was on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, you'd better just pass this movie on.
