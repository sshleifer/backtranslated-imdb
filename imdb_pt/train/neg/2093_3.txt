If you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you, as much as I worry, it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I can not watch it anymore. It's boring and slow and for a show that the schedule is based 100,000+ years ago if you found it on the battlestar galactica timeline for having arrived ashore they surely seem to have everything the same around as the 100,000 year old Chevy vans which drives down the streets and people watching the 100,000 year old popular brand of LCD TVs. Also happens the same with the rest of the sets and also on the show, there is just too much of the material today wrapped in it to not go unnoticed, I think they could have done a much better job to get around those problems and yes battlestar galactica had some the same problems, but not so bad. Like the rest of the show, it's not as good as BSG and it's a bad pre-sequel?
