Wow, I love and respect pretty much everything that David Lynch did. However, this movie is similar to a first filmmaker's attempt to make a pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> To give some examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is typically a visual filmmaker; however, this had little visual artistic content (blank walls, "shots up" with the ceiling in the background). <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch usually takes pride in the audio, however, you can hear the buzz of the camcorder. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's very hard to swallow the idea that it had anything to do with this movie. unless ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke, on David's part, to force fans to search your site (for hours) just to find out about this nonsense. I hope so, because at least that idea is funny.
