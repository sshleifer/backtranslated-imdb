Previous reviews have made me write this. He says that Muslims are blond and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist. Look, race is nothing. I'm colorblind. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. I might add that I'm not 100% Serbian, that I have some Austrian and Croatian blood inside me, but what's the point? Am I black, half-breed? Anyone who uses racial prejudices with as much malice as Lantos (producer and director is racist to me). Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman, they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. I am proud of being Serbian and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croatians, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes, I am from Serbia and I have a multiethnic family). This film does not show Serbian or Croat sufferings in Sarayevo, terrible street gang terrorism, Muslim extremism. I add: I kneel and pray for all the innocent Muslim sisters and brothers, Catholics or Orthodox, killed in this war. This film is manipulation with our misery, false humanitarianism that does not help at all. Help Lantos fill his pockets with more doe, alright!
