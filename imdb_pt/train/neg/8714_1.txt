I just could not stop laughing !! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But, it does not matter, it's a lot of fun! In this movie, you do not need to pay attention to anything! The performance is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh my, I could see the stick holding the T-Rex's head for a moment). The kidnappers are the same as the Carnosaur 2, the T-Rex is also the same, but ... some scenes, his head seems a little clogged and looks like some kind of flaw in the kindergarten project. The action is fast, sometimes very fast, actually I talk about quick editing, they edited so fast, so we could not see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! until late, they are rubber! Well, the only interesting thing here is to see Rick Dean in this sequence. <br /> <br /> What I can say ... do not rent ... watch TV, with friends, it's much more fun!
