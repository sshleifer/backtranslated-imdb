Just for Judy Garland fans. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one where she makes a number with an older cleaner (you all saw the pictures), and a pretty good number in the end. There are some scenes where the lines are funny. But basically the script is so bad and the film so dated that it's hard not to be scared by the horror. But it's worth 2.50 renting the movie - just be prepared to move quickly.
