I do not understand the positive comments made about this movie. It's cheap and nasty on all levels and I can not understand how it's ever been done. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters abound - the Irish father is a prime example. None of the characters are remotely friendly - except, briefly, to Sue's Asian boyfriend, but even he ends up being capable of domestic violence! As desperately uninteresting as the two of them are, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue would shoot down an accomplished idiot like Bob - but why, then, should I care what happens to them? So many comments keep insisting on how "realistic" it is. If this is true, it is a sad reflection on society, but there is no reason to put it in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie.
