I was interested in the Big Rig title and description while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was eager to get out of the seats as soon as Big Rig finished. The Big Rig is made up of several "big rig" drivers who depart to deliver goods driven in the United States. The characters are all wonderful, but filmmakers have never plunged into their complexity as people. Instead, history snakes as much as the maps in the movie serve to guide, but never do. At most we get lost. We - the audience - ended up going nowhere and, like the direction of the narrative, we ended up somewhere, but with no direction, location or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? Storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intention to "humanize" a group of people they consider "neglected" and "invisible" is unconscious and irritatingly condescending. The problem here is from the perspective of the directors rather than the truck drivers. The directors bring their own naive assumptions about the truckers and then simply edit the film to confirm these assumptions. Overall, the story does not have any tension, the film is very long (it should have been a 15 min sketch), the big question of "And so" is never answered, and the whole film is a transparent advertisement that does nothing to "clarify" (as the directors would say) the outside world over great builders.
