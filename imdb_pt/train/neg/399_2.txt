This photo began with good intentions, Bacon the scientist, to test the theory of invisibility, and Shue is cute, as usual, in his role. It all collapses after that, it's your typical Hollywood thriller now, filmed in a studio with plenty of special effects, minus any kind of humor, humor or soul. In other words, do not waste your time watching this. Take the cassette tape with John DeLancie as the Invisible Man, also starring Leonard Nimoy. Now that was good, and HG Wells is well served, unlike this mess.
