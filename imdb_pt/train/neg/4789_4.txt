"Phantasm" from 1979 was a highly atmospheric horror movie, scary, scary and very original, and in a word, cult. The first sequel of 1988 was bloody, witty, action-packed and very entertaining. After the first sequence, the creator of "Phantasm" Don Coscarelly apparently had no new ideas. "Phantasm III - The Lord of the Dead" 1994 certainly is not a complete failure, it's even fun, but there is more originality, and desperate attempts to bring something new, sometimes tiring, which makes it rather disappointing compared with its predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> Right in the beginning, we are introduced to the secret behind the mysterious sentry balls (flying silver balls that suck the brain) are unraveled. From then on, a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters (such as Tim, a "Home Alone" kid who happens to be great at filming, a Rocky, a tough guy and super cool black chick with a team cut) are featured . The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as the ponytail guitar playing Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still quite scary as the Tall Man, but the fact that Tall Man talks a lot more in this movie, makes him lose some of his strangeness. Mike's character is played by A. Michael Baldwin again (he had been replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), which, in my opinion, does not make much of a difference. Blood also keeps the film interesting enough to watch, but it's still a disappointment, especially as attempts to make up for the lack of ideas become annoying quickly. <br /> <br /> All things considered, "Phantasm III" is an acceptable waste of time, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two "Phantasm" movies can try it on, but I recommend not letting your expectations go too high.
