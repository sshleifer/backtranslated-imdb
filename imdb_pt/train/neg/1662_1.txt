This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes your TV movie run look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on a book by the one and only Britney Spears and her mother, this is rubbish with nothing to hinder Virginia Madsen's reasonable performance (hopefully you've been paid well) to save him. The story of a red-neck gill who wins a scholarship at a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal Spears' music to the consumer and generally agree that the low brow should be the way. There's nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as the next night. Never again.
