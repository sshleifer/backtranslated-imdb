Oh it really is. I've seen movies that I did not like anymore, due to any reason, but I've never seen a movie that fails in every aspect of cinema. He even fails to fail in the production of films, in a way that can be said that the Hercules in New York does. It's not the movie I least like, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is the first thing that strikes you. I've never seen a worse acting movie out of porn. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic movies that work much better than that. It's really awful. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. Camera work is amateurish. Editing is meaningless. I presume they could not afford the proper sound equipment, and that meant that every scene in a car (and there are a lot of them) makes them drive at about 5 miles per hour and all scenes out of the same stretch of forest there are many of them too) is actually dubbed a studio, again lending more to the bad porn vibe. <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd, as many have pointed out. I will defend vampires by walking in the light of day because, despite being popularized by Nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of vampire myths. <br /> <br /> Speaking of vampire myths, the writer evidently read Carmilla. , or at least seen The Vampire Lovers. I do not know how I feel about it, convinced that such a terrible film has at least some aspirations for a gothic novel I like very much; or bored by their references, at best, and at worst, total desecration of the source material. At the very least, "the General" is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> I got two stars though, simply because I can not vote for a star for a movie that has, or at least proposes to have, both vampires and zombies. Incidentally, I watched Lifeforce (another movie that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it) on the same day as this, and despite being a rather flawed movie in itself, it really comes out a masterpiece in that regard. <br /> <br /> So in the end, this is not such a bad movie that it's good, or so bad that it's somehow nice, even drunk. It's just a mess and not worth watching.
