Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future of War a run for his money as the worst movie ever made. This is fun to laugh at, where Manos was painful to watch. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term: "80's cheeze". The acting (and I'm using this term loosely) is atrocious, the Hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you've ever seen, and the garden tools fight has to be seen to be believed. The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and that version is the only way to watch this mess. This movie gives Mike and the bots lots of ammo to pull some of the funniest they've ever done. If you try to watch it without Mike's help and the bots ..... God help you!
