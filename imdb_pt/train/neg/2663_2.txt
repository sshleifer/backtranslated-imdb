In an interview, David Duchovny said he was not able to watch even the first hour of this movie - and neither should you. The scene in which he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed, if he can look around - change the name he gives and he could have raised his performance from almost any episode of the X-File. He's on autopilot throughout the film. Brad Pitt is overwhelmed.
