As usual, I was really looking forward to a new TV / movie about a favorite subject of mine - makes a nice change from an * strangely familiar * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel. I eagerly looked forward to Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates - but it was rudely brought to Earth with the perception of the malevolent and stupid power of Hollywood - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on So once again I was excited about 'The Rise of Evil, especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved, since I liked his books. I can see why he gave up. <br /> <br /> To quote a guy responsible for this rubbish: <br /> <br /> "Kershaw's book was an academic piece," he said. "It was very dry. We needed more incidents." <br /> <br /> Incidents? Are they totally crazy? Hitler's life can not be said to be without 'incidents' - yes, Kershaw's two Hitler biographies were long and detailed, but they should be. <br /> <br /> The thesis behind Rise of Evil seems to be: Hitler was a very bad man - no, he was a very bad man who hated Jews, and just in case you miss it, let's emphasize the fact in all the scenes of the movie. There was no effort to explain the climate of the time, and why Hitler could have adopted the visions and strategies he made. Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent "Nazis - a warning of history" - this film neglected the fact that almost all the leaders of the communist uprising in Munich were Jews, and that this may have colored their opinions on the subject. - and its axiomatic linkage of Jews to Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect of understanding much of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding to be done - the filmmakers would not go there, so we just have all the things we knew anyway. Certainly we do not have the fascinating fact that Kershaw alludes, that Hitler was for a short time a socialist / communist immediately after the First World War. Of course, that would be too complex for the film, and could even lessen the relentless mantra "it was too bad," which beats incessantly. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a fascinating figure, both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic, and of course adopted some visions such as vegetarianism, anti-alcoholism, and anti-smoking with which many Guardian readers might agree. He was also famous for liking animals, hence why that wholly invented whipped dog scene was so absurd. <br /> <br /> He was also, of all the reports I saw, a brave soldier in the First World War. While we saw him with his Iron Cross, we could never see how he won (acts of bravery were not in the script, needless to say). We also have no idea why he was so enthusiastic about his war experiences, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and so many others found such a repulsive experience. And again, as in the point above the Jewish-Bolshevik bond, this is vital for anyone's understanding of the subject. Why does he love war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite evidence to the contrary? Why did not he care about colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but still drew the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly has nothing of interest to say about it either. <br /> <br /> As often these days, the film is a classic example of "making history relevant to the present" and inventing things or letting strange facts out to fit in with "the present" - which is often to meet the lowest common denominator where you dont trust your audience an inch, so you're just going to stuff things into their throats, knowing (with sadness correctly) that you're always going to get on with it because there are so many idiots idiots in the world . <br /> <br /> The story is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colors our present, for better and for worse. This rubbish was a great opportunity, lost again. They spent millions on it, and the local and big scenes were impressive, but they did not tell us anything we did not already know, and did not promote any understanding of this dark period of human history. <br /> <br /> WT
