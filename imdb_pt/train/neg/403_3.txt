Another violent and angry fantasy of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is an enigma: it is hard to say whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with a sardonic intent, or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the bright visuals of the world (and this has some outstanding ones) can not hide a neglect in history, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovered invisibility and uses it to lead to moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a friendly actor who occasionally shows his dark side ("The River Wild") in an attempt to compensate for his boyish appearance; Given the material, however, Bacon is not hateful enough enough to force. The other directors are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, none of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver empty dialogues, are embarrassed. The climax is a study of preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended.
