Many King fans hate this because they have moved away from the book, but the film is a different medium and the books must change when they make the leap. Nevertheless, the film fails completely, but fails completely in terms of film. I'd like to hit people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow with the question "Really ... exactly what scene scared you?" Every fan I asked for is silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent fright (there are none ...), names the shtick "grape juice-shot-of-lifts". If you're afraid of this, I do not know what to tell you, except maybe you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes observing these z-grid terror ideas in this clich√©, incoherent movie. <br /> <br /> A place that deviates from the book and is really tasteless is the tedious work that the film does to get Mr. Halloran to Overlook just to kill him; with the most idiotic member of the public knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the hallway that leads Halloran FOREVER down. Really one of the most stupid sequences ever put on film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and good choice for Mr. Halloran Stanley's artwork! Afro-nymphomaniacs of black light really contribute to the climate and the development of a horror film. Has there ever been a filming more "out of place", out of place in any movie ever made? <br /> <br /> I think it's a miracle to get around this bullshit and agree that Kubrick 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense "ill will" generated by both this stupid and stupid movie, and by the cult of the fanatical boys Kubrick, but disjointed, who could not describe an idea in action with all cinematographic resources. the Library of Congress in front of them. <br /> <br /> Play the grotesque overcoming of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of stupid sentences into tense moments, and the performance of Shelly Duvall, nominated for Razzie, and you will have a very bad movie.
