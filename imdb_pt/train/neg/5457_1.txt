An actor asks, "What is my motivation?" To understand his or her character. After seeing this "docudrama", this vague and casual farce, a spectator wonders what motivates someone. <br /> <br /> This inept offspring of daytime TV (the Oprah show) has missed for a mile the great opportunity to explore heavy issues. Their characters were all shallow and shallow, their story line much less socially redeeming than an episode of "Simpsons." He portrayed, free of charge, investigating the police as unprofessional and incompetent. It was not possible to explain why the court could treat the main character, a female molester, so differently than would a male perpetrator. <br /> <br /> Why did this unrepentant woman start "rearranging" her sophomore? starting an affair with him when he came back to sixth grade class? Why did the boy's mother witness in his name? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, in addition to generational rationalization and greed. The film did not give any indication of this. <br /> <br /> Why was the viewer not informed that the victim's mother sold the interview rights to the press and television tabloids, parading her teenage son on "The Today Show"? That Mary Kay's lawyer made money, herself appealing to the "Son of Sam" Statute so she could benefit from the crime by selling her story to the highest bidder? Why was it not explained that LeTourneau's father was a former right-wing Republican congressman, the 1972 United States presidential nominee, the president of the John Birch Society? In 1983, John Schmitz's political career ended when he discovered having had children from his own community college student, exposed only when that lover sexually mutilated her newborn son? However, Letourneau's father had removed his many children from "very liberal" Catholic schools, struggling to keep all students from receiving sex education? <br /> <br /> One month after her conditional release, she is again pregnant at age 14 now. Second high school daughter, Mary Kay received seven and a half years in prison for numerous probation violations. A prophetic editorial on the sad case appeared in the Seattle Times: "At the end of two miserable hours, LeTourneau was taken to jail, and this melancholy mix of television teasing was over, until the cast." <br /> <br /> Of course, 18 months later, the filming of this farce was under way.
