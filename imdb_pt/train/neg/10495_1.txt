I think the Croc Hunter is a really cool guy! I know I would not have the guts to go five feet away from a croc. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. Fart jokes, people being eaten and the satire about the president make the movie one of the worst ever. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad movie from which you have to stay away. All the "jokes" are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat it after he saw it.
