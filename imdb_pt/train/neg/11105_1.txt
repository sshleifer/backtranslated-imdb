It did not make sense and it was so horrible ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movie like this ... you do not watch. people cutter or eater what should I say ... that made me sick! Oh my gosh! movie is about people we do not know, but they feed on humans! they have teeth, bla bla bla ... is not this familiar? I can bet you saw it in another movie. The cast was so good, but I think the setting was really awful. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was totally amazing ... he's so talented ... actually I said horrible, but I think because of horrible scenes ... let me explain. Did you eat your tongue? but in the movie a person did it! was really horrible ... anyway I think the movie would be so good without that horrible human eater or cutter scenes ...
