Ben Stiller does not act much like reacting. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. In There Something About Mary, the hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep his face serious. When he confronts the other two suitors of Mary, he is the most unusual guy in the room, but the scene is hilarious. <br /> <br /> In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to understand. Stiller is surrounded by a set of comedic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which few are. That said, Hoffman relies a little too much on body humor - you know we're in trouble when they go to fart jokes to laugh. A basketball scene in which Hoffman deepens it is completely exaggerated (though creating a situation in the form of a shirtless opponent who creates a smile - noticeably through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. The characters of Hoffman and Stiller could have touched much, much more. Aniston again reprises her role as Rachael, but Stiller is not Ross. It's more of a scenario "Joey with a crush on Rachael". <br /> <br /> Polly is a rom-with-by-the-numbers and that is her fault - heart failure. You do not support the characters. With a little more work, we could have a deeper story, but in the end the failure of the film comes down to poor writing. It is worth watching if you show up on TV on a slow night, but you will regret spending money to watch it.
