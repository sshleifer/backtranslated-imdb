This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Falk and equally glorious Olympia Dukakis. That would have been a movie worth seeing. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser vehicle, with a bit of Falk played. The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but you would hardly know that. I assume that Reiser has the impression that he is a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle. He is not. Even more annoying is that Reiser went to the trouble of hiring some of the best female character actresses on the screen today and then pushed them into his past. Dukakis does not appear until the last 15 minutes, but when she appears, the screen shines. The story is about Falk and Dukakis in fact, but we are subject to a senseless, foolish and absurd journey in which Reiser manages to show how she is very cute, precious and profound with the psychological insight (wrong!) That he can be. For example, in a restaurant scene that I imagine that Reiser expected to be "like a Cassavetes" there is a ridiculously false confrontation between Reiser and Falk who is so patently ridiculous, I was ashamed by Falk.
