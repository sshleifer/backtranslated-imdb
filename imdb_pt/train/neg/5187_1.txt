I will not approach and criticize RAW theories. I mean, this is a site about movies and whether or not the movie is well-done, not a site debating philosophy. <br /> <br /> That said, this video really succeeds. It's a RAW photo after another. Some of them are archiving, so you can see how it has aged over the years, and that's pretty cool. But otherwise, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's a strange comparison, but I kept thinking about Sunday afternoon when I saw some of the vehicles of the star of Barbra Streisand * Funny Lady * (another bad one). After a while, I got so excited about Barbra, I was wishing there was a scene where she did not show up: you know, "meanwhile, other characters in the movie were up to something different ..." Moment. But it was all about Barbra. Well, this video is from * Funny Lady * from RAW. So if your idea of ​​a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the RAW face as it chatters with your theories, gathered in a lame frame that adds no interest or insight, then be my guest. For me, I could not stand it after 20 minutes.
