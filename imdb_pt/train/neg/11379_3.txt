When I first saw a little scene in some ads, I thought the show would be fun to watch. The little robot boy looks cute. The style of animation seems familiar for some classic shows. Before the show went on the air, I studied through some sources. There, I was a bit discouraged. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are dubbed appropriately, but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been much better if he had been portrayed by a young boy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "Whatever Happened To Robot Jones?" The show is not bad at all. But the way Robotboy is portrayed inappropriately is my only criticism. So, I do not watch much.
