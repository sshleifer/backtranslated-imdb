Another extremely unprofessional movie about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> It seems that the authors of this film do not know the world of the programmers. <br /> <br /> 20 best programmers in the world, program that has its own satellites (for what?), program that uses freq. satellite, someone kills somebody to steal the codes (why?) and a lot more of stupid moments in this movie. <br /> <br /> People who do not programmers will not see something horrible in this movie because they do not pros on it. But people will not see the real things. <br /> <br /> Programmers will find this movie strange and horrible - because so many moments within the movie are not related to real life (why not film, in this case, scifi?).
