"The Cat's Meow" contains some scenes that have a smart dialogue, and some great performances, some of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to an excellent hair job and makeup by a talented designer); Joanna Lumley is convincing as a novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst is winning as Marion Davies (although the films never use their real-life stuttering is hard to explain). But these elements do not contribute to a successful whole. The writer seems to have worked hard on certain scenes - the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well worked - but not as hard on the big picture. Several minor characters need not be there and do not behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogia (eg, why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he does not really want to hear?), And the party scenes are repetitive and tiring. I would like to think that a trip on the Hearst yacht was more fun than the movie indicates. Davies is characterized as a kind of Bubbly Flapper pattern, which is not really accurate, and the writer's ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed so attached to the 1930s in "Paper Moon," does not have a similar affinity with the twenties. He insisted that the excellent costume designer wear only black and cream, which gives party guests a very artificial appearance, and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period (eg "Yes, We Have No Bananas"). When Hearst insists everyone "Charleston, Charleston!" it seems the actors had a ten minute dance class just before the scene was filmed. <br /> <br /> The life of silent movie stars can make fascinating movies, I'm sure, but not this time.
