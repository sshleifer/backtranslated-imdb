At first, I was convinced that this was a TV movie that was not worthy of primetime. But after a few minutes of stupefied admiration, I realized that there was at least comic value in the exaggerated acrobatics and the acting in the movies. This movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and I had not laughed so much while we watched in amazement that the actors could keep a serious face. It was like a less funny spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so hard that I actually bought the Big Hit DVD) with even worse acting. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, not Jim, after all the hugs and compliments. Some rum and soft drinks will definitely help get you down more easily.
