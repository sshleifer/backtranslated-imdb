This movie is just lame. A total waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so clich√©d and the way you talk about RPG players is not funny either. The problem is that writers do not seem to know how an RPG game works and, more importantly, how to make jokes about that game. Of course there are a lot of losers who play RPGs as retarders and total losers. But for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story makes no sense. Who cares how long a game is being played? The biggest problem in this movie is that writers and actors have not even tried to know what the RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt embarrassed to watch this lame movie.
