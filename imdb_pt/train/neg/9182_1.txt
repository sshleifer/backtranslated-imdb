Just like everyone else has said, the acting is horrible, with no story or anything, bad direction. On SFX, the 360-degree, 1-shot dot matrix style shot is pretty stupid, but for every character. I mean, come give me some time. And what about all those video game scenes, just to remind us that it's a "video game adaptation"? Jesus, they should have fired anyone who thought of this idea. <br /> <br /> 0.00001 / 10
