What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say, I'll just watch this movie again if I'm stuck in a chair and have my eyes open in the orange-clock style. The film stars Robin Dunne (No, I've never heard of him either, whose horrible impression of Ryan Phillipe made me shudder everywhere.) In a terrible cast affair, Dunne tries (and fails) to continue with a lovely charismatic and charming Amy Adams, (she was in a buffy episode once), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar stopped and bring Katherine planning for life .. As the actor is not handsome, neither charismatic nor charming, the character is totally unbelievable. "Adams is not as good as an actress and her performance was flat and devoid of any real emotion, she often seemed to be reading cue cards just off the camera.There were two good actors in the film, however, Barry Flatman Saw 2 and Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Ms. Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and fun performances like Sebastian and Katherine's parents and are the only reason I rated the film as a 2, not a 1. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a poor version of the original, with notes as low as dialogue and imitates scenes that did not have the originality of the previous film. <br /> <br /> I think, like a TV show, it might have worked, but if it had been reworked with people who could actually perform in the main parts.
