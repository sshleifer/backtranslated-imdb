This was not the big disaster I was hoping for, but that's as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. I'm not sure what should be funny about this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I do not think it's funny to see idiots living their idiot lives or playing the fool on TV, but then again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic daytime talk show. I was not really bored watching this, but I definitely was never liking it, either. If you are in the mood to see a bad movie but that is not too painful to sit in, this is a good choice.
