I think Phillip Kaufman read the Notes version of Kundera's novel and then started doing that movie. Ok, of course it will not have the effect of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to get in and out of the stories he builds. This movie does not even try! The sequence of a dream of Tereza, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense at all. Also, and this is perhaps a minor point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know that's not really a valid claim, but hey). A perfect example of the Hollywoodization of otherwise excellent literature.
