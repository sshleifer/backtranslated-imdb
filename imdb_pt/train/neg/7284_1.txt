Wow. I read about this movie and it sounded so horrible that I had to see it, and my God, I can smell it in St. Louis. Where do I start? The National Lampoons were trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of Animal House, but they completely missed the mark. I go chronologically with these short films. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon of the Animal House). Apparently, he was not working at the time, so the guys at National Lampoons probably called and said "hey, we're making a movie c ** ppy, did we want to participate?" Peter was like "well, I'm not doing much these days, why not?" He was a big side character in Animal House, but he could not stand this little flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is funny enough, with Jason Cooper (Riegert) telling his wife to leave him, she needs to meet. It is very strange that they are actually in a happy marriage. Then he pursues her, there she goes and Cooper is in charge of the children. This, of course, leads him to set fire to the house, lose several children and sleep with a variety of New York bimbos (including one so young Diane Lane). Then the wife comes back, wants the kids, and the movie ends with a coin flip that will decide the fate of the children. The idea was really clever, but the director stank. All the characters seem to be sleeping, they had to be doped. Sorry, Boon, your legacy has been tarnished with that failure. <br /> <br /> Short film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Enter the Dominique Corsaire. Beautiful girl, recently finished college, not sure what to do with her life. So she becomes a slut, starts sleeping with some mega rich guys, gets her money when they die, and she does not stop until she lies with the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean the president of U.S). Once again, it could have been funny, and although I was happy that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) was not afraid to find out everything, her acting was horrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe I've come this far. Here's rookie cop Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, na√Øve, thinks he can really help people, despite becoming cynical after being shot a thousand times. Nagurski, in fact, just gave up caring. He watches assaults, assaults, you name and never intervenes. He thinks the world is lawless and will probably be prosecuted if he does something. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the Taxi race) kicks in, causing the police to call him, to commit a crime, but with his lawyer there to protect him. God bless the America !! <br /> <br /> Once again, it could have been funny, the performances were intentionally extravagant, but nothing good, energy. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed to have their names in this trap. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was taken as well as the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostage crisis. If I had participated in this film, I would like my name to be removed, it is horrible. So again, that's why I watched it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this crap is that Dr. John did the movie soundtrack (repeating "Going to the Movies" several times) and the movie is not. much more than an hour and a half. Show this in film lessons with the title "what you should never do in the movies". This script should have been left on the shelf because yes, it's so bad.
