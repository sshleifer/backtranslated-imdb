(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or CRY OF DEMON) Spoiler This was a drive-in feature, co-billed with VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production, where a number of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen riding, riding with his 'man-eating' dog behind him. <br /> <br /> The people of the city already suspect that he is the only one behind everything and wants his castle to be burned down. The murders began for the first time when Conde Yanos' eldest brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was terribly burned and killed in a laboratory accident. <br /> <br /> Then a Ivanna woman (Erna Schuer) whom Igor hired before dying him in his experiments shows up. Yanos agrees to hire her instead of her brother and together they seek formulas for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred corpse back to life. <br /> <br /> But of course Igor is still alive (though terribly burned), chasing and killing the women of the village. We see his grilled face appear at various points in the movie, so we know he's still alive, making the whole thing seem a bit too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor finds another fiery side as he enters the scene. a fight with Yanos over Ivanna, with the lighted candles falling on the same bed Igor encounters, finding yet another end burned. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source. and it looks quite grainy and bad. In addition to an even more complicated trailer, there are no other extras included. Although it has a nice and scary Spanish castle and good atmospheres, I found this to be quite boring and predictable, without excitement or mystery, whatever. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
