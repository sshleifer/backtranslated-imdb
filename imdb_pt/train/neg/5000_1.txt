This is probably the worst excuse for television programming, since, oh, I do not know, WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW? NOTHING happened in this ridiculous "series." Even being mostly filmed by Britney and Kevin, you do not get good details in your personal lives. Most of the time it's just idiotic and playful talk and acting like white trash. Look, I love Britney's song as much as the next, but this show is just the neat fill for a nation so addicted to Britney that they would watch her cut her toenails (yes, that could be a real episode). Thank God these two separated, because they were painfully annoyed together. This show is toxic!
