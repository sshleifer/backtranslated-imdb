Who were they kidding? There was so much in this movie that it was hard to digest. Since when Arjun (Ajay Devgan) inadvertently wants the death of his father when he arrives in London with his uncle (played by Om Puri), only to leave him minutes later. The only problem with this theory is that anyone who has ever been to London Heathrow knows that such a party would be impossible to realize and especially not by an Indian. But the problems of the movie do not stop there, there is the question of the two main tracks (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) passing as rock stars on the verge of reaching their dreams. I mean, yes, we saw the success come to Susan Boyle (a woman in the United Kingdom who achieved her dreams after 50), but this was a rare case. It was very difficult for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the cast of Salman and Ajay was just ill-conceived. They would never release Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles, so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan (men over 40) around desperately trying to grab their 20s? Let's not even talk about the most self-conscious actress on the screen today, Asin. This is her second film (which I've seen) and she's just an hopeless actress, so conscious of her appearance that she only cares about looking good and voguing to the camera rather than giving a good acting performance. It's hard to believe she refused all other roles in the movies to star in this cuteness and then be so cute as an actress, nothing to write about. And to complete, the film dragged on. There's nothing special about it, believe me, you'll predict every clich√© thing going to happen in it.
