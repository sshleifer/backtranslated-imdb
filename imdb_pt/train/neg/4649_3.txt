The 1957 (yes, that's the correct date) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; It has to be a hit comedy, right? It's awful. It's a gag movie: watching people get shocked at the sight of a small alligator. The song is released inappropriately and forgotten. Jeannie Carson is a competent dancer and singer. But what was she doing in that movie? Diana Dors is here too, offering daring shots to use in the previews. Her acting level is not bad, but she's in the movie to provide someone she likes. Well, we need to do something other than moan during this movie. The movie is now being sold on VHS by people on e-Bay. Save yourself the expense and the loss of time. A comedy without laughing. A musical without memorable music or dance.
