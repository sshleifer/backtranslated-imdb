Wow, that was a really bad movie ... as we read in other reviews, this movie has no plot, no character development, they possibly had some kind of script, but it's hard to say based on the actual end result. <br /> <br /> The editing of this movie was really nonexistent, it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to help the viewer to determine what is really going on. <br /> <br /> In all of this it is simply a low-budget zombie movie that has not been thought of, has bad acting, bad dialogue, all bad. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think this must be where they spent the money they had to try to justify doing it. <br /> <br /> Unless you're (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie movies you can find, do not watch it. Period.
