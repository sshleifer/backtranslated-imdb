Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a bland movie. Why did I watch movies like that when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another. I do not know, I think I needed a hobby during adolescence. A marginalized adolescent (Rainbow Harvest) seeks solace in an old mirror. Soon she learns about the horrible power that this ancient mirror has and uses it to attack those who deceived her. Films like these, the donor power has an unpleasant side effect. This changes it in and out whether she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> A mess of a movie that for some reason was restored in d.v.d. a few years ago. I do not know why. They should have left it on the shelf and collect dust. People love this enemy movie for some reason. If you want, I'd like to know why. Until then, I do not like this movie and I have no reason to watch it again. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
