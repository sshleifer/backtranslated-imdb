I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it. My expectations for the movie were going up and down since I heard it being done. Some days I would see something spectacular and in a few days I would be disappointed. Still being the kind of fan I am, I had high hopes for this movie, but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I love the Richard Donner movies, I did not like their sometimes extravagant nature or the changes they made to Superman's character and his powers. <br /> <br /> Singer however chose to take the worst elements of Donner's films and put them in his version. <br /> <br /> While his Lex Luthor is a little darker, he is still nothing more than a shyster, a con man and a common criminal. He is no smarter than when Gene Hackman played him. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well, but ends up being a victim of shoddy texts and banal dialogues. His henchmen are more two-dimensional than the comic book henchmen. Most of them literally have no dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** CHILDREN AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Mrs. Tesmacher. She seems to be as bad and cold as Lex Luthor, but she proves to be just a subaltern that melts after seeing Superman in trouble and predictably betrays Luthor. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the movie was Frank Langella as Perry White. I was not a big fan of the exaggerated Perry White in Donner's films, but at least he had a soul. He was, after all, said and done, a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story. Langella's Perry White is just a corporate puppet. He wants everyone to focus on Superman stories because they sell newspapers, although all the other newspapers are doing the same thing. He does not care about the real stories, the real mysteries like the black out and what Lex Luthor is up to now that he's out of prison. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that he is annoying! Some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an underlying current that lets you know that the waters are still deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He is fine, but again there is not a single memorable line throughout the film. It's not the actor's fault. His movements are clearly meant to look graceful, as even the slightest movement of his fingers affects the way he flies. But it still seems choreographed and artificial. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, while poorly written, was surprisingly well played by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, once again, for a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer, she is as eloquent as any teenager in Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was my favorite actor throughout the film, mainly because he looks more Superman than even Routh. Without any superpowers, he manages to discover Lois Lane's message, flies to the scene, embarks on Luthor's yacht and rescues Lois and his son. <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the movie is when they are all pantry stuck while it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking. You see them slowly being immersed in the water. You know Superman will appear at the last moment to rescue them, but still you can not help but feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the plot is very random. Unlike Singer said, this is not a movie about a returning superhero and trying to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns, the world welcomes him with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him back. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him a chance to hit the board with the steel man. <br /> <br /> Superman is shown to be probably one of the most idiotic heroes in the universe. A large piece of green meteorite is stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is out of prison, he now has knowledge about Superman's powers and weaknesses, yet he can not connect the dots enough to know what Luthor would be wearing kryptonite against it. <br /> <br /> According to the film, the only good thing for Superman is lifting really heavy things. The action sequences are incredibly predictable.
