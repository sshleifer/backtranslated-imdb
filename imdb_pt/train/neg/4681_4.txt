We laughed our heads. This screenplay is so incredible that you either go to CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father was sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie. During his experience as an officer, he already stated the command on the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / day and (sorry) s ** t on his desk. Of course this was not on a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing in any ship, nuclear or not. Giving a drill at the time is just a Hollywood script. When a captain is arrested, he is arrested, you take all the keys and open the safe where the guns are guarded. This is stored in a few minutes in a well protected room. He CAN NOT escape, it's like in prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room. This is not done, ever. My dad cleaned up all the mess the dog did wherever he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington do the three stars that this movie is credited for, all the rest is bullshit t. <br /> <br /> When we know that 23 people were still alive in Koersk, this movie takes on an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rental: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
