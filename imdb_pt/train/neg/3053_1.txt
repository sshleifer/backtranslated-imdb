Wow. Who said Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anyone? This steaming pile of donkey droppings is a perfect case; makes "The Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes the worst flashbacks of Keith Richards look like my first nightly broadcast. I had nightmares, you know, waking up and sweating bullets, that will never get close to the visceral terror that Santa has unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my own being. However, I can think of some parts in which this film can really go over the top. Also, if you're looking for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on VHS tape, look no further. Do not check out this movie, as I was notified, the MST3K version is now available. Move on Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
