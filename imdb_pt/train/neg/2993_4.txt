I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a good horror movie. When the body of a terrorist, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the US military, the corpse is then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. Soon, infected sites become flesh-hungry zombies, and a group of licensed soldiers need to join a group of tourists and lodge in an abandoned hotel as they try to fight the aggressive undead. I did not find this movie as good as the original movie, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still an OK horror movie with some good action. I do not think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
