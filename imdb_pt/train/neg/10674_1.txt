This ranks as one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Apart from Cuba and Angie, the acting is really embarrassing. Was not Archer a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent, but completely implausible. The makeup is so bad it is worth mentioning. I mean, who thinks of makeup in a contemporary feature film? Someone should tell the makeup artist and PDO that you should not really see. The ending is a huge disappointment - along the lines of "and then they realized it was all a dream" <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or your money. You're better off just staring into space for 2 hours.
