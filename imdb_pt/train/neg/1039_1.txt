This "movie" is one of the most terrible things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent mix. <br /> <br /> Shaking the camera and having your actors Embracing frowns does not count as "direction" that this movie needed in bulk. Not that the writing was so wonderful, but we get a lot of completely artificial characters directed in the most artificial way (the "pseudo-documentary style" valued by those who do not know how to direct). > This film gives the impression that it was cynically made to appeal to critics who know nothing about the cinema (which is most of them). <br /> <br /> Simply terrible. It says a lot about Sundance and what became Victor Vargas was shown there.
