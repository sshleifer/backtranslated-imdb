When I rented "Unhinged", I was expecting a bloody movie. The box even claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical version (now I have serious doubts about this being released in the theater). After finishing the film, I wondered how he could even get a video release. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: a group of three young women on a car trip crashes their car into a tree. These women can somehow get to a mansion, which contains an extremely sexist woman. Beyond this point, the film is composed mostly of useless scenes that are meant to make the film long enough for the release. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie horrible is acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, seems to be reading her talk of tips. The others acting are bad, but not as bad as hers. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique. Many photos are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. This gets very annoying as the movie progresses. On top of all this, there is very little blood, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this. My Review: 1 of 10
