I like to keep my comments short and simple, but that sums it up very well. You can not win the two originals for a number of reasons, one of which including Chris Columbous's directing talent. <br /> <br /> This film had a terrible direction covered by an even more terrible performance. I can not even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Painful to sit and watch. The plot was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists in a meticulous search to retrieve it. Awful, rent one from the original trailer and enjoy! <br /> <br /> The film was not even defined during Christmas as the original. Home Alone has been transformed from an excellent family Christmas comedy movie to a joke with no morals or plot!
