Pet Sematary, despite a good horror film from the 80s, with a good director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian film ZEDER by Pupi Avati. Of course Stephen King copied almost every idea of ​​this director (the film Zeder was done before the King wrote the book) <br /> <br /> The cat, the floor, everything was copied, this is a case of plagiarism , but Stephen Kind being a famous American writer, it's totally normal for him to get away with it, it's obviously due to the huge difference between this type of Italian films with no budget (and in part, it's crap itself ...) but the original idea, I repeat, is the Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
