A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is flatter than a stretch of the interstate highway in western Texas. And like the desert landscape, there is not much to distinguish, not even the fact that a prisoner is being transported by two naval escorts this time. No one in the cast goes very well; with this lame script that is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not give much room for this if he writes a memoir, I do not think.
