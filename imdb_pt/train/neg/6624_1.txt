This movie was absolutely ... ugh I can not find the word oh, wait ... crap! I mean, when it all started, I was like, that sounds good and then it was so annoying. I almost slept and had nothing to do with the fact that I caught a late show because it was total dirt. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best, but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original Sholay I mean what he was thinking of doing a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the prizes next year, how did he do to Black? Ajay and that other guy were good, especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at. What was Amitabh doing? He's destroying his own dignity by making all these movies stupid. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this I want to say he has managed to gather some of his money and go as far from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and I am saying that he has already passed the half of the way. I mean, all of this is really good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan, who is getting a good name now because of Amitabh's recent downfall. I never really liked him because he thinks he's God and I just knew Abhishek would be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save 17.75 pounds and spend it on something good, watch Heyy Babyy because it's the funniest movie of all time and it's number one on the charts!
