I went to China in this movie. I chose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was modeling at the time in Italy and they could not pronounce my real name correctly, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani, since it was similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I had never acted before (and it shows), but it was a lot of fun to shoot. They gave me "acting lessons" every morning (which obviously were not helpful). They dubbed my voice (thank God). <br /> <br /> David and Peter were a blast on set, full of good humor and jokes. This movie was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax cut under insider trading. <br /> <br /> I give a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had to "act" on it.
