A terrible movie that should be independent. He needed some dependence on something. <br /> <br /> This totally miserable movie deals with the interactions between the Irish. They were trying to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, this movie has completely collapsed. <br /> <br /> There's a lot going on here, culminated by a running bitch and throwing stones at buses and cars that obviously cause chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is too hectic to work. One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. This causes the ex-sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around with clothes that are not worth believing. The older sister is also bitter, but soon finds romance. <br /> <br /> So, we have 3 losers who buy masks to rob a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes awry, but there seems to be no punishment for the bad guys. Perhaps, the punishment should have been of the writers for not creating a cohesive film.
