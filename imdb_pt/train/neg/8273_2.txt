Lots of promise and nothing more. A cast of stars certainly by HK standards, but man, man, this is a stink. No history? Okay, the action will make up for it like most of HK's action movies. What? Is the action terrible, tacky and sparse? The Dragon Dynasty's releases up to this point are generally excellent and generally considered classic in Asian cinema. This is a rust. They have managed to dispute two actors of Infernal Affairs, but they can not give life to a disjointed script. There are dialogue scenes where two or three lines are spoken with a cut between them and no continuity in what the characters are saying. You almost feel like each one of them is giving a monologue and ignoring the other characters. Michael Biehn is made of wood, really? Sammo Hung uses a stunt? No way. Yes way. To stay away.
