I am sure that people who have seen this change out of Britain this film will be a fun watch but for someone from the UK it is painful in their mistakes. <br /> <br /> Early in the movie Elijah Wood gets out of a tube at the bank station, which has been destroyed. He tells his sister that he is meeting, "What happened here" and she replies "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in town ... they are part of the city, they do not have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight other fans, the last place in the world would be Bank Station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are several other similar mistakes, but the biggest flaw for me is the actor who plays the lead hooligan. He clearly decided that it was not worth trying to speak with an East End accent and opted for a mock-ney-style Dick Van Dyke that made my ears bleed. It was accentuated by the fact that the rest of his gang spoke the way you would expect West Ham fans to talk. This mistake made him unbelievable on paper and really spoiled the movie.
