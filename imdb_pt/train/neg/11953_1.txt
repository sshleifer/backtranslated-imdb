Do you know those movies that you held in the movies? You're stuck there in the best place in the house, in the middle of the queue in your own special place that you traded three times before you get the right place - and after about 13 hours you're still stuck there, uncomfortable and scratching, thinking " When the F *** is this movie that will end? " (You know the feeling - think of A.I. and The Village). <br /> <br /> Well, Visitor Q offers a strange variant of that feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when things would start! It's endless! So, "Arty" hurts. This is Miike Takashi's first movie I watched. Apparently, he makes dozens of movies, and if they're all pretentious like that, I suspect he'll be the last. <br /> <br /> I'm not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is up there among the top 10 directors for me, but the Q Visitor is cut rate, cheap and nasty pretentious w @ nk. <br /> <br /> As you may have worked so far - I hated it.
