At the end of this thriller, Ally Sheedy's wacky image is used creatively to create more of an astonishing image. She convinces one that if a nasty Bette Davis-type role came up, she could take it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can not find many other reasons to see this. If you've ever wondered what Sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?), So here's your answer. Besides, Sally Kirkland's crazy, sex-starved woman is really tiring, and even if you like that sort of thing more than I do, you'll have to admit that tension sinks badly into those scenes. Savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally unpleasant, but at least it's a small role. Of the main actors, Nicholas Walker shows no sympathy for Paul Keller's situation and his performance is of wood. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level goes up a bit. Sheedy's meticulous and understated performance (though it seems to be on autopilot) is admirable in itself, but out of context with the rest. The sets are monotonous, the camera work indistinguishable.
