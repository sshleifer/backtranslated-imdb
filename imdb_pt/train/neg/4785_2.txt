So much is wrong with this wet and abysmal tits from a movie that it's hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First, it's a frighteningly scary movie, even by American standards. The dialogue is clich√©, the characters are two-dimensional, writing is discouraged, and the little story that exists is neither coherent nor remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> We find the following stereotypes in order: Guy (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie does not tell us) with a brave heart, the Young Hero (who does nothing heroic), Brave Little Kid with a homicidal footprint of a mile wide) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with more muscles than brains). These guys start a fight with the Spooky Grim Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of little metal orbits surrounding menacing people. Given the chance, they perform improvised brain surgeries on those who do not have the mental acuity to lower when they reach them. Booh! In fact, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but again, it may be a misleading specter) who seems willing to help our brave contactors recover their kidnapped young friend. <br /> <br /> There is no background for the characters or even an introduction to any of the characters. It starts with some sort of recap from the end of the previous movie, but that does not explain much. If you saw the first two movies, fine. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they are related, why they are not at school or at work, or why you should care if they live or die. Consequently, you do not. The single point of interest becomes any splatter effect. And there is not enough to keep you awake. Of interest / fun are the three Raider Punks, as stupid as evil, who threaten Our Heroes. But they do not get much time on the screen. They leave almost immediately. Then they are buried (why someone should take the time is beyond me) then they appear again as Evil Raider Punk Zombies. Just to get fired again, literally in a minute. The rest of the film seems to consist mainly of Caspar, the Friendly Ghost, appearing and disappearing, driving around looking for places, and Balding, the Loser, trying to make some sound. Bad Black Bitch Booty, using pickup lines that would embarrass a mentally retarded teenager. No data there; not even some free sex could have saved this movie, so it's good that there are never any. <br /> <br /> The villain in the head, called the Tall Man, can not scare anyone over 3; howling "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Because he, with his incredible telekinetic powers and his strange strength in the upper body, does not simply crush our heroes as insects is not explained. Instead, he delegates the work to his inept laggards, who can never kill anyone before being shot in hell. <br /> <br /> People who like masterpieces like "Friday, 13th Part XXXXVIII: Jason Goes to College" find some entertainment. The rest of us, who have developed pubic hair, will be bored of our skulls.
