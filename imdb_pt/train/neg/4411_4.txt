Michael Rooker is a decent actor but he has no way to be the protagonist except in a low budget film. He does not really have much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has a lot more presence on the screen and unfortunately he is not really the main character. Most of the screen time goes to the brick-faced Rooker. Danielle Harris (from Halloween movies 4 and 5) plays her daughter, and she's cute and funny, but she's written as not being very smart and one of her dumb mistakes gets one of the dead main characters. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are here in interesting roles. Just watching what happens to these characters is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays Consigliare for the local mafia godfather, and it's hard to say whether or not he's working on the film as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It seems to be in all low cost direct action movies for video. Thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. Seeing so many comedians and comedic actors in this movie made it look like a parody. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? It's hard to say in some points. There is certainly very little Yakuza stock. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast of Thugs and Goons is menacing and well launched. Some of these types of movies have bandits who seem to work at the local Comic Book Store or as Piggly-Wiggly kids. Overall, this movie is very patchy. At times, it looks like a comedy or a parody. So at other points, it works like a good action movie. Then he spits to the end. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi this movie would rate a Zero in my humble opinion.
