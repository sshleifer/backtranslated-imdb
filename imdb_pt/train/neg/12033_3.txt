Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. The new family moves in, quote from overdubs, mediocre acting, green jelly salad with chopped carrots, and all the other "Mormon jokes" known to man. Anyone outside of Mormon culture will have a hard time putting up with this movie. Anyone within the Mormon culture is going to have a little fun with a laugh here and there. You'll be much better off watching the other Hess movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) than trying to get through this movie. The acting is mediocre. Jared Hess had in his hands a lot more quality films like "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend the two films on that moan.
