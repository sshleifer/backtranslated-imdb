I mean, really, how could Charles Band, the head of the Full Moon, leave a stinking ball like DEMONICA's? I mean I should never have the green light to start. The story is repetitive, the characters are weak at best, there's no real story about Tyranus, so he's a bad guy. So the writer or director goes out in search of a bad ending. That's a really bad ending, Demonicus goes up. The last survivor escapes from a mortal cave, so an image of Chimera comes to life, at a low cost that I could add and pursue. Then as she is walking home wing FUNHOUSE. A statue that has been destroyed for centuries reappears for no reason but to collapse upon it. I mean, that does not make sense. What the hell was Charles thinking of allowing this pile of vomit to be made, with four different movie companies desperate for movies? They could have asked me, I had better ideas than DEMONICUS. THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
