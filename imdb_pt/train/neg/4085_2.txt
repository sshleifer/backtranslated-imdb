"Sir" John Gielgud must have become senile to star in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies, I suppose, considered "art", but do not be fooled ..... it's crap. Stick to "art" that you can admire in a picture, because films labeled as such are usually unintelligible fakes like that. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Giegud recites Shakespeare's "The Tempest," while the cameras distance to naked people. one of them a little boy peeing in a pool. Wow, that's a heady thing and a real "art", is not it? This is just an example. Most of the story makes no sense, it is impossible to follow, and therefore it is a criticism that liberals are afraid to say they do not "understand", so they give high marks to save their false egos. Do you want Shakespeare? Read your books.
