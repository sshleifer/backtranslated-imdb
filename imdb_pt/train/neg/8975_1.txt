... said a couple leaving the movies as soon as I was coming in to watch this. Hmm, not a good sign, but who knows? Different traits for different people, after all. Well no. They were being kind. Godard has released work that is passionate (Despise), entertaining (Band of Outsiders), sometimes both (My Life to Live). This is just a dull intellectualism, which irritates the nerves quickly. During my presentation, literally half the audience had left by the end of the film. If I had been so wise.
