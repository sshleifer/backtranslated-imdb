This juvenile, bland flick is strictly for teenagers in bodies of old, desperate to revive their teenage years with hormonal problems. As ? By burning the gas and equating a car (or plane) fast and reckless to freedom. The plot borrows heavily from the Mister Rogers neighborhood (if run by an oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if it was heavily sedated and did not have a clear sense of style. <br /> Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this movie is set in a post-gas crisis world in which an all-powerful government does not want you (* ahem *) to drive your car and burn gas. of the current Enron-and-Bush government, which seizes oil and pushes the SUV. <br /> <br /> This juxtaposition only makes the movie ridiculous.But wait ... there is more.Although the film is set in the future, we are not shown any sign of future technology, other than returning to bikes, golf carts and horses.You will believe that the future looks ... just like today.the same clothes, the same suburban houses, the same green lawns of today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions for to turn energy. <br /> <br /> The acting is flat and tasteless. Even scenes that might have been brave or moving, friend-movie, honor, romance, horror ... all fall more than a paper doll under a briefcase. <br /> <br /> Continuity of failure - the jet flown by Burgess Meredith's character changes color and configuration from moment to moment, as filmmakers insult our intelligence with incomparable images. <br /> <br /> The plot is as idiotic and as exciting as a Duke of Hazzard. <br /> <br /> Even fans of plastic and SF movies should avoid this movie as an old animal unless you like to challenge the executives at Exxon who try to make a film as empty as the gas tank of the hero.
