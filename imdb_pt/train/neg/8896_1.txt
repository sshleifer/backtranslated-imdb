I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (September 12, 2009). I'm 61 and I've been watching movies for as long as I remember. I can honestly say that Brigadoon is alone as by far the worst movie I have ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local children's club would have produced better sets. The characters were so wooden that they probably contracted the rotten tears of the customers who had the misfortune to watch them. It is to be hoped that the stars of this film have been thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment that they must have suffered when seeing this film. The owners of this gut must provide a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film.
