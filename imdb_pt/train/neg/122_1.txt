I would put this at the top of my list of movies in the unusable rubbish category! There are movies that are bad, but the worst are those that are unattainable, but you must like them because they are good for you! The sex sequences, so shocking in their day, could not even rouse a rabbit. The so-called controversial politics is strictly high school in the second year of amateur Marxism. The film is self-consciously artistic in the worst sense of the term. The photograph is grainy black and white. Some scenes are blurred or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call it art? <br /> <br />
