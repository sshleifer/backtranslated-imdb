I could not believe how horrible this movie was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but I thought, "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching." I'm corrected. Everyone involved should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> I know that there are not many important roles for women of a certain age, but the script for it was so inept, clich√© and disconcerting that I'm surprised that it ever got underway or that Mrs. Keaton thought he could make a silk purse out of the nut's ear. None of the characters had an ounce of credibility and it was unbelievably unpleasant. The acting looked like exercise in a class BEGINNING - I stared in horror with my mouth open for most of that thought "What were they thinking?" Very, very sad that you have come to this. Do not waste your time.
