This is the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It barely made sense. It was nothing scary (unless you feel scared like loud noises and screaming?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar needs to stop with those few horror films. I think everyone else in the movies agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credits rolled. In my list of the worst movies of all time, this is how it happens: <br /> <br /> 1. The Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> /> The reason I did Silent Hill 3 is because it showed some scary scenes, but the rest was absolute cr4p. Even with the cabin fever, it did not make sense, but the return headed the list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever together
