Now I recently had the pleasure of watching the hilarious comedy Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, laughed until it just hurt the kind of movies. So naturally, I wanted to see the sequel, hoping she'd have the same laughs, but instead, Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is made by the American Pie generation, where it's in bad taste and defeats the purpose of the first movie. Yes, the first movie has nudity, but it does not appear in every scene. Also the plot is exactly the same from the first, not always a complaint with me, but this could have been a bit more original. The only thing is that I'm happy that at least there are no original actors from the original appearing in this movie because it would have been extravagant or really silly. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged, after only two months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a wealthy family, but they are very happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd is afraid that Ron will accept his work. So they go out on a weekend for a bachelor party in Miami and Todd will make sure he's going to put Ron in a photo that will make Melinda change her mind about the wedding. Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation has a few laughs here and there, but most of all it fails to deliver what the first movie did. These guys, Ron's friends, were more obnoxious than nice, except for Seth, he was kind of funny. The only friendly characters other than Seth are Ron and Melinda, everyone pretty much gets on their nerves. Do you want to watch this movie? Just watch Girls Gone Wild, it's the same thing that does not try to pretend it's a movie. Stick with the original bachelor party, this is the movie that will make you cry with laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
