Expectations were a bit high for me when I went to watch this movie, after all I thought Steve Carell could not do anything wrong with great movies like Anchor, 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, was I wrong? <br /> <br /> I'll start with what's right with this movie: at certain points, Steve Carell may be Steve Carell. There are a handful of moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it's almost entirely for him to have room to maneuver to do his thing. He's an unquestionably talented individual, and it's a shame he signed what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total train disaster. <br /> <br /> With that out of the way, I'll discuss What was horribly wrong? <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls who is being considered for a column of nationally syndicated boards. He prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his relatives meet for some time with each other. <br /> <br /> The family is at the top of the list of things that make this a horrible movie. No family behaves like this. It's almost as if they've been transported from Pleasantville or Leave it to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we are seven years old. It reaches the point where they become unpleasant and simply frustrating. Soccer touch, crossword puzzles, family bowling, and talent shows ARE NOT COMPLETE WITH REAL PEOPLE. It's almost sick. <br /> <br /> Another major flaw is the woman Carell should be falling in love with. Watching her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a spill victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine is supposed to be original and original in this woman is a little retarded. <br /> <br /> It makes me think that this movie is happening on another planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw. After thinking more, I do not think it was much.
