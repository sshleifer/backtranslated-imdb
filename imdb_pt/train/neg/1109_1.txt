This is almost certainly the worst west I have ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common for Western movies and martial arts - the hero discovers that family / friends have been murdered, so the hero decides to take revenge, spoils the ineffective cop, rescues the kidnapped love maiden and kills the expert. arch-enemy in a brutal duel. This formula has been successful successfully - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most suffering execution you've ever seen. The script is atrociously simplistic and insulting; It seems that a schoolboy wrote the dialogue because lack depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; sometimes it seems nicknamed. Cinematography is lame and sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is regrettable; Of course, some of the artists could blame the script, but others can not use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert again in a paper of speech; every time he says a line that should be angry or evil, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he sounds like a child trying to act like a male. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his failures (if you dare to watch this movie): He wears these new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a cowboy who works hard, down and dirty. . If you like intimate cinematic movies that are only meant to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get that, but if you have more than two neurons, look at something else.
