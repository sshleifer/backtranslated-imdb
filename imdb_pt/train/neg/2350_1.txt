This show was ridiculously bad. The writing sucked, the dialogue box was sucked. The guy who played Craig could not get out of a paper bag. Being that it was Thursday night, this was definitely great to see with a few beers. Cool music, poor acting, poor writing, all came together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was an unintentional drama / comedy. I do not care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, since they could not reveal who the victim was, they had to write the dialogue around her, which was terrible. I mean, the compliment to the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that occurred in the present were totally horrible. <br /> <br /> So let's review. All happening in the present time sucked. The flashback scenes, just the writing, the dialogue and the acting of Craig are a drug. The music ruled though.
