With 30 seconds of opening, I had the feeling that this would be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad it was. So the actor who plays the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decided that to survive this movie we will have to turn the volume down, create our own dialogue and double the speed of the DVD. But that did not help. About half, we hung up. Now, I've been through some really bad movies, both with and without the helper of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are only a few movies that I doubt even the Bots can save. Most of the movie that bothered me most was that people hypnotized into believing that zombies had rotten green skin. I think they were all hypnotized into death, then hypnotized into rotting. Stick to true cult classics from B movies like "Plan Nine From Outer Space".
