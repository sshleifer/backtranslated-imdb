If John Waters had written and directed "House of 1000 Corpses" after being repeatedly hit by the head with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "The Blood Shed." It's slightly fun for the first half hour, but then it turns into a kind of constant screaming of constant screams and people doing things to the genitals with knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad at everything he's doing in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that most viewers will not take long to forget it.
