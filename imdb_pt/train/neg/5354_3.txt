Absence of a good trait, absence of decent ACTING, absence of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, absence of special effects of decent appearance ... need to continue? Comment, it may contain SPOILERS. The actors seem to be READING their speeches, and not very well at it. Most of the "actors" were acting like they were in a SECOND DEGREE game. The story seems to have been written by one of the second grade students mentioned above ... it's not really that complicated ... it's so SIMPLE and MUTE, that a person thinks he must be missing something, so he thinks it's complicated. No, it's EXACTLY SIMPLE as you think it is. I understood the "movie", that's how I know it's stunk! Most of the movie only had people sitting around talking (reading their lines), TRYING to look sinister. The narrator was annoying. The "special effects" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... just not in this movie ... you can tell they were not being paid or were not being paid much because neither their heart nor theirs talents were in it. I love Tony Todd ... however, it was only fitting in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was only there for about two minutes (seriously)! I would suggest advancing the DVD to Tony Todd's two-minute segment. If I had gone to the theater and paid more than a DOLLAR to see this "movie", I would have been caught and required my money back. I hope people who have done this do better next time.
