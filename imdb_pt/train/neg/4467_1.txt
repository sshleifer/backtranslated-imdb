<br /> <br /> I'm not sure what category a movie fits into, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was quite interesting, but rather slow. I was especially disappointed with the ending. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why on earth she runs to her uncle's house (?) Without even calling the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what is happening at that moment, besides having a videotape as proof. Instead, she runs up there and begins to go crazy and say, "I know everything, I have proof! You did not expect proof, did you?" Then she is surprised when her uncle gets up and starts walking to her as if he would hurt her. Well DUH! Of course he will hurt you, you just tell him that he knows everything and has proof to expose everything. What a stupid end.
