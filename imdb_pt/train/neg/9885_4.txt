He only gets third place (behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but this was effectively the first role of David Niven and he is charmingly foolish as Bertie Wooster, master of P. Wodehouse, master (only in name) of Jeeves, the most imperturbable of jacks. As an adaptation, it is more like a watery step than a true Wodehousian ride. And that's too bad, since the interaction between Treacher and Niven is not far from the truth. Unfortunately, the mysterious tropes of the movie 'B' and forced comedy become tiresome even in a brief 57 minutes. The continuation of next year (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more imprecise, with no Bertie in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) Forced to play games.
