As a Turk now living in Sweden, I must confess that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most if I never understood. I think actors in Scandinavia work better in Hollywood. Last week I watched a movie called "The Polish Wedding" along with a Polish friend of mine, and we both said it was the worst movie we watched. Unfortunately I was wrong this movie "House of Angels" is even worse. None of the actors can act, absolutely not the female star named Helen Bergstrom. The plot is so silly that no one can believe. I think the whole thing is a mess from the beginning. a lot of bad acting except for Selldal and Wollter. Ahmed Sellam
