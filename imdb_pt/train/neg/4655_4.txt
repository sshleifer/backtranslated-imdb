I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The opening moments, with a naked woman sprawled out and a painter, Diana, about to paint her and then suck her blood to drain so she can use it for her art, give the impression that this could be an art breathtaking. vampire movie It turns out that this initial impression is false. Oh, Troma, the brand of some kind of quality lack: sometimes they offer something that is rubbish, but it is funny and with at least some competence for the art of junk food (or sometimes not). Is this a case in which it is not even a lot of fun to watch, since his attempts at humor (ie the protagonist's father is an old Vaudevillian who makes impressions of Jimmy Durante?) Are weak at best, and any laughter does not is undermined by Sergio Lapel. And it's not without him trying, oh Lord. He tries a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for the lights, of course, but the way they're used in the movie made me, a former film director and aspiring director, berate me in my place: if I saw this in a movie theater , would have to blind my eyes in many cases, and would like to know if your DP really understood or not the basic configuration of 3-point lighting. Meanwhile, along with a very dull sound design (or just a bunch of random buzz like in the art gallery scene), should not be something that draws attention during a Troma release, it should be something * basic * that a filmmaker can attack even if the script is not very funny or scary (and it's not) or if Lapel does a weird mix of songs put in bizarre moments. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie at all, and maybe if you're an inveterate vampire (or just a vampire period) it might have some appeal as a cheap alternative to Near Dark, or as a slight improvement over, for example, Blood Freak of 1972. You have better ways to waste your time overall.
