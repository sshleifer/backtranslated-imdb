really horrible ... main actor did everything right ... the movie, plot, etc., was completely crap and inaccurate, may well have been a continuation to ... anything that had little or no relevance to Carlitos Way. .. and it should be avoided like the plague by all Carlito fans ... without mention of Gail, in fact, he ends up with some other bird, no mention of Klienfelt, no mention of how he got caught, no mention of how He ended up in jail. .. they tried to do it like the original with flash backs at the beginning ... but to be honest when evaluating it I was looking for a zero mark ... unfortunately I had to rate it higher ... It's a terrible attempt to profit from what was one of the best movies of the 90s ... overall it was about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted ... for all the "action" on it, it was really boring, slow and predictable ... again for any fan of Carltio's Way to avoid this fiasco ...
