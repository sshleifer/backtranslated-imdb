I really wanted to like this movie and I watched it all the way thinking I had to get better. Do not get me wrong, it's not the worst movie of all time, but it never lives up to its potential. The premise is good, the cast is great (I was especially excited to witness the return of David Naughton) and, God loves them, you can tell everyone who tried their best. He falls short again and again. "Brutal Massacre" should serve as a constant reminder to filmmakers that only Christopher Guest can make Christopher Guest movies and despite the fact that it makes it look easy, you should probably forget to try to do the same. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic at this and should be seen more often ... they are the reason why it gets 4 stars from me. If you're going to have the "Spinal Tap" horror, I suspect you might want the guy who did "Spinal Tap" to helm ... just think aloud there.
