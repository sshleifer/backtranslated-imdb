There is so little here in Anne Rice's fantastic book that what is here does not make sense. Some of the characters - intense and surprising characters - do not get on the screen, and those who do are watered down to the point where there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the case between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear, since her story was never explained? Where is Marie's rape and redemption, whose major attribute (and fall) is that she can go white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end with the beating of Marcel in the hands of his father? We have learned nothing from Aglae beyond that she is a bitch who hates her husband; Why is there no backstory explaining this hatred? <br /> <br /> As for the performances, there is not one that is better than mediocre, although this is due to the poor script. Best of all is the actor playing Richard - but Richard is not on screen enough to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, although, once again, the actress has nothing to do with how little she's given to work. <br /> <br /> In short, this is simply terrible. I thought it would be impossible for any Anne Rice movie turned movie to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes this mess seem like a decisive hit. How is Rice so slutty that she's going to let her best work become such garbage on the screen?
