I could not believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television. It starts very slowly, the backgrounds of the Nuremberg trials become clear step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but suddenly, in the last minutes of the first part of the series, the public can see more Shocking and horrible images that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is important for people to see these images (although I absolutely disagree with people stating that there is no minimum age for children to be exposed to this type of material), but in this film it was completely ridiculous. It was purely to enhance the impact of a common TV series. It was made to shock the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move us through well-made scenes, inspiring dialogues or interesting points of view, the public is being tortured with horrible images of skin-and-bone camp prisoners. It shows no respect for the victims of the holocaust. <br /> <br /> I'm very angry.
