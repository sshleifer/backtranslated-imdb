I just emailed a friend who is in film school about this movie. Something to avoid when making a movie - characters chattering absurd, exaggerated and cursed monologues on screen that are ultimately trivial and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal dams are so exaggerated that they really draw attention to the film as a film and effectively counteract that intention. Is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both? <br /> <br /> The protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - voraciously consuming English canonical literature and the Bible while high or hangover and able to produce such deeply sophomoric Soliloquies while intoxicated? And how is a character so unattractive, dirty and verbally harmful that he can lie down with most of the women he meets within minutes of meeting them? (I had to cheer when a girl finally threw him out in spite of his whining and self-pitying joke). The spectator finds pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations. . The impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our brows or right hands in a frightening biblical way, is presented to a character who is so cleverly exposed in his role as guardian of empty space. <br /> <br /> This film is scripted and exaggerated - an infused melodrama of a pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of humanity, of life, etc. It is banal, exaggerated and tedious. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English films available with content similar to this movie. "Nil by Mouth" is an excellent and much more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social environment. Same for "In the War Zone." And while the comparison may not be justified, check out anything from Peter Greenaway, who manipulates dialogue, wit, and absurd characters and situations a lot more.
