I myself am a big fan of low budget 80's horror movies. This is not the worst, but still not spectacular. The plot is decent, but it drags on for a long time. You go through the middle of the movie before even seeing any zombie action. The killings are not very creative and the zombies are not very resourceful. I really think this movie would have been better if they had let the zombies out and just made a Mafia movie. It's watchable, but I feel like this movie stole at least an hour of my life. I will give credit to the film for being original. If you're really into B horror movies it's worth a look, but if you're not, do not bother. But you do not have to believe my word.
