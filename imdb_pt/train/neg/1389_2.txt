I was very disappointed with this movie. Plotwise was weak bordering the fool: Souls that can affect reality the way they do? A seemingly critical mission for the soul hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? And the whole B-story with the "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the station was so horrible that at one point I let out for the television, "Why are you wasting my time on this?" <br /> <br /> Thematically, "River of Souls" did not enter the soul issue in more depth than the original episode "Soul Hunter" did. We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not feel their culture. (Is there any female Soul Hunter?) The acting was fine, given the stuff they had to work on, and the special effects - especially the planetscapes in the first act - were very impressive. But overall, I would say that this is a fault.
