An interesting conceptual vampirism having something to do with a virus (but done several times so far). In general, the film is very long and creeps a little. The issue could have been more rigorous. Sorry to hear about the problem with the credits. Maybe the movie was brought to market. The lighting was very dark in some places. But the worst technical problem is the audio. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many of the interiors have an echo sound to them, which is very disturbing. Either they were not careful in recording or the sound mix could have been better. Too much background noise passed. O should have gotten someone to make sound effects for the martial arts scenes. The tinkling of thumping swords was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in combat scenes, the issue needed to be more rigorous. <br /> <br /> Also the acting was a bit flat. I'm sorry, but when I see the same person writing and starring in a movie, in my experience it's a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort, so I gave it a 4.
