Much the most boring nonsense I've seen in a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance, and the acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, camera angles were used that made me feel bad, incidental music was terrible and drowned the dialogue (maybe not a bad thing at the time), and the images of San Francisco appeared to have been stolen directly from the city's tourism council promotional video. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done. Better lighting next time, please.
