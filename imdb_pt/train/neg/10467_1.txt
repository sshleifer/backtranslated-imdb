If there was ever a call to make a bad movie that reflected how mankind could become stupid, that person would receive the prize. The plot revolves around biblical prophecies found in hidden messages from the scriptures that incite a group of henchmen in search of power to attempt total control of the world. How stupid does this writer really think people really are? <br /> <br /> The performance was poor at best. Casper Van Dien wasted his talent making this movie. The work of Michael York was a fair game for the role, since he was the center of the film and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was revolting and very disturbing. No tender or immature mind should see this movie. This is how a basic plot of good versus evil can go astray. There must be a lot of mental illness floating around in the movie circles, looking for ways to market such junk. There must have been something censored to get a rating for PG-13, but it was still horrible.
