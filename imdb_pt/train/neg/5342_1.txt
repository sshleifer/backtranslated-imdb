Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are at their best here. They deserve the Oscar nominations for their performances. I'm a big fan of the TV show too. Their music is rock and they are all so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU ARE A FAN CLUB DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> The performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible and the jokes are not even performed correctly (I feel sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 passionate S Club fans were not laughing. They thought they could do better. And they did. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "the fat and ugly who started a mosh band" must be thanking his stars for the luck he left when he did it. One of the worst movies ever made. CAUTION WITH THIS MOVIE! DO NOT GO AND SEE! You will not laugh! YOU WILL CRY! 0/10 RJT
