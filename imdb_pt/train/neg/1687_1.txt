If you go see this movie, you will hold a grudge against the cinema, the director, the producer, the actors and the person who told you to go and see! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and face on this poor excuse of a movie. It may have been more frightening if the Japanese actors had just finished speaking Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to boo when the movie ended ... a real disappointment after all the hype on TV and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle did not really have to act to make this movie ... she just practiced her frowning skills. Do not waste time or money on this movie.
