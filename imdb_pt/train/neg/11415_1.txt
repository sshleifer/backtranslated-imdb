Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a cliche-ridden piece of junk. A high school comedy in a military training camp. Sorry, I had to give the 1 star I did not deserve. <br /> <br /> This may contain SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Almost everything is totally forced, unconvincing and unrealistic. HEPO (military police) will not pick you up if you do not make your appearance, especially on your wedding day. The actors were quite embarrassed during this scene, because the scene did not work, since it was highly improbable. You can feel it in your voices. Even if they were not so bad, they could not save the scene. <br /> <br /> Then the guy has to work out in his wedding dress. No, there was no time to get a uniform first. Dude, this is great cinematography! I'll remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also GIRLS in the camp - exciting - one of them even a model, though they may not look so good - and the worst actress I've ever seen. I doubt that in Hollywood they would let her say a single line in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Ok girls in the military! Now this is getting fun. The girls are placed on the same floor, so we can sneak into your room at night! In fact, they would be placed in a different building 400 meters away, separated by two fences with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There are tanks available that we can use for a fun ride in our spare time, of which we have a lot. No, the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the sound of the engine, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line. We need them for sexually obsessed Germans to enjoy the movie as well. Switzerland is a very small market for any feature film. Very well! <br /> <br /> A sex scene happens in the kitchen. Of course, none of these facilities is blocked. Military routines are as sloppy as possible. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the mafia men are about to take revenge on the poor guy trying to kill him! Because he abandoned his bride! Of course I buy this, the Italians are like this - a jealous (no) group. <br /> <br /> Bandits try to do this in broad daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Once again, military training camps (where there is live ammunition shooting) are open to the public, anyone can drive freely or get in there. There are no such things as guards or fences. <br /> <br /> The deed, however, is prevented by the good captain from launching a rocket into the Italians' car. The explosion knocks down the gunslingers and the enraged bride. No one 40 feet away gets injured when the car is burned to pieces. It's a COMEDY, remember. <br /> <br /> Okay. It's a comedy, I have it, and I can live with it. No realism is necessary. Filmmakers can easily get along with it, whether it's hilarious, comic side, fun, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately it's nothing like that. It's just embarrassing. A steal of American comedies without a brain. The latter are at least done professionally, without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It's very annoying and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those seated throughout the film, as I unfortunately did. To yawn.
