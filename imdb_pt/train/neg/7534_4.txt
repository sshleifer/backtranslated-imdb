A mummy recounts vignettes about men, women and the sex between them. There is? At first, the mummy randomly asks the viewer, "Imagine having sex with this girl. Imagine having sex with this boy," about 37 times, while flashing photos of young seminus minions. Later they said mods boys mod girls pelt with vegetables ...? If you ignore (or advance) the ramblings of the mummy, shorts are not bad by themselves. I found some of them quite funny. My personal favorite is one in which the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while her pet lizard sits on the bed. This is a very bizarre movie.
