Please make me forget. Please. Please. This is the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I consider the film an insult to my brain, as well as my butt, which both suffered from me sitting and watching this movie. I am yet to see the damage it has done to my vision and my ability to complete sentences. What a load of rubbish !! And do not tell me about acting ... Someone please help me to forget !! "Weird Science" - come back !! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I am "proud" to give this movie the first 1 here in IMDb ... And I have voted in hundreds of films ... Many of them c ** p mas This is so bad that I can not even believe it. Did anyone really come up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a movie? Has anyone actually read the screenplay and decided to produce the film? Did anyone read the script and auditioned for it? Has anyone seen the movie and decided * not * to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity? * These are the questions I want answers to. Not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well, you know ...
