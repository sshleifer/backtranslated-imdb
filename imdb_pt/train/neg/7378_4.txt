Steven, friend, you remember when you said this: "Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without harming others. Live with integrity and morality, not only with people but with all the beings. " <br /> <br /> You have not done it, you've mortally wounded your fans and your morality with these "movies" I would not even bother if I did not know that you're much better than that, I've already seen the videos of you teaching, you're much better than that, cuz why bro, why ... <br /> <br /> productions steamroller was steamrolled i promise mano i'm not afraid of you i'll tell you the truth to your face so we can fix it. <br /> <br /> well I like some others fell asleep 90% in, but to be fair I was tired and had a great meal just an hour before the Sensai hand, what are you doing. 12 million? really? Do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000? It could have been in theaters and a blockbuster, if you wanted, we would have donated money from the huge profit to a shelter or something. These post-production people are tearing you apart, the choreography was non-existent, we can make a better man, the blinking thing was the men's in the black movie, I kind of hope smith appears or tommy lee jones tell them they were gills No eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal you are an Aikido master, why are you doing this for yourself, for us? When you stepped in, you had such a straightforward new style, and it was obvious that you're a teacher because the way your moves were so clear and crisp, watching your first three movies, I felt like you were teaching me something now I Feel like I'm being ripped off or something I feel like I need to save you friend, this time you're the one who was killed and I'm going to get back at you, helping you make the best movie ever. mano I know who you really are, I know the truth about Nico's movie. let's talk. <br /> <br /> contact me guy I got some new ideas I'm a nit picker, I swear you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and let's make it to the fans guy, your fans deserve better , we're holding on, but the wire is about to crack. I swear I will not let your movie come out the door with a single mistake I'm still trying to figure out if this was the worst dubbing ever, or you have laryngitis but I promise you that I can make a better impression of your voice than the lame one who did not even try. I hope you have kicked it as your payment. I can come up with a story and plot that can be compared to your revenge for the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / houseplant niche and I promise you that I will bring it back, I promise, I also want go in the direction, this makes people think, if you let me in I promise that we will make a movie that people will leave and have to have a discussion about it, a serious provocation of thought, perception altering the experience. Steven Seagal This is my official written permission to IMDb to release my contact information for the purpose of resurrecting one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever seen too, for the record he is not Italian, he's Irish and Jew you call it bad acting, I call it incredible action, because you've believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) kind of changes your perception, does not it?
