This movie is not funny anyway, it tries to be funny with its lame mood, which is so dry and annoying that the film is only 2 hours of torture. Throughout the movie I was thinking of one thing: "When will this end?". One thing you have to deliver to them, is that they have very few slightly funny moments, and that's why I gave 2 whole stars. It is not original and uses almost all the old jokes in the book, even those that were not funny the first time. It's basically a movie to belittle blondes and record the entire repertoire of blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, this movie is a bad blonde mood, it's not worth paying any amount of money notice, it's so bad.
