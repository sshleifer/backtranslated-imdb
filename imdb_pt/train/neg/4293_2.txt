"The Rainmaker", released in 1956 - has some of the best actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main characters. Not even they can save it completely on the melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is terribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite his brilliance as an actress, not even she can do it. She is too strong to be credible for being so simple-minded, and too old for the part. Lancaster acts in the extreme, and Earl Holliman is very hammy and comes out more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever-reliable Wendell Corey seem to rise a little above the cast - but even they can do much more. It seems that the 1950s was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that's okay. She just made a bad choice here. Luckily for her fans (me being among them) she did not do many of them. Despite a cast of a list and good production values, this does not work.
