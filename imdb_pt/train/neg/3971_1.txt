Give me back my money! Give me my life back! Give me some credit. This movie was vomit worthy. Useless and time consuming. What a waste of energy and totally meaningless. Okay, I get the premise and the idea, but give us some time! Next time just give me the money and let me spend. Lost child, remorse mothers, blamed her husband! Yes clic! Get a life! Sorry, this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I'd rather watch cooking eggs! No real explanation as to why this happened. Prison? Because? Loss? Obvious, but why? Acting deserves a What am I doing here Oscar and the cinematography a I'm just doing it for a salary? How much did this movie do? Well, that idiot hired a copy. Said enough
