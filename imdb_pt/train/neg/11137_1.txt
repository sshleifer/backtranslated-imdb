All the bare-chested women in the world could not stop me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful garbage. With the ridiculous performance, equally terrible script plus the poor CGI FX to combine; this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre. It's supposed to be serious, which in itself would be funny if this movie could get to the level of being a joke in bad taste. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but too lazy to do something decent up to a room. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf films. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
