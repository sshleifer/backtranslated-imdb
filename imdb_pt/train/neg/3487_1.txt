There's a great moment in "Surviving Christmas" that almost makes it worth it: James Gandolfini breaks a shovel over Ben Affleck's stupid head. <br /> <br /> This film serves as another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini proving what is a great actor at the same time that he stained his career while playing in that film. <br /> <br /> Rich young advertising executive Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) has been ingrained into believing that he should never be alone on Christmas. (And there, from the outset, is the problem underlying our suspension of disbelief in this stupid movie: how many people from Drew's social position in 2004 actually care in one way or another whether Christmas is spent alone or with half the Drew bought a family to spend Christmas on the condition that they pretend to be his, ignoring all indications to the contrary that his money did not buy the emotions he was looking for. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, a grouchy suburban truck driver, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), and his disheveled wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agree to be Drew's ad hoc family, against the protests of his son, Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter, Alicia (a very suave Christina Applegate). Drew then spends the rest of the film supposedly recapturing his youth or - something. The messages in this movie are as distorted and illogical as their dry mouth story. Filled with obvious psychoses, Drew plastered a fake smile on his face and blindly remained in denial against all the slander he was supposedly buying the Valco family to avoid. <br /> <br /> What raises the question: if Drew is paying these people recapture some semblance of cheerful family emotion, how psychotic should it be to feign happiness between their barbs and mental anguish about their presence? It is not a case of the Valco family hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy around Drew - three of the four members make it very clear that they despise him. Is he so incognito that he can not see that his money is not buying the "family" atmosphere that he was ingrained into believing that it was a truth in the first place? As with all movies, it's a wonder, how could the "four" writers get so caught up in their own narcissistic dreams to appear in a sequence of credits that they will ignore any semblance of plausibility or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, who headed Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, stopped by. said Nuff. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow manage to shine, proving their courage in this mess. Christina Applegate is slender and cute and blonde and fiery in all the right places, slashing Drew in small strips of carcass for most of the movie, then making a turnaround and falling in love with it, because the script tells her. And I would not go so far as to say Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider should look better over his shoulder. There is a whole new level of Desperately Seeking Talent in the City.
