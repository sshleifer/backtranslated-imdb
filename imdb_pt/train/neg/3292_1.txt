For this review, a list of good points and bad points. I'll start with the bad. Bad points: The cast choices (especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg), the acting of the chosen evil cast, the plot, the idea of ​​putting the movie in modern days, direction, editing , the soundtrack and, above all, the whole idea of ​​making a movie from a television series that was not so good to start with despite its popularity. <br /> <br /> Good points: Jessica Simpson in a red bikini ............ that's it! <br /> <br /> You can make an analogy here. In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke approaches Michael Weston as Enos, she asks the question, "Enos, where are Boss Hogg and Roscoe?" In his hazy judgment, tells her where they are. he might well have asked, "Enos, is this a good movie?", the red bikini would have obscured his judgment in saying yes, even if in his right mind he would have said, "No, not really." as she looked in her bikini, she could be completely naked, and even that would not have saved this horrible movie from making movies. Stay out of Hazzard!
