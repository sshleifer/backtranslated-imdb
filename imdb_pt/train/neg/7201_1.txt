Luckily I did not pay to see this movie. Also, I can not even reveal any spoilers because I willingly quit after forty minutes of the movie. It was so bad. I laughed once when Yahoo! Billboard fell on the guy, and the theme song came. However, this was only because I thought I was making fun, but then I realized it was more of a product placement. <br /> <br /> I loved the cartoon. I used to watch it almost religiously. (although I've missed the last episode.I heard they show Dr. Claw and it was nothing more than a Claw, someone commented on the program page) The cartoon had Penny and Brain a lot more than the movie had, on this point. I hated the setup of the whole thing, reminiscent of Robocop. Then Broderick squeezes with all the feeling of Inspector Gadget. He is not as clumsy as the cartoon. Another fact is that their appliances actually work to the point I've seen, except for the oil stain. He also spoiled the tone of "Wowsers" which used to be in a lively tone. I felt so disappointed that they killed the drawing so badly. Everyone felt that way too. We 14-17 years remember the cartoon lovingly and we loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> I went into the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would have screwed up with the cartoon. I was surprised by how slow the movie was. It depended on visual jokes and stupid humor dialogs. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to propel a children's movie. Product placement is useless in this movie, and it shows. The car that splits wisely is not so good at breaking. The handsets look cool but were almost overly bright. The cartoon was a better look. The silly scenes sucked. In the 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, not a laugh was heard, and they laughed at Dudley-Do-Right's preview. This movie should not be seen by people who want intelligence in family entertainment. I recommend "The Iron Giant" which was sad but very, very good. This film is a farce for the whole family drama. -------------- 1
