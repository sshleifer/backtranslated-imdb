I own 2 home entertainment stores and I have seen many bad movies in my time, but this was so bad that compelled me to register here and comment on it. How bad was that? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola won an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III when compared to Giada Colagrande's in this film. <br /> <br /> It was robotic and uninspired. Her lover has just died a month before her arrival at the "House of Rubber" he had given her. Once there, she discovers that he has betrayed her throughout her relationship, but none of this seems to register with her. Within a day, she begins a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) the janitor of the house. Even though she was married to Dafoe off-screen, her scenes with him were cool and unemotional. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Not even Willem Dafoe could save this movie from the amateur and cinematic train crash that it is.
