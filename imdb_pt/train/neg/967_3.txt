In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as a "thinking man's horror film". Wow, you can say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. It has a young actress who has a range of 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad English accent (nicknamed) and a story without chills, emotions or leaks. <br /> <br /> Even interesting psycho. The person will just laugh at their cheap effects and yearns for a Leprechaun 5 exhibit. The story involves a girl with glandular fever escaping in her dreams. What you get is not good horror, art house or even a decent special after school. I found myself after the point of two hours saying ... where were my two hours. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired and I wish it could be pretentious ... something interesting ... it seems the producers were on lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in the dream world, things are boring. <br /> <br /> A little no on this one.
