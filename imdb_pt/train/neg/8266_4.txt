What is * bliep * with this movie? Could not they believe in a better script? In short, a "cool" movie, but ... it was already done more than once ... Until the end, I thought that everything was fine, but ... the return to the previous part ... * barf * So tacky ... I was waiting for the fairy godmother to appear ... but wow, that did not happen ... which is good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but to see such a movie in a new way with another kid who wished he / she is older / older; This is so so so <br /> <br /> Just watch until it comes out on TV. Do not get me wrong, but that's not all
