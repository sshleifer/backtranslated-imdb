I had high hopes for this movie. The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of many Belgian movies, but this movie is bad. It's completely unbelievable that the actors who are now 34 are suddenly playing the role of teenagers. The "language games" were hideous and exaggerated. Nothing about the movie seemed real to me. The end was also very deus ex machina for me. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed and I think I lost an hour and a half of my life.
