I expected a bad movie and made a bad movie. But I could not imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try explaining what Blood Surf is. It's not about blood surfing, it's about a big crocodile. They are complaining about the fake shark in Shark, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark until the end. Here the crocodile is shown many times, and it is the worst false crocodile I have ever seen, and they do not try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile, watch Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad monster-b movie. He got the chance to make an original surf movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand how bad this movie is, does it have any good parts? Not really, it has some nudity, and a sex scene that is taken directly from a playboy movie. The acting is not so bad, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad she does not take off her blouse. The main actors are not bad either. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie starts well with some nice surfing scenes. It's the fault of the writer and director without talent. The dialogue is one of the worst I have ever seen, and the script is really poorly written, and the director has no talent, nor is it a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this. Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fischer. Not worth it. Watch Sirens to watch Kate naked, and watch Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. 3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good (but she's a bad actress) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with work they had to work.
