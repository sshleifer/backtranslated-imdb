If you like wandering movies with little tempered plot exposure with bizarre sex, this movie is for you. On the plus side, the main actor / actress (newly arrived transsexual) has an interesting screen presence, but not enough to add up to much more than a slightly interesting movie - if at all. Essentially, this movie is about 3 social outcasts (transsexual prostitute, male and Russian prostitute, gay immigrant) who somehow developed a bond. Why is not that clear? We are expected to accept these misfits as honest and basic people who have the ability to love as they push their bodies into the street. Right!! And Anna Nicole Smith was truly in love with her ninety-one papaizinhos! The filmmaker shows a brave and unpleasant side of life, while he wants us to believe that all these seriously injured people are really normal, in that they have a menage a trois that helps them in life. Quite a fantasy, but unfortunately portrayed here as a real look of life on the wild side. In short, no plot, no truth and no real reason to spend much time here. Unless you like to enjoy the madness !!!
