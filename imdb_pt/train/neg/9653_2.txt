I'm just wondering what the purpose of making movies like that is? the profit? and who are they referring to what intelligence should use their brains to watch something like that crap? This movie is watched by children under the age of 3, if you are an adult, do not try to watch it. That's the reason I think Hollywood started using cartoons in movies with actors like this, you must forget the art of cinema, have tons of corn to consume for the time until the movie runs out and also have lots of burgers laptop your cell phone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant, but certainly not in a theater, my dog ​​that is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building. Sure is what this movie is referring to to people without demands of the art of cinema. The only thing this movie can be used is to watch it while making the grocery shopping list. I am giving 2 stars to support India's film efforts but for nothing more or less ..
