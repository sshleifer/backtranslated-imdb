Such great actors, a disappointment. Marlon Brando plays and horrible character, the movie is not funny at all, a subconscious message can be seen "IT'S A CRAP DRAM !!!", "This is so bad !!", "play your TV through the window", and coming soon. It is simply disgusting and tiring. In addition to silly plot, sense of humor, there is something else. The way the rooms are decorated, the colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful it can cause epilepsy. Usually I do not care about the decoration of the movie, but this "Free Money" made me angry. Avoid at all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer does not get anything! One looks at the cost of sanity.
