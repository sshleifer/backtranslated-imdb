Half Past Dead starring Steven Seagal in the lead role was a major B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct sequel to the video, an action movie without losing anything but no ability to win anything. It's less fun than the first: in every respect. But it deserves a look. Whether you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch old WWE stars on the screen or even if you like watching sequences, whether they are direct or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think he is not made for work. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did the job, but nothing extraordinary, nothing far from right. <br /> <br /> Technical details as well, a production made by Sony can not be optimal. Cinematography was a disaster, but the overall direction was acceptable. Be that as it may, just watch if you want. If you watch, you will not miss a thing. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose either.
