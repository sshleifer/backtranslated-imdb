I thought it would be at least aesthetically beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but there's a song at the end that's just a guy yelling "Yaowwww!" while someone randomly touches a wooden object. That said, there are some beautiful songs, but it's not worth watching the movie. Go on itunes (they have the album), preview it and choose the good ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy making tea. Well, that's a slight exaggeration. But you'll see what I mean if you see. That said: DO NOT SEE!
