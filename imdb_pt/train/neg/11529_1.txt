Yes, unfortunately I came across the DVD of that and discovered it was incredibly awful. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters are bad. I mean, come on, if some idiot in an orange hat called 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creative idea these guys could create for a character, then they definitely should not be on the shooting scene. Poor "fantasies", bad "interviews", and basically there is a "fighter" throughout this album with any fragment of charisma. <br /> <br /> "Wrestling" in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these. idiots gently and playfully jumping together on a trampoline. They make a point of laughing together all the time, making the experience seem more like a child's play than a "deadly fight." <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a fairly dull Backyard Wrestling clone. Only instead of blood, guns, chaos and WRESTLING, we have a trampoline, children laughing, audio TERRIBLE and a guy named Orange Sherbert. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Avoid this DVD. It's awful.
