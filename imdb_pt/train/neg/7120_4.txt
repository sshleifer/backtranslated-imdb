I saw this movie for the first time on MST3K. And although I laughed at the jokes, I do not think this movie is that bad. Of course it was a bit difficult to understand which is obviously a low budget, but it had a plot very much like Hitchcock and I can honestly say that when I saw the non-MST3K version, I was genuinely entertained. This movie is clamoring for a remake of Hollywood.
