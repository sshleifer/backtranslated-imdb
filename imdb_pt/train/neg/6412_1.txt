I just got back from the movie and I'm completely shocked. This film is a complete mockery for all mankind. The theater I was in maybe had 4 other people. This movie was recommended to me and I could not believe this person liked it. I can not believe any sensible human would like that. There was NO plot at all. It was a joke. How can you make a movie about anything? This movie only shows why Hollywood is in such ruin. I can just look at the spiral of the "horror movie" industry and laugh. What a sham for all filmaking, this is true of all the new "horror movie teens" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's all this crap. Do not support this kind of bullshit!
