I really tried to like this movie, but in the end it did not work for me. I have seen most of Kitamura's exit and have discovered that it is very variable. Vivo, like all his films has an interesting storyline, some cool sequences and a good amount of creativity. However, these qualities are insufficient in Alive. The plot is cool, if not all of the original and could have made a very good movie. Unfortunately, the pace is painfully slow and the movie takes time to get started, before it reaches quite predictable places. The action is almost passable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the oldest on OK. The previous one is also marked by excessive camera work, resulting in less coherence. There are some interesting visual effects and some interesting ideas floating in the dialogue, but the movie still trails poorly. The characters are not well-crafted or well-represented, and the overall scenery and color scheme is monotonous and boring. The film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps the judicious use of the fast forward button can improve it. With about twenty minutes taken from the runtime, this could be a pretty decent science fiction thriller. But the whole movie is boring. Recommended only for fans of Kitumura very patient and determined.
