THE WORST. MOVIE. EVER. MADE. <br /> <br /> After watching this supposedly gay movie, I suspect someone made a brain damaged the neo-Nazi and made him the worst gay film ever, in a failed attempt to attack the gay culture I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come just so I had someone to mock when I stopped the movie by shock, disbelief and outrage at such stupidity. <br /> <br /> On top of all the horrible writing and acting and plotting illogical and stupid, it's just a poorly made movie. A dog with a tail-tied tail could have improved. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews that this movie has here, I suspect the writer has a half dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this movie is even watchable for anything other than a joke, is a liar or being paid heavily to say so.
