All I can say is that before watching the movie, I had no indication of who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was ... and I have to confess that the film would hardly help to get that data. was not successful in persuading me to do some research by typing a few words on the google website; however, all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was great with her mute facial expression, she actually played well and showed a state of deep depression, as it is real. <br /> <br /> After all, based on the script of the film happened in Turkey and Tehran as well as in Afghanistan .. but believe me I'm familiar with the area, it was all about an Arab desert in Morocco .. people Turks and Persians are completely different in face and culture as well as in language that is not Arabic. <br /> <br /> I suppose to make a film like this - kind of documentary - a thorough search on all these secondary elements is mandatory.
