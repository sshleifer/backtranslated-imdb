Best of the 4 best, it's better than 3, but only bad. Basically, I say this because part 4 does not contradict parts of 1/2 (as 3 does), (ie there is no reference to Tommy Lee having siblings). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked the Russian plot of the story, and especially part of Sven Ole-Thorsen as Boris. Despite this and some fighting scenes, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially in the scene of the airplane blast). <br /> <br /> In addition, part 4 does not really have a moral or says something like part 3 did, there are a couple of more known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that the Best of the Best is the Rhee show, and to be honest, he can not take a movie. <br /> <br /> Saw tape, Rating: 4
