This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. His lack of subtlety and complexity and his complete political correctness make him really childish, with only good / bad characters. The world is not like that, and good movies show complex characters with impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what I hate most about this film is the father of a friend of Bola. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoos with shaved heads are not always evil, in fact they may be better than an ordinary father (wow, that's ... philosophy, or something). Thank you, Achero. I propose you to the Nobel Prize for literature.
