The secret is ... this movie explodes. Sorry, but you just did it. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff on I know what you did last summer and scream, Beth, played wonderfully by Dorie Barton, together to several friends on a spring break trip. The group rents a chic home and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. Then the deaths begin. First one after another after another of the friends is murdered, leading to a sad and banal climax with predictable results. One note, Dorie Barton is Reese Witherspoon of the poor man, she looks like Reese, acts like Reese and could get through Reese in a police training. Maybe that's how they climb it? Anything, decent filmmaking and just acting could not compensate for the bad dialogue and the terrible writing.
