We hope to see this movie and see these great actors performing. However, I was sadly disappointed with the script and the whole plot of the story. David Duchovny, (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", '04, was the medical practitioner who uses drugs and loses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands was visiting a nightclub and was able to use his medical expertise to assist a wounded client and was assisted by Angelina Jolie, (Claire), "Taking Lives," 04, who immediately feels attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", 04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to have finished acting in most scenes and is completely out of his mind trying to stop his gang members from being killed. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "TV Series CSI-Vegas", plays a major supporting role and portrays a true COUD DUDE, who is the bodyguard called Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips that draws much attention from all men. This movie is not the greatest, but it entertains.
