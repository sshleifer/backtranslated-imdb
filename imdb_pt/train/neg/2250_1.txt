Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) transforms lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a star who sings during the night. Esther's star rises as John goes into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the self-destructive-red-convertible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway thing. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well but you can not take her seriously as a rising star when she is already a star. The first time she appears, singing in an alley bar, she looks like an established singing star who is having a hard time at night, not like a stranger who is trying to start her singing career. She is very confident, too professional. His apartment looks like a "Apartment Living" page, not an apartment on the wall where a true fighter singer would live. Kris Kristofferson deals with the egocentric, out of control the role of rock star as ... well, as a singer who is trying to be an actor, but does not have much talent in acting. The direction is tepid, the story is slow and monotonous. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, the lame direction or the slow story. It's the hair! After staring at the horrible 1970s hairstyles of Kristofferson and Streisand for over two hours, his eyes hurt.
