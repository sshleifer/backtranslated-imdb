I rented this movie because it sounded very interesting, but for my Horror this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen! I read Gumby-8's comment and he has to be part of the cast or crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4-year-old or some insane cult member, no one in their right mind would think this movie had any potential. <br /> <br /> I could not believe Gumby-8's comments. Quoting: "From the opening animation inspired by" Dune "to the fast pace ... this film keeps the eyes moving and works so well that repeated viewing is not unexpected." <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact that the movie keeps the eye moving as well, is why you keep looking for any kind of suspense. I mean, give me a break. Halloween was filmed with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and also, by the way, has become a cult classic. To the extent that "repeat preview is not unexpected", I think he made a typo. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gumby-8, the only fan: "The acting is also a strong aspect of the film." With all respect for the actors, his performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> The captivating Tagline: "Beware the time between dusk and darkness" <br /> <br /> That's because there is no twilight or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> The only gore you see is a red paint on a sheet over a corpse you never see. As far as I know, it can be a lot of grass. <br /> <br /> In short, I've seen horror movies from the 50's, 60's and 70's. I saw what I thought was the worst and some were very good. The director of this film made no attempt, was asleep or suffered an acid attack. Whatever the case, I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very bad job of directing. I would give this movie a rating of 0.5 for a "B" movie.
