Dear me. Where do I start? The father is not old enough to be the father of the girl. He shoots the camera in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The favorite exclamation in this film is "Jesus Christ !!!". The zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between. Reasons are completely incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. People "rush" to their destination in jeeps aimed at 3 MPH. The world seems to remain normal, but these assumptions are the final days. The breasts appear because of the breasts. Normally such an approach would provide some redemption, but the rest of the film really left me uninterested in the bosoms or in the future of humanity. There is a dog with no reason and fine, orange blood that turns the stomach. The General and his slogan "Shut up!" is the only redemption feature. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they did the decent thing and killed themselves.
