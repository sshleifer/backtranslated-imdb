I really did not expect much from "The Night Listener" and I actually never heard of it until I saw the cover on the videostore. However, the film is very effective when it comes to building suspension and tension. At the time, it drags on a bit, but it actually helps keep you wondering what's going to happen and most importantly: when. As the film progresses, the character portrayed by Robin Williams is drawn into some sort of "cat-and-mouse" talk that is obsessed with discovering the truth and existence of a 14-year-old abused child that no one else seems to have ever seen. The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is great for building suspense throughout the movie and you are practically kept in the dark of who is lying and what is real. However, in the end, this kind of disappoints and does not match the potential it might have had. He does not really give a detailed or plausible explanation about the other main character, which would have been useful and interesting.
