I was interested in seeing the play thinking it might be a rough diamond, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible direction (the shooting sequences do not flow), although the director might say that's what he is. going for, looks very uninspired and immature) the issue could have been made by anyone with 2 VCRs and the stock was a low budget video. I would say it was not even something as simple as mini-digital video. <br /> <br /> There are a few simple ways to fix a movie with the director, such as through editing etc. But it's obvious he just does not care. There is so much effort put into this film as a ham sandwich. It could be better, but that would mean extra work.
