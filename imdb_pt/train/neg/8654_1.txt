The film was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a scratch from Joeseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, the River is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a Jeep and Walter Kurtz is Osama. <br /> <br /> The allegations made on the outside of the DVD box was an obvious fraud to bring this fabricated death of a journalist and present it as factual, while some Muslim parties have backed the attacks of September 11 for the treatment of Muslims around the world. <br /> <br /> I warned the Video Store that the movie should be removed from its "Documentary" section and be placed in the war drama area. for almost fictitious accounts of actual events.
