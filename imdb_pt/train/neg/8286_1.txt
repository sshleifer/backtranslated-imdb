- = contains spoiler of original versions and film = - <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Notre dame De Paris musical, I also read the book this summer and I watched film today, at first I was hopeful to watch a good movie, especially when I saw 6.3 discussion point. First scenes were good, but I really expected the theaters scene straight from the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire I felt something is wrong.they do not even kiss the book, even in the musical .. And there was huge gap because Esmeralda being judged by the sorcerer, in the book she teaches her goat how to answer clock numbers or spell word "Phoebe" .. wait, was there a Phoebus was not there? in this film he is a bit of soldier's garbage, the creators made the love of Quasimodo to appear and even canceled the love of Frollo ... but Notre Dame was crazy. His thoughts, his struggles between the love of God and the love of the human being in the movies, we find none of this. All we have is a villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts ... not to mention Phoebe, not to mention Frollo's love, not mentioning jehan (frollo's brother) not mention Esmeralda's mother (maybe it's OK, the plot would have stung a lot) they did not even mention the real story .. (another PS: frollo was not an opus dei or some sect member he really is interested in alchemy, he tries to make gold ... he was stuck to science and religion) <br /> <br /> Finally we do not watch this movie, it's a kind of editing directors for a real masterpiece, and if you watched it before reading the book, God have mercy on you .. you should read to book right away .. <br /> <br /> this movie is worse than Notre Dame II hunch the animated film, spend your time with watch Notre dame de Paris musical .. said enough ..
