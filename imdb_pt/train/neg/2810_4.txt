I'm amazed at the many women voters who even give top marks to this film. My thinking on this movie was that the target audience is adult and male. Women whipped and tortured, merciless revenge and a high count of bodies are typical ingredients, introduced in the history of the cinema by the subgenus spaghetti. The opening and breaking of hands are rip-offs from DJANGO. The SCAMMER, however, does not have the style of, and. DJANGO Score, acting and cinematography are mediocre at best, but if you look at the ingredients mentioned above, you are in the right place here. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
