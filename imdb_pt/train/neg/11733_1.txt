I'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie .. I saw it in Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it in scenes that were not meant to be funny. I felt bad because the main actress was in the audience but honestly the plot for this movie needed MAJOR review..not made sense, in a second the characters question what exactly they are they are smelling ... the next scene they are hopelessly addicted and figure out how to do this? Also the ending just took the cake..I will not ruin the magnificent conclusion..but practically mixed well with the rest of the horrible plot / script ... watch this movie for the comedy if you must ..
