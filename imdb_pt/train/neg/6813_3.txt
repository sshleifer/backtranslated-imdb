Jean Rollin's artistic nonsense about vampires, extraterrestrials and the quest for immortality. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and the photography stunning. The dialogue is insane. It's a laughable mess. Great to look at, but like any semblance of a horror movie or a purely horrible thriller. I'm trying to figure out if we should be scared or not. At the same time is it a post or not? It's a strange mixture of art and horror film that never gets mixed up and although it's nice to look at it, it never seems to "mean" anything, and it's not at all scary, even if the shot or occasional sequence create a moment of frisson pretentious twaddle. Something to leave in the background as a live wallpaper for those who like naked women.
