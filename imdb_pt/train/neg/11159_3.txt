I've seen this movie in a preview and I must honestly confess that I do not really like movies with Meryl Streep. This photo was the worst. Half of the theater did not return after the break in the middle of the movie. I could not blame them, if this was not a true story, there was absolutely no need for the second half of the photo. Just before the film moved forward ten years, I expected the credits to show up.
