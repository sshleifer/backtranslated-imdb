An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies. You get your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and a few other things before the 80's. To disguise he has no idea what's happening in theaters today, he plays in The Matrix. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same film speech as art again. This speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes: ego-super-ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> It's garnished with the tacky effect of having Zizte edited in the movies he's making. For someone who should know a lot about movies, his is cinematically speaking: yeiks. <br /> <br /> To put it in Zizek's own words - I saw 5 \ - \! 7 on the screen last night. , or in the words of a great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most insanely stupid things I've ever heard. At no point in your disconnected and incoherent response did you come close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is dumber now because they overheard this. I recommend you (two) points (only), and may God have mercy on your soul.
