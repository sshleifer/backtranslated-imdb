I did not know much about this movie before I watched it, but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics, so I was interested. What I did not know is that this is not really a story but a bunch of New Age fanatics who love the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say it belongs more to the Documentary category than Comedy or Drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the movie, to give this New Age symposium some kind of plot. His parts of the film look horribly nailed and are meant to show the speaker's thoughts so we do not die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie who falls on the couch. We hear unnamed people ramble over what quantum physics all "means" to them. The plus point of this movie was the speaker from India (I suppose), but I think he appeared for the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Barbara Eden really let go and she goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs. It looks like the DS9 Quark was low on money, and so is it makes a brief appearance in the film. There are a lot of CGI that we should be impressed; body cells are shown as dancing jelly molds because filmmakers have apparently seen Flubber many times. <br /> <br /> The people in the movie say that the Arawak people in San Salvador thought Columbus's ship, the Pinta, was invisible. because natives had never seen clipper ships before, as if people today had some way of knowing. Of course they leave out all this information and just say "Columbus's ships were invisible to the Indians in America." The film takes many of those arrogant jumps. Thomas Young did a double-slice experiment around 1805 and found that light may seem like a particle most of the time, and a wave most of the time. Of course you never know this by watching this stupid film because the only reference to it is that "atoms can be particles and waves." And that should mean that people can walk through walls, walk on water and never grow old if they just want a star !! So I'm sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if she just * believed * hard enough. I'm being sarcastic, but this movie is filled with false hopes and beliefs that the people who defend them are not really guilty. <br /> <br /> These are New Age freaks who have clung to Quantum Theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation, zero-point energy, crystal healing, and so on. If these snake oil sellers really believed the crap they were selling, could not they just wish their paychecks were there instead of appearing in that movie joke? We hear another man with no name, no credentials we know, talking on his couch in front of a fireplace (or TV screen) about how he creates his own life. Every time he was on the screen I wanted someone to hurry and throw a pie in his face. These people take themselves too seriously. Some other bald guy in a suit says that no one really * really * touches anything because there's a magnetic force that blocks it at the quantum level. If only someone had entered the screen and continued to punch him in the stomach, shouting "I'm not touching you! I'm not touching you!" A moral relativist in the film claims that there really is no "good or bad" thing. So it seems all right that Hitler killed millions of Jews to death? Another person says "there is no love". It's just a chemical and we really do not love people, we're just addicted to the chemical precipitation we have when we're around them. I suspect this guy is making this movie as community service for being a heroin addict for so many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly pathetic sequence, where two young adults walk around a wedding reception, seeing everything as RoboCop. They assess whether women are cows, dogs or foxes, and a sexual position appears in the gravel. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she should be photographing and the next day decides to love and take a shower because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked it when the film said that people often find evidence of their preconceived notions. Maybe in this review I'm just looking at what I want to see, but I really wanted to see these people get stoned in the face, and it never happened. <br /> <br /> If you've never heard of any of the ideas presented in the movie before, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas here. If you want to watch a good movie that talks about Heisenberg's Principle of Uncertainty, go see The Man Who Was not There. If you want to read a good book on Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with creative visuals, see Waking Life (although it may seem boring, self-important and pretentious at times). All in all, you should go read Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting your time on this movie. <br /> <br /> I usually have a lot of trouble giving the movies a 1 to 10 rating, but this was very easy for me: 1/10 Stars. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is true. The people in this movie do not know # $ *! Hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen.
