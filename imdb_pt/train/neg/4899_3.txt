After Harry Reems's teenage girlfriend is raped by Zebbedy Colt (The Night-Walker), Reems becomes discouraged and consoles having sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Colt, who carries a cane and dresses like a magician, rapes a few more women. Eventually, Reems decides to locate him and end his wave of crime. Despite being filmed on film and marginally unpleasant, it looks like any other 70's porn and runs ineptly. The rape / abuse scenes are surprisingly contained and the attempt to make money with "Death Wish" is laughable. R. Bolla ("Cannibal Holocaust") plays a policeman. Colt, which is usually exaggerated, wig in some scenes, but he behaves very well with my money. This roughie could have been much rougher.
