This movie is scandalous. by outrageous, I mean horrible. I had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an August day while suffering from migraine and sunstroke. the performance became progressively worse as the "movie" progressed, and the directors' use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached. When the haze was shot dead, she decided it would be prudent to blink after the bite. this was not smart. In fact, stevie wonder could have caught this with her eyes closed. If you're deciding between playing with a nail gun while you're intoxicated and watching this movie, keep in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
