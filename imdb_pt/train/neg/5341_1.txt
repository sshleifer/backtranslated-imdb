Loaded with good actors, I expected much more from "Deceiver" than was delivered. The plot is extremely artificial and manipulative. The many flashbacks just add to the confusion. Credibility flies through the window and with the end it becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous. I strongly recommend that anyone who likes their movie scenarios be based on something that is at least possible to avoid the "Deceiver" because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I'm just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the plot and especially with the ending. Clearing the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the whole movie did not make sense. - MERK
