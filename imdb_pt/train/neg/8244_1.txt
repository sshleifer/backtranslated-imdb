I think this movie should be shocking. But the only way it's really shocking is how shocking it was done ... and it just is. It's an hour and a half of torment. Even more to the viewer than to the characters in the movie (the five girls). <br /> <br /> Of course the main characters take their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically good, since it's a horror. movie. And I (usually) like horror movies. I have no problem with violence in this type of movies itself. However, all the violence in this movie has no end. It is not a spectacle unless it is simply grotesque. It's so annoying that it even gets boring, and very fast too. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if the above was not bad enough for you) about this movie is that they tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project by filming with cheap handheld cameras. But (again, this too) has no end. In "Blair Which", sure, there is an explanation, that is, they are yours with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this movie, there is no other explanation than: "Hey, we want it to look like Blair Whitch !!" The sound in the film is also something to be depressed. The girls are screaming so hysterically that you often can not understand what you're saying. Moreover, no effort was made to make anything better, sensible, or otherwise. <br /> <br /> That finally there is the soundtrack, which is as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro. home to the worst dirty hard-rock ... <br /> <br /> My advice: Do not watch this under any circumstances.
