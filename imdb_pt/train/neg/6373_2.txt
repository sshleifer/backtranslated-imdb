Oh, this was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is fine but I think she acts maliciously through the movie, not because she's having her organs ripped off by a crow at night, but because she's thinking about firing her agent by putting her in that piece of crap. . Faye Dunaway acts as if she's remaking Mama's Sweetheart and the ending is completely silly. I really can not recommend this movie even though as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was intrigued a bit by references to his work (Ravens, curse of Usher's family and buried alive) - yet he would probably turn in his grave if he knew about this movie.
