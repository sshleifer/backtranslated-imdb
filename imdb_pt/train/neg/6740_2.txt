Too Much Something Borrowed B- <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in movie theaters every year. Because of this, movie studios tend to avoid throwing bigger movies over the weekend. From time to time, a studio releases a female counter-programming film ("The Wedding Planner", 2001) to compete with the big game. This Super Bowl weekend, titled "The Wedding Date", will try to find success and attract viewers who do not watch the game. Sick of people who feel sorry for her, single woman Kat Ellis (Will and Grace's Debra Messing) hires Nick (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt") to pose as her boyfriend to the wedding of his sister in London. Her family is giving her a lot of hard work not to be married, and her seven-year-old ex-boyfriend who has abandoned her for no reason is the best man. To make him jealous Kat parades Nick around his ex to make him see what he is missing. But finally Nick helps Kat realize that she can open up and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> The film borrows too much from similar wedding movies. It's almost a carbon copy of 1999's "Picture Perfect" and mixes scenes similar to "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding." The film also has a reverse theme "Pretty Women," and knowing its audience, the director makes clever references to this and other films. "The Wedding Date" has all the clich√© elements of a typical wedding film, there is the stereotypical authoritarian mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde"), and practically plagiarized marriage speeches from family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner. The turnaround at the end was already made before, but was something that was not fully expected. The real reason Kat was cast comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the movie for the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Even though "The Wedding Date" is predictable, it is able to stand on its own. . Debra Messing, in her first leading role, proves she can be charming and funny. Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogues were very tacky and unrealistic. He is able to take full advantage of what he is given and save the character. <br /> <br /> By using many clever (usually sexual) puns, the movie is really funny. Although mostly a girl movie, the movie has components that everyone can enjoy. The story feel good, and humor make the best date film released in a long time.
