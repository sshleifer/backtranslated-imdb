This is a great step after the original surprisingly nice. This sequence is not as fun as the first part, and it spends a lot of time developing the plot. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his joking is toned down in this entry. The performances are all appropriate, but this time the script disappoints us. The action is merely routine and the plot is only slightly interesting, so I need a lot of silly laughs to stay entertained during a "Trancers" movie. Unfortunately, the laughter is few and far between, and so, this movie is, at best, watchable.
