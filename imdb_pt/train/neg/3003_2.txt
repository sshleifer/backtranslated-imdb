We all know that countless failures embellished the 1980s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust. Maybe it's a little hasty, but if "Slaughter High" was not terribly unoriginal, even for a horror movie. Nicely, the plot involves a child who has suffered a humiliation in Carrie-like shower in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek revenge on a group of ex-bullies who all show to remember. Unsurprisingly, they are killed steadily by a madman masked on April 1 through electrocution, burning, hanging, and chemically altered beer. I have a lot of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie, but considering the ending, I feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time. Ignore any thought of watching this movie ...
