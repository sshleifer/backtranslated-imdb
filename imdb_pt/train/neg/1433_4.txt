The pictures are great and reflect the landscapes of Canada well. The story was, on the other hand, rather boring; To my eyes, it was a love story in the woods just as Titanic was a love story on a boat. I did not feel that Gray Owl was a great environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this one was ... bad.
