Warning: Spoilers Galore! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton redoing this sui generis movie is as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh, it's true, some idiot has already done it - I rest my case. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with chimpnaut wandering a simulation, proving he is not so smart from the start. Marky Mark appears on the scene without the characteristic underwear, then is rejected by a simple woman who prefers the touch of the chimpanzees. <br /> <br /> The shot that sets the space station in Saturn's orbit for no apparent reason, vessel-busty inside with genetic experiments on monkeys. Should we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimpanzee gets lost in that 60s sci-fi scene - Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the ineptitude of space station safety by stealing a cocoon without anyone noticing at the same time demonstrating its stupidity in setting up a rescue mission in a wormhole for a disposable chimpanzee with a million dollar vehicle Supply limited fuel and oxygen. Before anyone can say `meaningless remake 'Marky surfed the wormhole, crashed into an alien planet, removed his helmet without thinking about the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased by a sonic stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest if it were not for the searchlights illuminating the plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! It is APES doing the chase - or at least, * it would have been a surprise if no one had seen the Planet of the Apes for THIRTY-THREE YEARS. Since Marky Mark could not show his pecs. , take off his pants, or break his rap, he has no character. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth, being inserted tortuously, helped immensely to establish his characterlessness. Helena Bonham-Carter (an annoying chimpanzee activist), missing out on a Shakespearean script, did a great job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke like most cardboard cutouts. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave merchant, asserted the role of comic relief and interspecies. Although I grew bilious at hearing the puns on this movie, a headline review captured the essence of this "re-imagining": "The Apes Of Roth." While everyone else bothered to figure as extras for One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth as Chimpanzee Thade chews huge amounts of scenery and throws kaka splendidly. As funny as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character did not have a behavioral arc: Thade goes crazy when we meet him ... and he's practically on the same level of madness at the end of the movie. A cool touch. The original POT (1968) featured a main character, Taylor by Charlton Heston, who was so disenchanted with humanity that he left the earth for space without regrets - even if this film progressed, Taylor unintentionally met him, locked in a battle to prove the worth of humanity - as their only champion! The original film was finally a tale of humiliation, not of salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species did not prevail. Is there anything cerebral or ironic about Marky Mark's Leo? Or is Roth Thade? No, but there is a lot of running. <br /> <br /> The slogans scream: Take Back The Planet. but it's the APES planet. In this film, humans and monkeys landed here, humans degenerated into cave dwellers, allowing the monkeys to acquire speech and the sensual breastplate; the monkeys that deserve to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking for granted that humans have to be the top predators simply because they are there. "Getting back" is as ridiculous as the monkeys that arrived here in 2001, complaining: "A planet where men evolved from APES ?? !!" and then causing problems with his excessive and hairy. <br /> <br /> Heston was cast in the POT of 1968 because he established his reputation as a dissident: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! Casting him as the dumb and stubborn animal in an alien society was dulling the expectations of an audience: How crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton can not demand respect? Marky Mark currently only established that he has tight briefs. <br /> <br /> Although Heston was constantly denigrated by monkey advice, he dominated the screen with his charisma and super overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in Mongoloid humans, it's as if that unpopular school guy is suddenly monitored in class, telling him to stop drawing his penis on a blackboard and throwing a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to the icon of humanity, but he comes off as a deviant. In the original film, the monkeys considered Taylor a deviant, but he was, to the audience and the apes, an icon of humanity. That irony again. It was fitting that a man who would elevate the scene - chewing an acting technique - Heston - was the father of the movie's prime scene, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's monkey father, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, turning against the HUMANS this time, 'Curse them! Damn you all to hell! '<br /> <br /> The film is dumb and dumber in the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky a beating lesson, a cocoon descends from above with Marky's chimpnaut. Monkeys demonstrate their hebetude bowing in reverence to this unknowable creature, while Marky proves his own hebetude muttering, "Let's teach these monkeys about evolution." Firstly, they are not monkeys, you monkey! Second, they were genetic forgeries and inventions of stupid parcels that brought the monkeys to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blasting them with the hidden laser is called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> Giving away the end of the twist would only confuse viewers into believing that the half-nekkid role of Estella Warren was in fact. part of the plot (still be my pants). <br /> <br /> It did not matter that he was humanity's last detached hope; in the end, the police monkeys take Marky to Plot Point Prison, where he was last heard hooting: "It's a hospice! A MADHOUSE !! ... '
