[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] The reputation of this film precedes it, so it was with anticipation that I sat down to watch it in the letterbox in the TCM. What a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is superb and the production values ​​are top notch, but the characters have no depth, the plot is thin and everything goes on for a long time. For a film that deals with alcoholism, family divisions, infidelity, gambling and sexual repression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless and clichéd. One example is the picture of Frank Hirsch's infidelity: his rather heavy request to his wife to "get up and relax a bit" followed by his predictable headache statement leads - even more predictably - to his nightly connection with his secretary. ("Hey Nancy, I have the blues tonight. Let's take a walk"), all according to a well-used formula. We did not feel these are real people, but cardboard cutouts acting on a puppet piece. Moreover, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never actually explored or explained. Dave's passion for the new Gwen is inexplicable due to his inability to defecate or leave the pot. Her subsequent marriage of despair to the character Shirley Maclaine / Ginny is, from the moment she was introduced to this spectator, in any way, obviously doomed to failure, and it became clear - by the conventions of this type of novel - that could only be solved for someone to be killed. By the time the jealous lover started running with the gun I started betting on myself who - Dave or Ginny - would be killed. The whole thing was fake with a capital 'P'. <br /> <br /> That said, the performance of Maclaine and Dean Martin are the highlights here. But overall, I think the film's interest is purely that of a period in Hollywood's history.
