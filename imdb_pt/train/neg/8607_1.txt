<br /> <br /> The movie "Slugs" is unique because the headworms are actually the good guys in this horrible tale of nature that went awry. You see, these poor slugs were mutated through the pollution of evil humans and do not intend to do anything malicious, they are just slugs-slugs with sharp teeth that eat meat and excrete poison but slugs nonetheless. The real thugs are the humans, who either try to destroy our beloved slugs or exaggerate when they find them. <br /> <br /> For example, look at the scene where the guy puts the glove full of slugs. They were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came to them, and they reacted instinctively, defending themselves and biting the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite, this guy runs around his stove screaming like an idiot, pours highly volatile chemicals, lights a fire, hits a bookcase on himself and cuts off his own hand - afterwards fire and volatile chemicals mix and your house explodes. How can you blame the slugs? <br /> <br /> This film paints a picture of humans that is less than supportive. The characters in this movie include the idiot sheriff who hates everyone, the drunken jerk who is mean to his dog, and the erratic helper whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There is also a group of drunken teenagers who are attacked while copulating, and we have to see the genitals of long thin hair. Meanwhile, there's a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson screaming, "You do not have the authority to declare happy birthday!" for some reason. Finally, this disgusting parade is completed by the face of the classic MST3K "People Pod", whose face explodes after eating a salad of slug-laces (another easily avoided destination blamed for the useful and harmless slugs). <br /> <br /> Human beings are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic and, in a senseless scene, as alleged rapists. In the climactic scene of the film, human villains try to burn the slugs that are shrinking impotent in the sewers. Well, since they are idiots, humans can EXPLORE THE WHOLE CITY. They alone do more damage than the slugs ever did! <br /> <br /> If you hate humans, and I know you do, you'll like "Slugs". If you are a fan of bad movies, you will also appreciate this crapfest from the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People". There's a lot of bad acting, silly dialogue, illogical twists, lame special effects, nonsensical scenes and bad dubbing to get your attention.
