My wife and I watched a movie nightly, with no distractions, and mostly artistic movies that require thought. I have a lot of patience for movies that are slow to bloom. My wife has twice as much attention as I do. All that has been said - this movie is simply empty and boring! He did not go anywhere. Never flourished. It started pretty strong with a promising plot ... so she makes cookies ... goes to Spain ... she's in a bad mood, she looks ... the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts and dead ends. We FF'd through several extended strings of her just looking into space. The artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautifully filmed girl movie that pretends to be deep or artistic. You never know or understand Morvern. About halfway through, you do not care anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the lines of the plot developing. Do not waste time on this. I'm shocked at the high score.
