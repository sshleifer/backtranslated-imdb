The definition of an abomination defined by Webster's Dictioary is "a cause of disgust or disgust." If anyone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark, please let me know, because this is the best I can do. However, I do not feel that, anyway, this word describes how horrible this movie really is. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with two of my roommates. One has very like me, the other is an action / adventure guru. This last guy usually does not care about the size of the plot holes, as long as the film contains many explosions he will leave satisfied. <br /> <br /> Having said that, we entered the theater for Friday from alone in the dark. Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I knew why. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst opening scene of any movie, and unfortunately I have to admit it only worsens from there. The opening scene is a 5-minute scrolling text that is narrated. However, I understand why it was narrated. The director must have understood that only illiterate people would come to check the thought of PAY to see this movie. However, this first scene is not only the longest scrolling text in film history, but it also does not make sense. It seems that in the same sequence we are listening to completely separate the films. One is about an ancient civilization and its adulteration with a portal, the other is about a mad scientist and his experiences with orphans. If you are reading this and you are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> So begins the terrible plot, acting, effects, and camera work. Tara Reid is horrible as an actress. She does not do anything for a second to think she's a museum curator. Slater is just bad, not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing created by man. The whole time I and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like: What is this? And what is happening? In addition to this garbage rolling, we have some sequences narrated by Slater himself. They are good? DO NOT. Do they explain anything? DO NOT. Do we, at some point, as a public, have the slightest clue as to why we should care about what happens? Again, NO. <br /> <br /> So we have a random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reid are together, but at no time do they act as if they cared for each other. But then BAM ... sex scene. Again I do not know. <br /> <br /> A good, oh, I do not know, 30 seconds after the pitiful scene ends, we have a gunfight with 20 or more military and a similar number of alien things. This is defined as a heavy-metal track and causes more cerebral haemorrhage than was thought possible. <br /> <br /> And if that was not enough ... <br /> <br /> There is no main villain. There is the scientist and there are "alien" things. At one point, the scientist controls alien things and stands on a hill, ordering them to attack the military outpost. Because? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why do they listen to him? Once again I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did alien things break? Did the military tell them? Who knows ... and who cares at this point? I did not and you will not. <br /> <br /> But on top of that, Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing. Although it has been stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight. And that's true, you guessed it, it's in the middle of the day and it's as bright as it can be. Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know and I do not care. <br /> <br /> Now, after the movie was over, I ran out of the theater, all three feet from me, waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie. Even my roommate (who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of blast into a movie to be the best thing ever created) admitted that the plot holes were very evident in this movie. <br /> <br /> To summarize this CRAP-FEST I give a 0.0 / 10 and would give a smaller amount if I could. <br /> <br /> Unquestionably, the worst movie ever made. I would not want this movie on my worst enemy.
