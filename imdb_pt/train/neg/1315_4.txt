Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon discovers that his uncle is coming to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is they do not exist - Ollie apparently invented them! So it's up to him and his friend to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to be her family. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly unique story idea, as I've seen at least a couple of other silent shorts with that exact plot. The best of them was Bobby Vernon's DO NOT KID ME. It's so much better than ONE TOOY - probably a lot of it's a decade later - when the comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on useless antics. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some comedy movies, people start firing wildly, kicking and strangling each other, etc., with little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of a lot, that's exactly what they do. None of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas. Overall, not exactly a landmark in entertainment. There simply is not enough reward to deserve to watch, unless you're an obsessive, silent fan like me.
