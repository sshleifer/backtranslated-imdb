Two straight away: I really think Joe Don Baker might be good or even great with the right stuff and the right director (the remake of "Cape Fear," a small part in "Goldeneye," "Walking Tall"). And I even liked Baker in "Mitchell" because he was playing an anti-hero who was supposed to be immovable. Yes, MST3K coverage was hilarious, but they took many cheap photos of Baker - which he did not deserve - to keep things lively and entertaining - it was appropriate to the level and tone of the film, and it was the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> "Final Justice" seems to be more of the same, but despite exotic locales and the theme "Cowboy Frontier Justice," it is a bit weaker than "Mitchell". And the main reason is that Baker's character, as written, is an idiot. The film has the presumption that, as Baker incorporates the old-style frontier machismo, he challenges his opponents to fast-paced, hand-to-hand, old-style contests. And because he is so tough and macho, he always wins, even when he is injured, wounded, fewer, etc. <br /> <br /> This is a concept with a lot of potential (it worked for Gary Cooper), even though it is the movie's "B" movie status. But Baker is so stupid and obsessive that he unnecessarily challenges three of the bandit's men to a confrontation in a public market, with civilians all over the place. He COULD simply have them shaded in the chief thug's seat (and that's why he was following them) and they would never have noticed. Or he might have fallen on them and forced them to surrender, and got one of the henchmen to take him to the headquarters at the point of the gun. But no, he has to be a bush hotdog and a macho hardhead, and then he gets a child hostage in the shooting that followed! <br /> <br /> Is this a guy we should admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like that. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK (the henchmen) and very good (the evil boss and his father, who are two well-known European actors - they just follow the moves but they are professional and even hinder it. are decent). But in spite of everything, Baker's character does silly and unproductive stunts and mistakes that cause at least two relatively innocent people to be killed, plus some thugs who could have been caught alive without the use of lethal force. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, since 90% of the film is in Malta or in the Mediterranean, you can see many beautiful scenery and many beautiful and exotic extras. And really, Baker himself may be on the heavy side and a bit dyspeptic, but he's not that bad ... certainly not the lard that these movie critics (including Mike and the Bots in their hilarious coverage) seem to think < <br /> In short, this movie is good for video wallpaper, but the viewer should not pay attention to it.
