Have you ever had that itch to kill an hour or two doing chores and watching such a bad movie that defies reason? Well, while renting movies on a weekend, I see box art for this and I see the T-Rex. Knowing very well that the dinosaur in the pack was the Jurassic Park T-Rex, I knew I had to rent it because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed the least. <br /> <br /> Wacky scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned with its fortune and its shareholders than with lives, and of course with a big and badly excited T-Rex of sock puppets. Am I, throughout the film, there were clearly separate scenes from other films? Not to mention that Rex's hunger is never satisfied ... ever. How hungry he is is beyond me because he does not really have a throat. (Really, if you look down his mouth when he roars, it's solid ... like a toy or something). Now, I enjoy watching B-Movies incredibly bad once in a while because it reminds me how much better a blockbuster movie is. This was hilarious. I'm not even sure if this should be a thriller or a comedy, because there are scenes where, make no mistake, you'll laugh. <br /> <br /> I blame the budget of the movie ... yes, but the acting also did not help. OK, Tony Todd was really very good, as for some of the female roles ... when you cry should not "tears" come out? Meh, I will not get mad at this movie, I knew what I was getting myself into and if you are looking for a bad movie to watch with friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, then watch Jurassic immediately Park and then Lost World back to back. You'll be writing thank-you letters to Mr. Spielberg the next day.
