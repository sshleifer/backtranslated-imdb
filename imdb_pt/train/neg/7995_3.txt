I remember watching this movie when I was young but could not remember the title and then go through horror movies that I found and think to myself "is that the title?" This film is a kind of combination disaster / insect attack movie with fewer notable stars in it. It's also a bit annoying as well, as it has that TV vibe where you can watch the movie disappear for commercials and such. The plot has this kind of resort being invaded by ants. I think they were a bit disturbed by the construction or something happening nearby, but do not cite me about it. The most memorable ant attack for me throughout the movie was the first involving the boy who falls into the pool after being invaded and of course the Summers attack scene as well. What stands out most in the latter is the very silly ending, where survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end, like most television movies, this movie is very tame and not too scary unless you panic when you see ants.
