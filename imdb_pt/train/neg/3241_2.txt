This movie had potential, but what really makes it bad is the performance of Lindsay Crouse. I've never seen her in anything else before and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there who like her in something else, but her performance in that movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Your delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines, it looked like she was trying to make sure she had the right lines and was simply reading the list in her head. So her voice has very little inflection. I can not believe that someone so bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. She has to meet someone in business. <br /> <br /> Now I hate being mean to her, but the comment has to be "that" long and her performance is what stands out more than anything else. <br /> However, I liked where the story was going, so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script is the result of a good movie. But the ending was also disappointing. Maybe if his acting was better, I would have liked it.
