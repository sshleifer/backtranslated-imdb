This movie sucks! They took something from my childhood and raped in a bathroom! This movie was so bad that I wanted to go home and hold my "Dukes" dvds and cry in a corner. The cast was terrible! It was not "The Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was Boss Hogg wrong? When was Rosco a tough guy? They never were! Chief Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke marijuana? He never did! Now do not get me wrong, I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but there was no place in that movie! The only good thing about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the final credits. It was a waste of time and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
