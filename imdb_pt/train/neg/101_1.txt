Amateurs, no budget movie can be surprisingly good ... this, however, is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, another atrocity by Brad Sykes. The acting is horrible, except Emmy Smith, which shows some promise. The "direction" of the camera needs serious rework. And no more "hold the camera and perform" tricks; simply does not work. Special effects are unimaginable, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you're going to rip an ear, please do not let us see the real ear of the actor under the blood. The scene is tasteless and boring (as well as other Sykes ventures), and music is a cross between cheap motel porn and very bad guitar metal (see scenario review). <br /> <br /> Did I mention the lack of any real plot or character development? Apparently, the screenwriter did not. <br /> <br /> Whoever is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of their other "home movies" (which I'm not going to call) and they're so bad. Usually a "director" will grow and learn from your previous efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> Definitely not even a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing popcorn seeds would be less painful than this effort. <Br /> <br /> Award: The worst military push ever in a movie.
