A stylist stumbles on a cat and falls into a pool, banging his head on something floating on the surface. With quite extravagant effects (this was a TV movie), it floats out of your body. It floats through a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke, and stiff black figures fall into his vision (they look like the mannequins in his apartment). I almost thought I was watching a movie by Jess Franco ... While her friends revive her, a black arm grabs her by the wrist, and she has to struggle to break free. When she is revived, she remembers everything, and has an unpleasant bruise on her forearm. Soon after, she is nearly hit by an out-of-control car that appears on the sidewalk behind her. On Halloween, she decides with her boyfriend to go to Mexico for a vacation. When she gets there, she is surprised to discover that it is the Day of the Dead. They are angry with another American tourist who continues to follow them, and he almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who have had near-death experiences. They all experienced the tunnel, but not the black figures or the next repeated ones escape death. One of them has, and he is very anxious. She is also encouraged to meet with a medium. <br /> <br /> A doctor tells her about the people he calls "Walkers" (the name of the novel on which this was based). They are people who are supposed to have died of a cause that, when examined, proved to have died of another cause. So it's like they keep walking after they die until they die again, but he blames the lack of records. <br /> <br /> I watched it in the 102 minute video, and it seemed very long. I can not imagine that there really is a 192 minute version! Maybe if it were to be watched for two or more nights on TV it would be better to be seen this way than in a session. <br /> <br /> I just read a novel by Gary Brandner, Floater, and if it were he is representative of his work, he is not the most original of the writers. Floater had the common plot of: Chosen in child kills people in revenge. Even the variation was very common: children die and kill people years later, in revenge of the beyond-tomb. And, in fact, it has a point in common with this movie, in which the boy practices the astral projection, and when he is drowned, he floats out of his body like here. I do not know how close the Dead of Night follows his novel Walkers. I understand that the Howling movies do not bear much resemblance to their novels. <br /> <br /> It's a very slow movie, and the special effects and cinematography are actually kept by the (presumably) low budget and made for TV Deficiencies. There are many characters actors easily recognizable in it. It also seems very old fashioned, earlier until the mid-1980s than in 1989. I found it annoying. A much better low budget film covering similar subjects that I do not think has gone so badly is Sole Survivor (1983) (probably the inspiration for the 2000 Final Destination films). Blow the Night Dead away.
