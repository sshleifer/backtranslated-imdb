I really wanted to like this movie, but a lot of it is stolen / borrowed from another job - some of the loans are painfully glaring. The New York Times review pointed out that their singing frog is very reminiscent of the famous Warner Brothers cartoon ("Hello my baby, hello my dear, hello my ragtime girl ..."). But challenge anyone to watch the Fox / Blue Sky Robots animated film (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: storyline - A young inventor growing up, and a single innovative company distributes all the great inventions. cityscape - extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - Robinson's servant robot has a design very similar to that of the Robots, and both films use a kind of retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> All this seems to be in flagrant contradiction with Disney's nasty quote at the end, implying that the company has been a constant innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were practically clones of each other, with some minor adjustments in the plot and the ethnicity). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers seem unable to let history speak for itself, and instead, constantly send objects and noises flying toward us, as though we do not have the time of attention for less. <br /> <br /> The villain is very well designed and brilliantly excited, and it is a pleasure to watch him. Much of the rest of the movie seems to be played together. Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The movie actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short. At the end of this drawing, we are reminded that Disney has never had much interest in innovating or telling good stories - they seem to think that simply getting something on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue.
