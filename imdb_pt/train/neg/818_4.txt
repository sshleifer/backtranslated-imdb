This movie is notable for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'Superman' series, this low-budget feature was made and released in theaters, marking George Reeves 'and Phyllis Coates'. early appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the aperture is reused in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-kilometer deep oil well penetrates the "Hollow Earth", allowing the "Mole-Men" to surface. Forget the other holes (those in the plot). <br /> <br /> Second, unlike most invasion films of the 1950s, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in the preaching and application of tolerance and acceptance of difference. against a furious crowd of segregationist vigilantes. No 'gentle and polite reporter' here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation ("I'll handle it!"), Even helping out in a hospital gown in removing a bullet from a moleman! As a superman, he is kinder than Clark to Lois, but he is also the voice of reason and tolerance, as he bumps into the watchers as "Nazi shock troops." <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from the animated cartoon of Superman in the two series to the live action flying in the Adventures of Superman had not yet been made.
