"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who have been fighting for their rights since Adam and Eve started the loose-leaf system." When "Politics" was filmed, the Nineteenth Amendment, granting women the right to vote, was only a decade old. And the film deals with women's political power as a voting group. Defending the prohibition and closing the clandestine was one of the main concerns of women at the time. Marie Dressler (as Hattie Burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman is shot and killed coming off a speakeasy. She wants the joints to sell closed drinks; and is summoned to the prefecture, after delivering a powerful speech in a demonstration of women. Dressler is supported by her tenants, her best friend Polly Moran (as Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins). Dressler's candidacy for the mayor of Lake City attracts opposition from the city's men; then Dressler orders women to go on strike, denying them, "everything" in the "living room, bedroom, and bathroom." <br /> <br /> The film sounds so much better than it ended. The humor, frankly, is not too good; and presents some unsightly and moderately offensive situations ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to a character from Amos and Andy). And the mix of shootings and slapstick does not mix well, this time around. Producers may have considered making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dressler and characters portrayed by William Bakewell (as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7/25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
