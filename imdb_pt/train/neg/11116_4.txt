This woman who works as a trainee for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. Then she will find out that her neighbor is a photographer. This movie could have had a great plot, but then the plot drains any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is smelling heroin. If they took away scenes where someone smells like heroin, then that would be a great movie. Every time I thought a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really bad to have so much drug use in a movie. This caught the attention of the main plot and a great story about a photographer. Lesbian things did not bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
