Wow, this movie is not just a "new lesson in real bad taste," but also a lesson in "bad movie making." Do not get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence', but at the same time you need to realize when a movie is terrible. If you've lost the plot, the plot of 'Zombie' 90 is about a government plane that carries toxic chemicals that happen to clash with nature, causing chemicals to spread, turning zombies into zombies hideous The next thing you know, zombies are all over town eating live people, while a silly looking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that's causing these people to eat each other - hence the name "Extreme Pestilence ". From then on, all we see are zombies having a field day in all places in sight - nothing but extreme and sickly disintegrations and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and blood. Since this is a German movie, the movie had to be dubbed English, and when you're not laughing at the zombie feed frenzy, the voice actors are pretty hilarious and fun as well. As a user named Unnamed * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER *, there is a scene in the movie that crosses the line between what is acceptable and not acceptable, hence the scene in which a woman who is carrying her infant baby is being driven around their wheelchair by some guy and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. A zombie grabs the baby and tears it to pieces, eating your organs when you hear the baby crying. Wow, this is a REAL REAL bad lesson. Atroz I tell you, atrocious.
