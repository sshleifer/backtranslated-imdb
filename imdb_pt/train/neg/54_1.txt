The only good thing about this movie was the filming of Goldie Hawn standing in her little French-cut bikini panties and struggling to stop a dozen other depraved women from taking off their little cotton top as she laughed and cooed. Ooooof! Their loins rival Nina Hartley's. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot almost killed me. I'd forgotten all of this hidden in the Roladex of my mind until I saw it the other day on TV, where they really blurred their middle in this scene, good pain, reminding me how nice a woman's smoking Goldie Hawn was in the 80's. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
