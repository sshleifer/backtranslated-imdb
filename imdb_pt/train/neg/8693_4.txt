I am from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and I lived in Arlington for a few years. This movie was far from making it look like Arlington. I saw mountains at the bottom of a scene! Texas has no mountains. I think this happens when a movie that should be in Texas is filmed in Canada. The accents are also very bad. They should have gotten Texas actors to play the parts. There are many aspiring Texas actors in Hollywood. The movie is really sad, because it's a true story. I pray that the killer will be found and condemned. The only good thing is that, from his death, we now have the Amber Alert to help find missing children quickly after they are abducted.
