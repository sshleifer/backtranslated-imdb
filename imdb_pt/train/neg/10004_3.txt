"It seems that many critics find the idea of ​​an inedible Woody Allen drama." And for good reason: Bergman's imitations are unbearably wooden and pretentious. And let's make no mistake: critics largely supported Allen's Bergman's claims, despite Allen's lamentable accusations to the contrary. What I do not understand is: why Allen generally applauded his originality by imitating Bergman, but contemporary Brian DePalma was criticized for "ripping" Hitchcock into his suspense / horror films? In Robin Wood's view, it is a strange form of cultural snobbery. I would have to agree to that.
