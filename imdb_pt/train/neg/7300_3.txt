This movie is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods. One of the friends picks up a horrible meat-eating virus. Suddenly, friends take turns in a desperate attempt to avoid contracting the disease. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a horrible movie. On the one hand, try to be many genres at the same time. Is it supposed to be a tribute, a slasher, a black comedy or a horror movie with unintentional comedy? No one can say. There's a serious scene at the beginning and a second alter, it's funny. When the movie tries to be funny, the mood is rather mild, excluding the ending. I really liked the ending. <br /> <br /> But beyond the end, I was quite disappointed and angry. Violence is worthy of fear, farther from the screen than being afraid. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes funny, sometimes scary and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl practicing karate in slo-motion. What should we get out of it? That same girl would bite one of the characters. Should that be funny? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the presentations were decent, and many were quite amateurish. I did not care for most of the characters. I liked the plot, but the execution was horrible. Like a horror movie, I did not know what I was trying to be. I did not find it funny, tense or scary. In the end, you become indifferent, thinking, "Why did I just get through?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to that question.
