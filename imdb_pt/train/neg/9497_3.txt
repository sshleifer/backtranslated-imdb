You have a strong stomach. Holden was actually 55-years-old filming, but looked close to 70 and he only lived another 8 years. At one point, Holden said, "I'm more than twice my age." Okay, try triple grandpa! The theme "old enough to be their father" for which they were filming did not work. Granted seniors sometimes end up with legal teens. More power for them, but that does not mean I want to watch. It is not a question of judgment, but the digestive track. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch and the cars of the 70's, clothes, furniture, etc. is worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to relax to bed. It would have been nice to see Lenz's blonde friend, the one who made her guitar, get more scenes. Pleasantly spacey ... Who was this girl? I'll try to find out.
