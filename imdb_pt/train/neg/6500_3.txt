Look, I'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this, but life is confusing enough. I do not need to watch like this. I dig Anthony Hopkins, great time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew it would be a steaming pile of Quentin. But this thing is not well filmed and is not daring - even if it is artistic. Well-produced films have motives for cuts and quick edits, not that excuse "oh, but it's a realistic interpretation." This thing will make your head hurt. It's the fastest moving image that ever takes you anywhere. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if you do not have the time to watch bad ideas on the screen, skip it.
