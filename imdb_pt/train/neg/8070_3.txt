This is not a very good movie, but neither is it a bad movie. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My friend and I found this movie (we think), so here it is: <br /> <br /> * MAIN SPOILERS BELOW *** First of all, this movie is really very simple after you remove all the messy junk from the unconscious-dream state (95% of the movie). <br /> <Ignoring the crap, what REALLY happened is this: A group of school friends goes to a rave one night. They leave and go into a car accident where everyone except Cassie and Sean die. This is the simplified version. (That's right, I said Sean, stay with me) <br /> <br /> Right after the crash, Cassie is in the hospital between life and death until the end of the movie. This is where the dream part begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul continue after the accident interacting with the other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, the two weirdos and Jude) along with images evoked by her mind (Sean, school and everything else around her). The souls continue to do what was defined as: Annie the rave girl, the 2 weirdos-killers (from the opening scene), Father Jude still helping people, etc. <br /> <br /> We are then taken on a long trip, I have shown many pictures (many of which my girlfriend and I still can not tie), but it all comes down to not being the time for Cassie to die. <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wakes up. in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. His family and Sean are there. This is reality again. She is fine. <br /> <br /> So the director adds some extra spice trying to confuse us again, showing a small stretch of her dream in the wheelchair being strangled. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sean, obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space restrictions, we do not cover anything, but feel free to e-mail us if you want. <br /> <br />
