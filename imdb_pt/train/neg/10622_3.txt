I really do have a fondness for Christopher Lee, but this simply was not for his other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The film does not live up to its premise. It's not so scary, it's overly melodramatic, and draaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, here comes the good part," the good part never came. <br /> <br /> The Evil ones are not convincing at all. Most of the other characters also lacked depth. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I was in the right frame of mind, I might have liked some MSTie-fiction at the expense of the movie but .... Naaahhh ... It really did not seem worth the effort. It was not really very good, it was not really too bad, it was just mediocre.
