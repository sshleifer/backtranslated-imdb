POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Spy Who Shagged Me is an overrated and supercharged sequel. The International Man of Mystery came straight out of nowhere. It was a solitary star that few people had heard. But it was incredibly original, had sophisticated humor and ample humor, always kept in good taste and had a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was much more commercially hyped and hyped about. <br /> <br /> OK, I admit, the first time I saw this movie I found it very funny, but it was only after watching or three times that you see all the flaws. The performance was good, but Heather Graham can not act. Her performance did not seem very convincing and she was not as good as Liz Hurley at first. Those characters that flourished in the first, (Scott Evil, Number 2, etc.) are played in the background listening and do not have many independent scenes. The film is simply invaded by cameos. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated how they totally disregarded some of IMOM's scenes. When they killed Vanessa at first and had Basil knowing he knew she was a fembot all the time. What was the point of that? They killed Number 2 in the first, and now they bring it back without any explanation. This is supposed to be a spoof parody, I do not think any of the characters have a gun in the movie. It just goes on a trail, further and further away from the point. <br /> <br /> The new characters are very undesirable. The whole joke of the Mini-Me 'ridiculing my size' ages very quickly. Fat Bastard is just an excuse for gross humor. In total, there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is tasteless or recreated from IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this were the first movie in the series, I would probably be easier. But the series began with a dry humor note and then plummeted to a coarse level of humor. So I say, just watch this movie if you have not seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is a final disappointment.
