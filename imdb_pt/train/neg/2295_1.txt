Stupid boring movie with charismatic Mercury completely wasted. Launched for a minute on a Thursday at perhaps a local movie theater and avoided by all of Sydney's population except me and four others, BACK OF BEYOND is a project apparently created by a producer who is looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well Polson has turned into a director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio never seems to get a guernsey beyond thug roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia's biggest exports onscreen. Papers like this are big disappointments and movies like this are just a waste of talent and time.
