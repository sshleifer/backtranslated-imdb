Like most festivals, Hamiltons makes an interesting story: a movie that has all the ideas and little execution. Although impressive for its obvious low budget, the film fails in its final turnaround and becomes terribly long during its conclusion and obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of murderous exiles trying to survive after their parents died. They kidnap people, drain their blood and feed something locked in their basement. There are some humorous and obscure performances by Mckellhar and Firgens, and the others are just more or less. The film never seems realistic or very disturbing for this matter. But for the first half beats in an oddly humorous and dark mix that is an amazing achievement. The next half is not as successful as it gets in the way of film forgetting with unrealistic twists in a ridiculously arrogant ending that turns the whole movie into complete crap. It is a pity that there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and, although deeply flawed, remains original and creative. very bad that when it comes to delivery, it fails completely on all levels. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
