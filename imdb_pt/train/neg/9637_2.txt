Boy, this was a bad movie! Although I have not seen all the Burton / Taylor collaborations, I can confidently say that this is the worst. This rich but sick woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in Meditteranean, ruling over a team when it is suddenly visited by this traveling poet, who speaks nonsense. In fact, the whole movie is just a festival of conversations, with much of the conversation making no sense. Even in 1968, no one could think of this pretentious nonsense, and the passage of time makes this even clearer. If it were not for the beautiful cinematography and landscape, it would deserve a negative rating. The only good thing about this movie is its unintentional laughter at the expense of the stars.
