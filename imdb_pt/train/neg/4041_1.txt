How to wear a hair shirt. Positively, absolutely, without a doubt, one of the worst movies of all time. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. A long, tedious, elaborate, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical, and artistic scene behind the other. Intended to be dreamlike and impressionistic, the soul stripped, is, on the contrary, mush morose. <br /> <br /> Seminar, father and son palpate and whisper to each other as lovers. "Erotic Homo" is the high point and clear. Okay, so what? <br /> <br /> Repeated more than once by the son is the line, supposedly taken from "Lives of the Saints", "The love of a crucifying father. A loving son lets himself be crucified." The parallel with God and his son, Christ, is heavy, irrelevant and bombastic, like everything else here. <br /> <br /> Some reference points to the theme of Russian Filiality: "Mother and Son" (1997); "The return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "parents and children"; and, of course, Dostoevsky, "The Brothers Karamazov." <br /> <br /> The credits in English indicate the intended international distribution, which means that you can not use the excuse that you have to be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> This is not nearly as complete or convincing as Sokurov's last "Russian Ark" (2003). <br /> <br /> As in his "Mother and Son," an equally powerful soporific, some scenes are filmed from distorted mirrors, though not as interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, photographed from start to finish through beige filters, making it as visually as dramatically numbing. A mist of soft focus only increases the drugged sensation. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack lights up, never closes, like a ribbon bow. An old radio plays constantly in the background. Russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as "themes based on Tchaikovsky." The presence of a "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) means, of course, that all those little annoying, static radio, noise, distortion, and other sounds are "projected." <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that someone (Sergei Potepolov) actually wrote this thing. Everything seems as arbitrary as the traffic, as if improvised by bored actors, coming from nothing at all. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally managed to mean the thing without being the thing, so what we see is the idea of ​​the idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell, merely the idea of ​​a shell . Could anyone ask for a better definition of decay?
