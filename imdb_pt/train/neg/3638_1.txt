The film portrays France's unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in West Africa through the confusing and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (here symbolically representing her nation). It is an often engaging and challenging picture of a young woman's desire to accept a traumatic moment in her past in particular, and a nation's desire to reach out to the "other" it once "possessed" and molded. This is reflected in the way in which it focuses entirely on the notion of traveling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; they recalled realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic realities. <br /> <br /> All characters have a symbolic role, albeit limited and unconvincing. France, intended to be a visual and totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves a person indifferent to its situation, for it still seems to be imbued with the same naivete as it enjoyed as a child - indeed, as a child, it seems more possession of its reality . The rest of the label set is just forgettable. African blacks are, to say the least, impressionistic portraits of colonized peoples, now colonized by the mismanagement of the material by the director. They are nothing more than a dark and dying background, against which France, like France, asks herself to seek a world she has never known, and waiting for one that can never be found in Cameroon.
