Pedant, overlong manufacturing trying to register the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. It begins quite promising, with an investigation still relevant on the explosion of an airplane, nevertheless the melodrama involving James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles ends up disturbing (Miles had the habit of throwing warm wives under duress, and his worn out nerves arrived here cronograma) . Dear director Mervyn LeRoy coordinated this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the image does not impress much. The best performance is presented by Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, however most of the dialogue is ridiculous and the persistent pace makes the film look twice as long. * 1/2 of ****
