I'll be honest. I'm not one of the politically correct films where the woman plays the ass that will not take any crap from anyone. If any of the cast members wanted to, they might have just gotten it out in the blink of an eye. It was fun on MST 3K, but did not rent the real version. Trust me. Did I ever lie to you?
