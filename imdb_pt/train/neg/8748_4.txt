It was interesting to see how accurate the writing on the geek's keywords was, but very naive in the corporate world. The Justice Department would pick up more of the big corporate giants if they did such naive things to win. The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, yet as sinister as it is. I seriously doubt that any corp would actually kill someone directly; even the mod is more indirect these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This movie must have been developed by some garage geeks, I think, and the studios did not know the difference. They just wanted something to capitalize on Microsoft's antitrust case in the news.
