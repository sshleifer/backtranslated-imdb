Oh, it's the movie - I thought I waited a long time to get the dog ... I can not believe I watched the whole thing. I think I was optimistic in anticipation that it would get better. Terribly disjointed dialogue, pathetic acting and totally unlikely events. As Toby's mother hanged herself in the time that Col takes to climb the stairs and back to a room with a 24 '' ceiling and no chairs, counters or anything around her still body that she could have used to climb in yourself. The girl who played the daughter of the last family was the best actress in the entire film, and the first couple's cub was in second place. The basic plot has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously scary movie, but this version unfortunately is not it. I get more scared when I open my energy bill every month.
