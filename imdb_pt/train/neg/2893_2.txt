What should that be? A remake of Fisher King? Why do we care about Sandler's character? What a slow, sad, boring movie that gives a damn about these people !!! Simply painful to sit down, I hung up before it was over. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; like I said: can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in your everyday life? We should not think this deeply, I think. Why does Cheadle continue giving Sandler a chance to become violent in him? If they were such good friends, how did they separate? If Cheadle is so in control, why does he keep seeking the psychiatrist's advice on the street? We are never informed. That's why Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels and because that sucks. Almost 8 out of 10 average scores? I do not agree. Not at all. Even the best movies are lucky to get such a high average rating, and that crap does not deserve to be in the same universe as them.
