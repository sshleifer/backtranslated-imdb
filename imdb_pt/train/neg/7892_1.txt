It started with an interesting premise. I've always liked Civil War stuff and old secret societies. The more the movie progressed, the more I realized that this was a B movie at best. In the second half, it quickly became a movie C, then D, then F, then "I wish it was not a location so I could put it in the microwave!" I can not say that the acting in all cases was horrible, just more. The writing, however ... I've never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The script was written by a 10 year old. It was ridiculously shallow, the dialogue monotonous and uninteresting, the characters as interesting as a 5-pound sack of fertilizer. I really hated this movie, as did my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with films that promote or support Christianity. This movie did a great disservice to the cause. Terrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I highly recommend Superman 4.
