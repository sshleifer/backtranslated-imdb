I can only assume that the other reviewers of this "movie" are shareholders of the producer, since this was possibly the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. From the opening shot of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this movie would kill to be considered "B-Level." My wife and I were in great mood before we started the movie, and we were genuinely eager to see a funny popcorn movie. We knew we had not rented Citizen Kane and we had not expected to see the most incredible movie ever. However, after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully bland piece of junk I have ever seen, we shut it down rather than lose another few minutes of our lives. <br /> <br /> If a "comedy" without laughter, terrible acting, fine plot and annoying characters are your thing, then this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I can not justify writing a longer review of this photo because I've already wasted almost an hour trying to find a joke.
