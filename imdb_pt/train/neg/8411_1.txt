We were expecting something great when we went to see this bomb. It's basically a Broadway piece put into the movie. The music is just terrible. There is no memorable song in the movie - did you hear any hits from this movie? You do not go because there are none. Some of the musical numbers last so long that I got up to go to the bathroom and get some popcorn and I was still going when I came back! If they were good songs well - but they are bad. The pace is slow, the development of the character terrible. The lead was praised for her singing, but it seemed she was screaming all the songs - it was almost impossible to get up. This movie has nothing to offer anyone but Broadway enthusiasts. This is undoubtedly the most voted movie I have ever seen in my entire life. A complete waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this movie except Danny Glover - who was not onscreen enough and whose character was not developed enough. Rent the video and you will agree - this film was an expensive, over-produced polished dog.
