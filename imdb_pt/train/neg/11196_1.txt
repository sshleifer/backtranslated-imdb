My friends and I left after 15 minutes, and we were not the first. Then we tried to get our money back. The film direction would not allow that, but they agreed to let us see another movie. The only time it worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. As you can tell, this was not a memorable evening. Probably one of my worst movie nights. The second place has to be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Theft. In conclusion, for the good of humanity, please do not see the Order.
