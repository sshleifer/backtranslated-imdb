"Shinobi" is one of those movies that thinks that the simple act of killing a character automatically brings a sense of seriousness or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the public to really care about dying people, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially aggravated when you have TONS of characters, all die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you can not be bothered to make the characters memorable or friendly anyway, you can at least make the reasons why they die plausible, right? No. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing why they are fighting each other. They kill themselves because the emperor says so. However, even after it becomes obvious that the emperor wants ALL to be dead, they still refuse to abandon their missions meaningless. This is not stubbornness ... this is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Alright, alright! There is no character development, and the plot does not provide a reasonable justification for the fight. At least they die fighting in legal action scenes, right? Again, NO! In fact, many of the fights are not even fights: super ninjas that the film has spent so much time and effort introducing death suddenly (and, in my opinion, awkward). I'm talking about things like: "Lalala, I'm walking and I- * neck is cut *". The end for this character. Not even in the middle of the movie, I threw my hands in frustration with his absurdity.
