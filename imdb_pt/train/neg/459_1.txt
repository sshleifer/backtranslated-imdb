I was looking for a cute and simple comedy to pass the time, but choosing this movie proved to be a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> I can not write a single good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not funny, relying on recycled and tired jokes and a tortoise farting to laugh. In my book, that's not funny, that's pathetic. <br /> <br /> "Low budget" effects (if I may call them effects) with horrible cinematography. In many places it looks like an indie movie with no money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sorry for the actors. Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards are desperate for some money with which they agreed to participate? (Looking at her recent filmography, it seems so.) Despite the clothes, Pamela is showing her age and as a whole, they do not even look funny, much less funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is not even in the bad category is funny. It's bad, as if everyone involved was tired of it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
