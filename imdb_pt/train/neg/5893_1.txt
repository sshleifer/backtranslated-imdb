This movie was fantastic great movie all scary as hell. and I mean it scared me as much as the pulse and IT and the omen etc. but with a great movie comes crap ending right? RIGHT! this movie finale was a pathetic thing. I mean, a ghost has gone back in time to a chick house and now thinks I did it means I can call her and it's going to be the right time because she thinks she is. right? wrong. my butt! I do not care if the ghost is Satan, it just does not happen. It's a yes movie, but most of the evil movies or films praised like this are meant to make sense, but it did not. it just showed us what I just said and people do not find any of it. Can anyone tell me why you did not notice this pathetic part? The movie for me ended up in the hospital and that's all. check number 3 is much more butt
