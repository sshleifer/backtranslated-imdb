I saw this move several years ago at the Florida Central Festival, if I remember correctly. I liked it, it showed great potential. I think most people here are blowing this movie because the movie seemed to be hobbling (by the director's own admission to the official site - the short was shown as a "rough cut"). <br /> <br /> But however, it was an easy comedy. I think a lot of people try to read a lot in a comedy. All they have to do is make you laugh - that's all. I did just that on your display, so you were successful at that level. Just my 2 cents anyway.
