I just watched Blazing Saddles' 30th anniversary edition, one of my all time favorites !! Black Bart's TV pilot was stinking. The plot was non-existent and the performance was not good. It was obviously an attempt to cash in on the success of Blazing Saddles and there were TV shows that managed to take off great movies, but this one would never have worked. Considering that for so many years the TV did not even play the fart noises when they broadcast the movie, it's inconceivable that they thought they could do a TV show with the word "N" thrown around. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing many familiar faces !!! There were a few actors / actresses that I recognized from other shows over the years. I had to write down all the names and do some searching. It was fun. I was arguing with my mother whether Steve Landesberg was Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
