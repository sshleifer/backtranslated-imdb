First of all, I'm not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema because the usual pattern of creating box office success is tapping below the waist. This film is nothing of an artistic work of art that deals with taboos, as the director and the marketing announcements imply. In my opinion, the only purpose of this film is to make money by touching a sensitive moral (it is actually considered a taboo in the home country). Cheap populism can provide a brief definition of what I meant. <br /> However, the acting is almost perfect. In fact, most of the cast has theatrical training and worked hard to make up for what Altioklar did not have; talent! All cast members were perfectly fit and well-qualified for the job, even the less experienced. (Like Janset) At least Altioklar deserves a little word of thanks, just because he knows how to choose the cast. Other than that, he is just a media ape, who assumes a director with artistic talent. Come on, art is not just about dealing with naked / semi-naked women. And just because the media are proud, no director becomes a landmark in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and something real artistic, I am eagerly waiting to applaud your next job. I hope this time you can achieve an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In summary; Pros> Good acting, hot women (joking!) :) Cons> Each and every one of them, besides the cast
