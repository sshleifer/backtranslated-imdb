I read the book Celestine Prophecy and was eager to see the movie. Be aware that the movie is based on the book. Many of the book's most interesting points do not even appear in the film. It's a "B" movie at best. Many events, characters, how the character interacts and is found in the book are simply altered or do not occur. The flow of events that in the book are very smooth, are agitated and fed to the vision as if you were a child. Character development is very poor. The characters' personalities differ from those in the book. The direction is similar to a horror movie "B". I understand that it would take six hours in the movie to present everything in the book, but the playback base of the screen has lost many points. The cast was very good.
