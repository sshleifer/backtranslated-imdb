This movie should never have been made. <br /> <br /> What a shame about the budget. <br /> <br /> Please hire convincing actors and make an appropriate film. Very thin webbing and unconvincing lines. Almost hilarious, and that's a shame for an action movie ... <br /> <br /> It's definitely not worth watching. <br /> <br /> They keep repeating the same "shots" of a Stealth plane flying away. You've seen it, and it was not worth re-running 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire from the movies. <br /> <br /> Your movies are getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were already bad, but this movie is even worse.
