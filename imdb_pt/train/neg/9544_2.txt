I did not like this movie. I thought the acting was not very good and the story was boring. A 20-year-old computer saving the day? I thought this was just a little improbable, even for a movie. I could not figure out why they could not just turn it off, why not get a sledgehammer for him? <br /> <br /> It's a shame, but after the original 80's movie you expected a lot more than what was actually delivered. This movie could have been a 21st century version of the old movie, it was not. If this is what you want to watch, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer had not appeared to save the day, it would still be, in my opinion, a very tacky movie.
