The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab blast (by them too) where his face is marked by acid. Years later, all the idiots are invited back to school (since closed) for a meeting. What they did not know is that Marty is inviting them to kill them. Then a storm starts, they're locked up at school and Marty starts getting his revenge. Very silly. The murders are inventive and bloody and there are some scary atmospheric shots from the deserted school - but that's about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he is naked, has his head soaked in a toilet and is burned) and is uncomfortable to watch. Considering that Scuddamore committed suicide soon after this was released, it is almost impossible to see it. Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. There is full frontal of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but a girl decides to take a shower alone ... After they know that a killer is wandering after them! And then there's the couple that has to have sex. This is the kind of movie in which the killer seems to know where everyone will be and can teleport to them. It ends with a twist that made me moan and roll my eyes, then another twist that made me want to throw something heavy on the TV! The acting is bearable - not good but bearable. Caroline Munro is in this too. She is a very beautiful woman, but not much of an actress. <br /> <br /> This earns a 3 for some effectively bloody murders and atmosphere. Otherwise it runs from the mill and forgettable. The tragic suicide of Scuddamore has given this film more attention than it deserves.
