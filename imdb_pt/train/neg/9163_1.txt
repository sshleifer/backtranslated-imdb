The Leap Years brings some bigwigs to the local and regional film and television scene. And yet, they can not save this movie. There are so many things going against it - about acting, overly melodramatic, poor script, inconsistent direction; and very few things for that - decent music, good cinematography. This review is mainly for anyone who plays all the local movies in a basket after watching this movie and says that all the local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest based on this movie. This is a television novel disguised as a romantic movie. My hopes were high when I bought my ticket and my hopes were thwarted five minutes into the movie.
