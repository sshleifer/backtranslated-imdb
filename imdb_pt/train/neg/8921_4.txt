The premise of an African-American Scrooge woman in modern and troubled city was inspired, but nothing more is in this film. Here, Mrs. Scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the largely poor and black neighborhood employees and customers he lives in. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not translate well into the urban setting of this film, and the script can not make the update work. In addition, the constant message about sharing and donation is repeated so endlessly, the public gets tired of it well before the movie reaches its family end. This is a message movie that does not know when to leave. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson offers overly tense performance and sometimes the lines are hard to understand. The novel by Charles Dickens has been adapted so many times, it is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, despite its very relevant message.
