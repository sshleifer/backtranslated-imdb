Carl Panzram lived an incredible life and wrote his memoirs on pieces of paper to possibly the only person who did something disinterested for him. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which came out of the better part of a century after Panzram's death, gives the historical context to the account of a first generation of running away from home go west and be a cowboy, get caught, thrown into the boy's house, run away repeatedly and be thrown into prison all the time being tortured and sodomized. As Panzram grew huge and strong, he sought revenge for the evil done to him as he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and no matter what the people he raped, stole or murdered because we are all equally useless. <br /> <br /> This movie releases the skinny James Woods as the rough, naughty, son of a bitch Carl Panzram, who in the movie is a "drunken", overly dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film no longer elaborates on this world traveler and prisoner career (such as stealing former President Taft or being released from Oregon prison as long as he has returned his word). In short, I do not think Carl would be very happy.
