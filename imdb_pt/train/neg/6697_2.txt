Crazed Shotgun-incest directed-revenge looking for truck drivers and obsessive control disorder "Dad raped me when I was 12" carrying handcuffs, all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the characters that you will be presented in this complete disgrace of a movie that can be easily viewed on any cable TV station (ie: Skinemax) at 4am on Sunday morning. (And yes, I know it was a whole sentence, but without people with me; this is a long-winded review for a short, meaningless movie.) Filmed in "somewhere" in Canada with almost no budget, the plot for this show is banal, police have obviously never heard of "State jurisdiction" because they end up chasing both Miya (Hookers) and Trent (idiot, reclusive anal , generic, insecure college student) all over the US (and I thought only the FBI could do that). The camera is unstable, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it can actually cause accidental unintentional flashbacks in movies like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> As for the scenes of Skin Go (which is the only reason to even rent this movie, do not even think about buying it), there are two of them. The first is the only one worth watching, but that is the scene of Dominatrix Sex with Kari Salin and ____ (insert unknown actor here, he obviously did nothing else noteworthy) in a disgusting and disgusting motel room, and the outside refrigerant machine that only has blue tonic water). It's all S & M (riding crops, handcuffs, hot wax and underwear licking) and in the end he's left in a motel room, with no money and police waiting outside his door (this will show for you, do not leave one prostitute tie him up in a motel room "in the middle of nowhere." Unfortunately, Kari does not show any skin worth remembering, and this in itself can cause deep traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so that's definitely a hassle in Snicker: I know you probably would not mind if I revealed it to you, but I'm not going, you should spend your hard-earned money for that one. Despite everything, I give 1/5 for the action, a 3/5 for Skin (See the last paragraph) and a 0/0 for the development of characters, performances or intricate twists. Laughing man
