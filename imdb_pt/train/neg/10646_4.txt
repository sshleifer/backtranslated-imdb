Last of Johnny Weissmuller's films Tarzan and a good thing too, as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he has done over a period of 16 years. No mermaid is presented here, either as a beautiful island woman trying to escape the clutches of her people, who worship a god and try to force her to be his bride. She meets Tarzan and Jane, who try to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest, but is not accustomed to his full advantage. Also on hand and worthy of mention is an extremely annoying guitarist / singer who enters the music from time to time. Even the "great" Robert Florey can not help this. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of four)
