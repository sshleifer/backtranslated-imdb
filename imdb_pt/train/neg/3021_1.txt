Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every movie he did after "Crimson Tide" seems to take him one step closer to being the worst nowadays (Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but at least his great , idiotic and distracted epics entertain themselves at some perverse level primarily). And like other exaggerated Hollywood biotics ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," for example) chronicling the life of super-pretentious, over-estimated or superficial figures, given an aura of "mystique" by a thriving society juicy details behind the scenes, "Domino" is a movie that starts with little potential, and traces that infinitesimal amount before the sixty-minute mark. With an already distracted 128-minute runtime, the film seems to be twice as long, and spending time with characters so annoyingly superficial and forgettable (unlike the higher "Rules of Attraction"), Scott's attempts to influence the process with ironic by Domino, the self-conscious dubbing of rich girls only draws attention to the film's lack of awareness of the sledgehammer) becomes an act that only masochists could find pleasurable. The story? Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in a performance of ersatz-badass as shallow as its dazzling appearance) spoiled the crust, is tired of the shallow lifestyle of the rich and famous of Los Angeles and tackles the rude bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar. Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade; Along the way, there are two crosses, shootings, media attention (courtesy of an ironic Christopher Walken, phoning his sleazebag with his trademark) and laughable hints about the novel. Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last longer than a few seconds, increasing the resolution to make the film a nightmarish nightmare that is downright nasty to watch - if Scott gave an opportunity to frame an image, ghost, or twist it somehow, it will; but all this tacky stylistic overload surpasses the little plot, characterization and suspense that the film has (to say nothing by its "entertainment" value). Most characters seem despicable or stereotyped, often both (note the unbearable segment of several minutes in which an African American introduces a new list of racial categorizations into "Jerry Springer"), and I found myself wishing everyone would get the final "crown" of our protagonist's coin to the end. "Domino" is absolute and absolute rubbish - whatever interest Scott intended to inspire in his audience, he is lost in a sea of ​​neon pretensions that induce migraine for a few minutes.
