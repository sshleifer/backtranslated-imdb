What the hell in a D-Movie was that? Bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogues / plots I've ever seen. The cool thing here was Coolio, who had a great appearance as a scared cop. However, the rest of the movie is horrible and annoying. It's not that bad, you can laugh about it. Just plain crap. And whoever compares this with the Evil Dead Series could very well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, okay, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10
