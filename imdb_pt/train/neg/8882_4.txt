Calling a movie about a crippled ghost revenge from beyond the grave and lifeless would be too ironic, but this here is an undeniable combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) via LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); while still watchable in itself, is so clich√©-ridden that it causes laughter instead of the intended cold. However, thanks to the difficulties in the British film industry in the late 1970s, even a mediocre script like this managed to attract 10 star names - Cliff Robertson (as a conniving husband), Jean Simmons (in the Jenny Agutter Robertson's sister-in-law), Simon Ward (as the enigmatic driver), Ron Moody (as a sickly doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons' best friend and wife of Jayston) , Flora Robson (as the maid), David Tomlinson (as the notary read Simmons will) and, surprisingly perhaps, Jack Warner (as a tombstone sculptor) - although most of them have no parts, I'm sorry to say!
