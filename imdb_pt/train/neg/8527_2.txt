There are three movies with this style of animation that I remember fondly from my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicorn", "Flight of the Dragons" and "The Hobbit". I own copies of both "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and I had not seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. That was until today and now I wish I had not. What annoyed me the most was the script. It was incredibly unstable and often tasteless. Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation. Nor are we just talking about little things here; we are talking about key points of the plot! The story itself is not so good to begin with, but it could have worked if the script was decent. Not even close. Also, the music was horrible! I know that music in movies like these rarely has what one might call classical pieces, but the music in that film made me want to be knocked unconscious by a bowling ball. This was one of those movies that I was going to show my kids someday, but it just got cut. I do not think I could sit down with that party again. Disappointed is to put the minimum.
