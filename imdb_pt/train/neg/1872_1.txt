BE WARNED. This movie is a mess. It's a catastrophe. Do not waste your time on this one. I warned you! <br /> <br /> The acting, history, dialogue, music ... basically everything is so exaggerated, it is absolutely boring and ridiculous. It made me want to vomit (if the dialogue / acting / story was not doing it, everyone is being crooked). You will feel like you are watching a comedy. The problem is that the supposedly funny parts are not even funny. The acting, the history, the cinematography, you can feel that everything is just trying very well WAAAAY - but never works. Virtually every shot is tilted, but so what? This movie looks like a student movie. No wonder they recorded it in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money filming this in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have fun easily or like to act badly, write, edit, direct, full of clich√©s, everything that is forced on your face, oh and did I mention bad acting? (well, actually, it's not all the actor's fault - it's the director!) so I think you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this for a class. I would have hung up immediately if I could. If you still can not say so far, I hated this movie. It made me want to vomit and have my time back ... at least I did not have to pay for that garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day, is in this movie, but he sure dropped down from then on - accepting film roles like this catastrophe.
