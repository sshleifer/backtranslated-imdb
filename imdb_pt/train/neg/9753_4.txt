I am grateful for one thing and one thing - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away in a completely different continent !!! Yay !!! This program summed up perfectly how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with prostitution of herself and her family to the media in the name of self-promotion and the "Beckham brand". Some years ago I used to like 'Posh and Becks', I still admire David's talent a lot, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has his wife's hand pushing his ass, working like a puppet? <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was in all of Beckham's premature departure for Manchester United and now the same thing happened at Real Madrid. I hope that Beckham can live with the fact that although he may be gaining a lot of pounds, he has sold his soul for Buck Buck and will end his days playing for a team that would fight to win the promotion of the first division in England (no offense in America) . - but in baseball and basketball you dominate - football, you do not!) <br /> <br /> Anyway - I disagree. It's been years since I've seen such a false and completely false performance of 'Posh' - being this one headed only during their red carpet-worthy performances after the disaster of Rebecca Loos, when instead of playing all the cr * P David he deserved, she desperately grabbed his arm trying to save the million pounds in cash that her marriage had become. <br /> <br /> All this public relations tricks were pathetic. Why can not she simply go there in silence, support her husband with the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep his head down? When did she become so full of importance that she feels that the move to America should be shrouded by this great fame? <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw the documentary David Beckham last night. At least he retained a splinter of grace and humility. Two things your wife could do with learning. <br /> <br /> One more thing, Victoria - you complain about being constantly chased by the paparazzi. Little hint - stop warning them about your location, you stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good luck, America !!
