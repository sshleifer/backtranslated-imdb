After seeing the poster of the movie Smother, I knew I was about to experience one of those intolerable cinematic experiences that make me want to take my eyes out. However, I felt a slight optimism because the film had a solid cast that I thought was going to rescue the film. Unfortunately this did not happen. Mother is a horrible movie, but it is not execrable. This is the best I can say about it . Smother's script (written by the same guys from License to Wed, something that explains they have anything but talent for writing movies) are full of cheap and predictable humor.Seriously, I do not In addition, the solid cast that I mentioned earlier is absolutely. After the sheer number of junk she's been involved in (such as the monumentally heinous and execrable Because I Said So), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career is dying out. However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances. she has brought in previous decades in films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom.On Smother, she does her best effort with her performance but her character is so horribly written that she can not do anything about it. Dax Shepard left me a good impression with his solid performances in the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy.However, he does what he can with his character.Mike White also makes a good effort but he does not get very far.He is a screenwriter very talented (as he showed in films such as The Good Girl and School of Rock), so I would have liked to see that he was one of the writers of this film instead of just acting on it.Liv Tyler suffers the same situation from all actors mentioned earlier: to be wasted Smother's worst failure is to be absolutely annoying and bland. His script is nothing more than a collection of scenes and forced situations that we saw on sitcom. Stay away from this low quality comedy.
