I can not believe I missed 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible movie I kept hoping it would get better by the end but the boy was wrong. The plot was abysmal, the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were terrible. Not even the two pretty girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However I can not lie, some of the lines in this movie were quite memorable, like when the Asian boy says "I lost my virginity with the nanny, so f **** stereotypes" <br /> <br /> Please , do not waste your time on this accident unless you're prepared or want to have a good laugh ... maybe that way you can watch it to rip this movie with some friends
