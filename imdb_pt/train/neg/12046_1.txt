I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The film was directed so poorly that it made my stomach ache. The pace was so slow, the dialogue laughable and the film - well beyond a good fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was superficial. <br /> <br /> And why, oh why Hollywood always insists on rewriting stories to fit "consumer approval." Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OFF the walls of Troy with an arrow at his ankle! It bothers me that such a classic story is turned into soap. <br /> <br /> And do not even start the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was fought on, and it did not even seem like they cared much for each other. No sparks, no emotion, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say that in defending the films Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole acted very well with a bad script but that is not enough to save this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the 200 million pound budget went? Maybe in all the trees they used for funeral pyres - where did they get all those trees? <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed it hurts.
