Oh, come on, people give the movie some time. The only thing I liked was ......... Sorry, still thinking. Oh yeah!!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys. Oh, sorry, wrong movie, I was thinking of a better quality movie. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend you. Oh yeah, the girl who was Clueless's was in it. Do not put down Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you made a doooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, something that was never done in a western cast, even female, they actually hung a woman from the gallows. This can be a Western first. Even if her neck has been broken and she has survived the ordeal, you still have to give the director some effort to try a Westerner. Also, I've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western, although this has not happened in this movie, I just thought of giving the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be made shortly after Ed Wood's Bride of the # 2 monster. Maybe that's what the makers of this movie were looking for. Orginality, especially with an all-African woman and an eastern cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if the creators of Gang of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess, you might have a slang like, "Hey, you do not care about my homegirls," and " baby. "You can also have a surrogate surrogate type marshal who says things like," That shooting was TOTALLY RAD, totally. " You know things like that.
