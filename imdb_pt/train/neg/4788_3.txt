In the third installment of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to chase the Tall Man, assisted by a 9-year-old boy, a G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike's late brother (he died in the original Phantasma). The number 3 is a rather disappointing sequence as the gore and black comedy is far less inspiring and exciting than Phantasm II. I had the feeling that the stress was only on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a comedian. The mood of the previous film was much more dry and overwhelmed, which fits best in a story like that. Also, the settings are not so macabre here, besides the constant presence of the Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious? There's still a lot of blood, but it's not so good this time. By the way, beware of the severely cropped version as it shows more delicious kills off the screen. The entire Phantasm series is the achievement of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed 4 episodes so far - the fifth in production. The first is a semi-cult classic, the second is a feast of terror and violence and the rest can be easily ignored. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros portrays his much better character in Phantasm II.
