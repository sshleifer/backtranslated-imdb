DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie that was shown continuously on Sky Movies in Britain and considering that it appeared to be running about three times a week for a whole year, I have absolutely no idea how I managed to lose until it was broadcast for the first time on the network. tonight. In fact, seeing that I'm not much fan of horror movies, the reason probably was my theory that this would be silly. My theory was proven most of the time <br /> <br /> !!!!! SPOILERS MINOR !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of stupid scripts involved. For example, at the beginning of the movie, the bad guys are flying Dracula's coffin from London to America (on a twin engine turboplane!) And one of the bad guys is left alone in the cargo compartment where Dracula comes to life. A fight erupts, there is a lot of noise, but the bad guys in the cockpit do not hear a sound until the script demands. It also seems at the climax of this segment that Dracula can control the weather, but this seems forgotten as the film progresses. Sloppy scripting, and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there are numerous scenes of characters being in the New Orleans carnival, then the characters are in a different location such as police station in the next scene, so they are back in the mardi gras the scene after that, which means that the lack of credibility in the plot is reinforced <br /> <br /> There is something else that ripped off my chain - product placement. There are many scenes where the logo of a certain record label / retailer is in sight. I dare not divulge the company's brand (except to say that they also run a train company which is a national joke in Britain), but I got the impression that this kind of advertising was against British guidelines and I'm surprised the BBC. this movie if that is the case <br /> <br /> There are some good points in DRACULA 2000 like the visuals for example. This is actually a beautiful movie with a good cast and the boy was a tasty vampire, but it's something we should expect from Hollywood in the last few years - a very beautiful film that is very dumb
