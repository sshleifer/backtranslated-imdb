With this cast and budget you will expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has made a number of films that border on the stranger, but it still works. Neither he, nor his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this farce of banal trash badly written. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing more than a series of visual jokes and worse. The plot goes nowhere, writing is invented, pointless and the characters thin. If you think of a movie as three-dimensional, where the story and the characters bring a depth to the image, this stink is as flat as the mickey of the steamboat. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Dan Akroyd brings back memories of another truly horrible movie, nothing from 1991 except problems. Frankly this movie is the kind of project that kills careers and gets laid off agents.
