Oh my God. I bought this movie and ... I ... watched ... the ... every ... thing. . . All right, it's going to be all right ... I know I'll be fine in a month or two. Some time later, I hope to get rid of the flashbacks. I was going to eat something after the movie, but I can not find the courage to try to hold any food at the moment. Bad? Yes, ill. Very bad. Bad Bad Bad Bad. Wait, poor does not seem to convey the message in the right way. Hmm ... There is not a word to describe how horrible ... it is not horrible ... Hmm creepy horrifying / interpreted / acted / filmed / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do, but throw it away. Possibly to burn him I would not want him to end up in the bottom of an architectural excavation a thousand years from now. The worst movie since "Hey Happy"
