I really did not like this movie because it did not really bring the messages and ideas that L'Engle brought in his novel. We had read the novel in our English class and I absolutely loved it, I'm afraid I can not say the same for the film. There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and simply made no credit to the imaginative genius who is Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason why I gave such a bad note. Do not watch this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle texts because you will be very disappointed. However, if you're watching the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational, as was my case) then it's a right movie!
