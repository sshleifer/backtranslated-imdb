1) I am not an expert on weapons, but even I can see the difference between the US Army riffles in World War I and World War II. In the film we can see privates, armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in the year 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (also known as "Silent Death"), which uses privates until World War II. Difference - M1 can carry 1.5 times more ammo and 3 times more fire rate! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires recharging after every shot. Not much difference ?! 2) The uniforms of the German army were borrowed from the year 1940 as well. Especially - helmets. German helmets until the end of World War I have a significant pique at the top, we can not see even one in the film. And if we do little further research on the archives - how much truth is this "true story"? It amazes me how "true" can be film director in search of cheap spreading.
