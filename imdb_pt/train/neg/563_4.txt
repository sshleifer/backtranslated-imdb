Should all good stories be "enhanced" with fussy Broadway songs? Apparently, those who fail to create their own plots think that classical literature is there only for plunder. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorite, as it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that made him pretty upset, and this was a great example of this ... So of course, take this serious tale. and add nauseating music and camp with all the characters of orphaned boys bobbing miners bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Bring me a basin. <br /> <br /> The four stars in my assessment come from the casting, which I could compare to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films has a cast that a play version can be proud of, but they should go and have it sing (see the complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those who sing here could really do it and they mercifully spared us the voice of Oliver Reed (sorry if I've been wrong for some time). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is' ve stated. Why embarrass everyone but the really shameless, putting silly songs in a perfectly good story? Rarely has this been done with good results. Usually that ruins the story. He did with this. The jury still does not know if this story is worth saving, but with all that noise, it's impossible to say.
