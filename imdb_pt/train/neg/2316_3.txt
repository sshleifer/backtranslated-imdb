Having read for many years how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the French critics (especially the snobby crowd of Cahiers), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it very disappointing (but then I think my expectations were very high). Filmed in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV and fortunately only an hour) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they reflect on a series of paintings . (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find out if they contain some clues about a hidden political crime. (Kate Beckinsale's awful film, "Uncovered," has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say that almost any story of Borges is more interesting than this movie.
