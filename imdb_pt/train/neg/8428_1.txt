Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating, this is a horrible movie. Quite terrible, I feel compelled to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film is set in the final period of the Raj, during India's struggle for independence. What follows in the ridiculous plot fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist at that time. For example, young married to the Hindu maid in the local village have an affair with their married English teacher, knowing full well that the discovery of the case would probably mean total social ostracism and shame, if not a deadly punishment. ? Unlikely, but maybe still. However, the same young Hindu maid, in the conservative Indian society of the day, would continue as a naked Britney Spears in heat, participating in hot outdoor sex during the day in open sight, where they could be discovered at any time? This is not just bloody unlikely, which is a retarded plot. Such idiocy combined with poor acting led me to leave the cinema for an hour in the movie, so I did not watch the second half of the movie. You can only expect the end to be smarter than what I saw in the first half.
