I bought this gloriously glorious free movie, over the top, fun bloodbath. I do not have any of them. This movie flaws on virtually every level, it's neither scary nor funny, it's just a horrible movie, and it never provides the public with anything worth seeing. What is so bad about it is that, far from being as crude, violent, and brutal as it was promised, there is very little violence. Practically no bloodshed and no excitement. Performance, direction and dialogue are absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's truly laughable. I could hardly sit through this total garbage once; I certainly will not want to watch again. Do not waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this; is actually possibly the worst film ever made. If I could give less stars, I would.
