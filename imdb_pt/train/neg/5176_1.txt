When a movie is independent and not rated, like the Hamiltons, I was hoping to get out of the norm, cut off their heart violence. I know good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I've read reviews, I've visited the site, and even convinced some of my friends to pay $ 9.50 to see this horrible movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I'm expecting horror, not Dawsons Creek with incestuous tones. My expectations were extremely low for this movie, but the few expectations for the movie were fired into hell as I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someone's finger. There were many holes in the plot and too much left to the imagination. I regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think there may have been more violence and blood in that movie than in the Hamiltons!
