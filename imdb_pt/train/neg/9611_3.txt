There are so many silly things about this movie that I can not name just a few: <br /> <br /> The character of BOGART: 1. Your name? Whip McCord (very easy, so I'll leave it at that. Boy, does "Humphrey" sounds good.) 2. His long, curly hair and silly chops. 3. Your Black Bart presentation, complete with spurs! 4. I'm not sure of the gloss tone he used, but it's nothing flattering. <br /> <br /> The character of CAGNEY (Jim Kincaid): 1. Your lipstick does you no favors. , or. 2. The man is being swallowed up by the hat throughout the movie! Could not they find a hat for him? Even a little? !!?! 3. Your pants are too tight at the back. 4. He blows the smoke from his gun many times, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. <br /> <br /> If you're a casual fan of Bogart or Cagney, and imagine it could be a change of pace to see them in a western, do yourself a favor and forget that thought. EVEN THE HORSES LOOK BOARDED! (That is, when they do not look bored.) <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I admit that Westerners are my favorite movie genre, but I still saw much, much better than that. On a comedy level, or as a high camp, the Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it is careful viewer. So see this only if a) you should see all the westerners out there b) you are a complete Cagney or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments appeal to you. Woah ?? ..
