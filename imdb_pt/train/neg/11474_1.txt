This relic of a short film begins with a teenager going through the process of trying to get a driver's license. He quickly deviates from all imaginable affairs related to cars. <br /> <br /> Things like dune carts, drag racing, custom painting jobs and trade shows are discussed. He often tries to be humorous, but instead the film is tedious, prolonged and even sexist at times. None of the people in the movie are actually heard. Instead, everything is done in narration and narration. Sorry, but I can not stand it. <br /> <br /> There's nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow the car?" It's just another piece of eels taking its time on the "Wonderful World Of Disney" TV show. 1/10
