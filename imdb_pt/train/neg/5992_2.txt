The most embarrassing moment in this movie is when Brady Corbet says "You Blossomed" near the end of the movie. I practically died. I'm still not sure why the writers put that line there. Should I create romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but a Thunderbird movie had the potential to do so much. This movie does not. If it did not have the big card brand Thunderbirds, it would have been straight to the TV or canned in the post-production. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> Like I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll and they play Busted's song 'Thunderbirds are go'. I can not believe I lost $ 7 watching this through pay-per-view.
