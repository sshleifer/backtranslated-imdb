This movie makes Canadians and Britons are assholes and assholes. Men are stoned / drunk and shout / beat each other in almost every scene. Are women superfluous to history? I do not understand what they are there for? they pass each scene causing tumult, or worse, walking around like hypnotized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either vulgar brawlers or gigantic hippie girls. It's the standard girlfriend, her loser boyfriend and her ridiculous playfulness we've seen in countless movies before. <br /> <br /> Each character here is a charitable and childlike stereotype. Not to mention that everyone seemed to need a shower! And the idea of ​​any kind of scene involving sex with George Wendt? shake ?? is enough to make someone choke! Did I watch the movie because Samuel West was in it? but I can not understand why he would accept such a role. Maybe he needed the money. Ian Tracey is an excellent actor - the only one with a vague moment of ransom, but his talent is wasted here. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the plot? the three fools trying to get their drug back? yawn - or Karl ?? Who is dead, but who really is a very lively character in the minds of those left behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece? Although I'm ashamed to even think of comparing these two films), why bother? Karl is so annoying that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying. <br /> <br /> At the end of this wretched movie, I thought everyone would have been better off going with him on that boat!
