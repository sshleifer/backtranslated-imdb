I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've ever seen. It was ultra-high technology for its time. It could repel enemy fire, do all sorts of stunts in the air and knock down almost anything in its path. Now I come back and watch today and am amazed at how bad this show really is. The cast members are hardly attractive, there are many extravagant moments, and the fighting scenes are incredibly fake. And almost every end has the same crappy helicopter, with the obvious re-use of low-end high-end films. Many of the films seem to date back to the Vietnam War era. Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider except that the chosen crime fighting vehicle is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I was completely bored. I, however, love theme music.
