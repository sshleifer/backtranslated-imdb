I saw that movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who, unfortunately, tries to be Hitler. The movie mind, does not reflect the truth. In the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his gun. Hitler never hit anyone, he did not hit people with the fist, but with the fists of the soldiers. I understand?? Another thing is: it's too obvious that Hitler is so mean, he was smarter than the one shown in this movie. No German would have accepted him as the leader, because he can see that he is evil. So the real Hitler did not show his evil side to people. <br /> <br /> Have any of you Yankees seen the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawn"? this is a great movie with incredible actors. And it's a German movie. I think that this Nazi Germany theme should not be performed as a movie by people who do not know anything about Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad time for humans around of the world.
