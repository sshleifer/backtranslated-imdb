Being that I loved the original "Caligula", even with all its flaws, I have to say that this remake trailer was lousy. <br /> <br /> Listening to Jovovich say in that lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." makes me feel sick. The scenery does not look Roman ... looks like a wealthy Hollywood mansion backyard, and Roman costumes look like a cheap crap you buy at a costume shop in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> That "charming" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Hispanic woman totally terrified, as if she did not know it's a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> The acting has to be one of the worst I've ever seen, with most of the lines I hear being random actors shouting "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" <br /> <br /> Random sex scenes also filled up a good 40 or 50 percent of the trailer, and scenes with notable actors like Gerard Butler (who graces the screen in shadows for three and a half seconds) , doing nothing but looking uncomfortable or going to the top with their minimal lines, just dragging them down with the ridiculousness of their delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's part is that she looks like her typical hooker stuck to a door murmuring over the moon or something. You can not tell because she's drunk or loud or just grumpin 'stupidly. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... laughing randomly, and screaming in such a way that irritates him. <br /> Helen Mirren ... she was in the original, and her return to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I particularly "love" (and out of love, I mean hate) the speech of Ennia, "Caligola ... j00 in the maki me * something incoherent * .... * something that sounds like j00nalo *" It is also insanely arrogant to say the four of Caligula The reign of one year was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this has to be the worst, most exploratory, self-indulgent, and arrogant piece of junk labeled "art" I have ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he should not have appeared or given his name to this crap, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a billion trillion yen). The worst trailer ever.
