A group of people are invited to the high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover that it is a farce from a former schoolmate that they made a near-fatal joke. Now he seeks revenge on all those who hurt him, sealing all exits and cutting off all phone lines. <br /> <br /> Dark horror movie with a rather simple premise. A good level is some good acting, some pretty creative death scenes, lots of excitement and scares, some humor and an original ending. <br /> <br /> No classification for Extreme Violence, Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations, Profanity and Drug Use.
