This is a movie where all the actors are well, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino in a film where each of the three couples finds herself in a situation that seems forced to be cute or put the story in motion. In other words, it looks like planned movie scenes, not like real life. Even though women who work in hairdressing salons go out with one of their clients, this does not seem realistic in the way it is written in this film. Also, when one of the characters encounters the overweight woman in the movie, it seems artificial, the way they look seconds after arguing. Again, the actors are all good, and the moments in this movie are good, but overall another indie who could have used some rewrites before the production began.
