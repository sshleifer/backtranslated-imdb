This was a great idea and the scenery was beautiful, but that's where it ends. It looked like a dull Set It Off that meets The West. The plot barely made any sense. There were so many characters and there was not enough time to develop their personalities. There were also unnecessary things happening that did not belong to the plot or helped to advance the story. There were also long blank moments in which the plot could have been explored, but used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense, just like the direction. I had a huge question mark in my head watching this movie. But the cast was great in my opinion. If you are just watching for eye candy, then this is the movie for you.
