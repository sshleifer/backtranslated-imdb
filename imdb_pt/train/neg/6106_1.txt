This was just awful, the plot was just OK, but the rest of the was was bad. I mean, come on the puppet and they even tried to make the digital movie and that made it even worse! I usually like low budget movies, but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the device he had received. I have about ten low budget movies with about 6-8 movies and I have to say that this is the worst movie of them all. Also the text is out and they use a fake plastic machetes that do not even look real, they could use one that looked even close to a real one to save your time and money and I do not watch this horrible movie.
