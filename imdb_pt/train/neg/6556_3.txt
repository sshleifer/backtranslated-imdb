I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week. <br /> <br /> It's a fairly fun piece containing two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the most interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short and unsatisfactory relationships. She literally stumbles on Brian Kerwin (a guy regularly married to Kids) after driving his car on his back. After initially being hostile to each other, he offers to take her home, since she does not feel more comfortable to drive. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife discovers. Which happens in the end for which I was not prepared, but the slow pace and the routine direction of the TV takes away any drama from the plot. <br /> <br /> The other section involves a former studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section really has the best cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss, but in the end, when he is asked to resign, they all realize that their careers are now going nowhere. <br /> <br /> Time goes by, but it's not that interesting, and I'm glad it was not bought for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but she was admittedly the only actor who deserved to be seen in this movie and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Overall though, unless you are a fan of her avoid this, as it is very routine.
