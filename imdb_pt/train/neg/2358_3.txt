In the future of 2001, Freddy is after the last surviving teenager from Elm Street. Abandoning ANY threat to unfortunate attempts at humor and unnecessary celebrity appearances (come on .. Roseanne ??? Tom Arnold ?? !! ?? WTF ??), this is tied with part 2 is the worst that the rapist demon has ever received . Wow, that was crap. Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could do away with the stench of this film. And when the hell did Freddy ever have a daughter? The entire film is severely retarded in form, shape and form conceivable. Rachel Talalay, you stink of the sky, my dear. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Crew Cast and Biographies; Go to the 3D sequence and jump to a nightmare options (more extras for the movie can be found on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set) DVD-Rom Content: Trivia Game; Script; and web link
