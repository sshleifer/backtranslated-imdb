I chose this movie on the cover alone thinking that I was on an adventure level of "Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom". Unfortunately I was in a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn I've had before. This yawn was so big that I could barely find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described incredible special effects. There were none. The film was so light that even the stereotypes were terribly portrayed. This gives you the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach this to your kids. I do not. Stay away from that. If you are looking for family entertainment then you can find something that is more inspiring somewhere else.
