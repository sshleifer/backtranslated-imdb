The performance was not great, the story was full of simplistic curves and transparent characters. It is about the repercussions of the struggle between the right wing voters of the Flemish bloc on one side and the Moroccan people living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of history of the Belgian West Side or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to answer both questions (assuming these were the director's questions as well). Still, some of the scenes could work as a sort of film by Ken Loach, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extreme right-wing party of the Flemish bloc and is struggling with many problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It is very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this is not successful, unfortunately. Still, he is telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign spectators who watch should try to appreciate it and realize that it is not the film that is important, but the social lines that surround it and that haunt Belgium, a country of 10 million inhabitants, in the 2000s.
