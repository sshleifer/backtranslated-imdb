I really love the sexy action and science fiction movies of the sixties and it's because of the actress who appeared in them. They found the sexiest women in these movies and it did not matter if they could act (Remember "Candy"?). The reason I was disappointed with this movie was because it was not nostalgic enough. The story here has a science fiction movie called "Dragonfly" being made and the director is fired. So the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) complete the scene. They are a real pretty woman in the movie that plays Dragonfly, but she's barely in it. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, who uses some of his father's adventures from his earliest days and places them in the script. I wish the film could be a tribute to the first films. They could have many appearances of actors appearing on them. There is an actor in this movie that was popular from the sixties and his Law John Phillip (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell also appear. I think I'm going to have to keep waiting for a director to do a good tribute to the movies of the sixties. If anyone is reading this, "Make it as sexy as possible"! I'll be waiting!
