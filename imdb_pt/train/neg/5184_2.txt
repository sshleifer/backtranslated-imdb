I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but I was disappointed on many levels. First, the story is so badly recycled that it makes it almost unbearable. Second, the setting, performance and story are not very authentic or believable. Third, there are many more good black actors to choose from than these standard choices. How about some originality? Third, there were very few Hip Hop songs played in full - if any. None really seems central. Overall, the movie was a big disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the movie worth it.
