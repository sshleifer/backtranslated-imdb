The opening scene "explains" why Hurt is later "immune" to "Contaminated Man". Too bad it does not explain anything else: how did he get whatever he 'got' / what was / why does it work so fast? Then we go to "Present Day Budapest". Okay, was it opening in the past or in the future? It turns out it's the past, of course, but for a minute it seems so likely that the movie moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid more attention, right? Or maybe it's just done poorly. So much confusion about the different jobs he had in related fields and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment he did on it. Aha! So did private industry and industry come together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects? He must have been one of the best guys, he's a friend of the chem company club, for Christ's sake. Then there is the substance itself: Technically, a poison, but it becomes immune carriers, so that we can have what we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How convenient. Then there is the protocol h a z m a t: They enter into a situation without having any idea of ​​what is reserved, or how to prepare for it. Did not the producers have enough money to show a proper wash after the team just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance? I kept thinking that Hurt would die of a poor cleaning technique, and the open scene would end up being the closest after all.
