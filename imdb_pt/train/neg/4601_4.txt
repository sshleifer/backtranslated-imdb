I do not know anything about the previous work of the writer or the director, so I did not bring any prejudice to the film. Based on the brief description of the plot in the TV Guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But implausibility was fraught with implausibility. Each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag more bloodshed, horrible makeup or special effects. <br /> <br /> The result was professional and Kari Wuhrer looks like a decent actress, but the rest was more than disappointing. . It was positively repulsive. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the whims of the narrative, but I will give an example of what I consider an excess of explicit blood. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated farmhouse and pulls the frozen body of his previous victim (Wendt) out of deep freezing. McKenna killed Wendt by biting a piece of his neck. Now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's death. (What will the police do, measure their bite radius?) McKenna unwraps Wendt's head and neck from the freezing bag, picks up an ax, and begins to cut off Wendt's head. Whack Whack Whack The tip of the ax continues to cut through Wendt's neck. The air is filled with nuggets of frozen meat, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (He steps away when he finishes.) McKenna then leads the frozen head to a small fire he built. He sits down on the floor, crouches beside her, takes some pictures of a woman he has just killed, and shows them to Wendt's head. "Remember her? We could have really succeeded if it were not for you," he says to the head. "Duke, you always liked bonfires, did not you?" he asks. Then he puts his head in the fire. We only have a glimpse of it burning, but we can hear the crackling fat in the flame. <br /> <br /> I do not want this kind of trash to be censored. I'm just wondering who likes to see these things. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue with the rest of the film. Well, let me mention an example of an "implausibility" since I brought the idea. McKenna was kidnapped and locked in a dark, bare shack. He knows he will be beaten to death in the days to come. (He literally invited the heavyweights to do this.) What would you do in this poe-like situation? Here's what McKenna does in what could be the last night of his life. He finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl and masturbates (successfully). Give that man the Medal of Freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster that looks like Pizza the Hut is played in some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is usually handheld and oscillating. The dialog box has lines like "Life is a piece of s ***. Or it is the best of all possible worlds. It depends on your point of view." The use is made of a wide-angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. A house explodes in an explosive fireball at the end, while the hero, McKenna, walks toward us in the foreground. <br /> <br /> He is also a hero. He first kills a man for $ 13,000 banging on his head several times with a heavy statue, then a potted plant, before finally knocking over a refrigerator over the body. (That bothers him a little, but not enough to stop him from insisting on payment.) So, I expect to have the right order, he kills Wendt by tearing part of his neck. So he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavy on her, though by almost any moral calculation they had nothing to do with it. Then he burns the head (Baldwin) alive. Then, having disabled the two minors, he deliberately explodes them, although one of them is not entirely unfriendly. And we should be cheering for McKenna. <br /> <br /> These are not cartoon deaths like those in the Dirty Harry movies - bang bang and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first - the $ 13,000 murder - is made awkwardly to resemble what might happen in real life. It is not really easy to kill another human being, as Hitchcock demonstrated in Torn Curtain. But this scene leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> Some people may like this, especially the young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in the movies. Some fictional things on the screen here.
