1a watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): typical Mary Kate & Ashley with a few more kisses. It seems to me that the girls are getting very tired of these things and it will be interesting what happens to them if they decide to separate and follow the same paths. In this episode of their adventures, they are trainees in Rome for a fashion designer who puts them directly in the matching room to learn what it is to work hard (I think ...). In addition to the typical flirtations with the boys, there is not much beyond the Roman scenery until about into the way to the movie, when it is finally revealed why they are being fired, then re-hired, then fired again and then re-hired again. This is definitely done by people who do not understand the corporate world and this shows in their interpretation of it. Maybe the real world is their next adventure (if there is one). Even my children did not seem to care about this boring "adventure". Let's see that they will probably only have a few years until their legal adults. Let's see what happens then.
