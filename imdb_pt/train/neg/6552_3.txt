Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie) wandered through a post-apocalyptic wasteland (after her protector died of old age, said the protector was played by a decent actor Elias Koteas) and now she discovers that people wander the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap and money. She leads a group of burned cyborgs (which includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 can be better than the other two entries, but it's still a rather monotonous feature. The problem this time is that ideas with potential are never well used, action sequences are routine and names like McDowell, Katt and Galligan have little to do. Haje is indeed a whining heroine and Lynch is very exaggerated (as usual) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as entertaining as the hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second is just bored.) Also, the angle of science fiction that almost resists aggressively against any good idea is disappointing. As an action movie, this is routine and by the material numbers of movie B and it is done competently, that's the only positive thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (Poor)
