While Leon is cute in SNL, he is only for a minute. Like most SNL movie skits, it can not fill 90 minutes. There are some cute moments (the ones you saw in the trailer), but the actors are largely wasted. Tim Meadows does his best, but the plot does not have many high points. Will Farrell has a small part. Farrell may be the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie. What a pity.
