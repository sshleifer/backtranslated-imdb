If an author gets 2 credits before the main title and about 15 credits before the movie starts, and the first scene shows the author rolling in a bed with lycra shorts, it will not be surprising to note that the author has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex. The kind of appearance that may be helpful to a homosexual aversion therapist. <br /> <br /> Others have given this thing what it deserves. For me, the most pitiful moment came when the LA trip was represented by an airplane landing in what looked like LAX; and the return was represented by a shot of a cargo plane from FedEx.
