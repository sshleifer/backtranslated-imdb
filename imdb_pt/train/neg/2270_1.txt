The only thing that stopped me from vomiting after watching this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the horrors show that usually shows up on the TV show. This is also the main reason why TV show fans will not like the movie, but not the only reason. This movie has as much entertainment value as getting a root canal. He approaches the abysmal depths of bad movie making and gets even worse. I will not waste your time describing this movie in more detail; suffice it to say that I pity the poor cameras who had to suffer by watching this c ** p for the first time.
