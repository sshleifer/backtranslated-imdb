The quality of the video is horrible. The sound quality is pathetic. The acting is horrible. Dialogue is painful. The lighting is dark. The issue is laughable. I could go on, but it would be useless. Snitch'd is a third amateur video being passed as a feature film. This is best left to collect dust in the video store bin.
