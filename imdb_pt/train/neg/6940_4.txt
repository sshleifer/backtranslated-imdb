When you have two artists towers against each other, the least you can hope for is superb camaraderie and this is the case in this movie where we have a young 64, Amitabh Bachchan celebrates a 34-year-old taboo. Wait! In fact, this is all there in the name of the plot, so instead of "cheeni", it is the content that is "Kum" in this Adman, which became the first effort of director-writer R. Balki. <br /> <br /> Two senior actors to bring down the house with their wise cracks and bitter moments when love happened in this unconventional pair, and that's all you find in the slow but refreshing first half. The London sites captured in the rainy season are captivating. By the end of the first half, romance finished and mission accomplished. There is not much to be said. So in the second half, a strange opposition comes in the form of a girl's father, as far as he goes to a Satyagrah is really a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax about how it gives way. The result, the second half is dry, flat and without energy. There is a subplot with a girl dying of cancer, without causing much impact. However, the film is recommended for its new approach and performances.
