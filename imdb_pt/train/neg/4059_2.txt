Rarely has such an incredible cast been so wasted. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro all jumped on board, only to be torpedoed by a script that looks like nothing more than a Hollywood joke. Attaching Martin Scorsese's name to this was probably the draw, but the end result is much smaller than the sum of its parts. Resembling a terribly wrong nightmare, each scene seems more artificial than the next. "Search and Destroy" is nothing more than an absurd abstract, elegant and self-indulgent, and the whole film is decidedly monotonous .......... MERK
