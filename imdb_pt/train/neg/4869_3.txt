This film failed to exploit the humanity of the animals that left me with an empty feeling inside. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to give up the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. While Babe (the original) resisted the trend of big budget successes, focusing on the human virtues of animals versus their human counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comic cartoons that one could willingly fill with flesh . grinder (even more so if one could understand their meaningless babbling). Without the crazy behavior of Eddie Murphy, this movie would be a failure.
