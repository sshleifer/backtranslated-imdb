Mark Hamill should have felt ashamed of CORVETTE SUMMER! This time he uses a new kind of "force" to regain possession of his dream machine, a bright red Vette. It looks like another sour teen movie in the first half hour and does a reversal in the wrong direction. The writing and directing jobs are terribly done, with some scenes you can hardly handle. You're hoping for that to happen anyway, and you're also sniffing the scent of miscellaneous from the late 70's. Only an ex-rookie like Annie Potts would easily steal the program and save that poor movie from the repository! Her impractical but delicious personality maintains her interest in good, and this is the best chance to see her in a bathing suit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry, Mark! I think the Force was not with you this time.
