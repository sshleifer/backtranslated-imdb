My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy who lives in the same town as the screenwriter of this movie. We were very upset that the JCC is bringing this film to its Jewish film festival because of the way the disabled personage Frankie is portrayed. We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. We demand money back. We encourage the writer to donate a portion of the funds to the Achad program at JCC to apologize. <br /> <br /> We do not like to see Frankie - a teenager with a mental disability and perhaps even autistic - as part of a joke in which he drops something to look at the nanny's breasts. There was no reason for Frankie's character, other than to say "Hey, being mentally deficient is funny." Challenges like Frankie's are serious. Families like mine are really suffering. <br /> <br /> The writer needs to explain. Does she know families with disabled children? Does she see families with disabled children week after week at the JCC pool?
