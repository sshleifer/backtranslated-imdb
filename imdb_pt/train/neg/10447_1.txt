I chose to see this movie because it got a good grade here on IMDb. But many people have a very bad taste or someone is correcting the score. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was a real disappointment. The film is just as stupid and absurd as the title suggests. There is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here it goes: it looked like someone was thinking, "Would not it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane?" And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff? !? "And that's about it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners in a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone!). The acting is bad, and all people are unbelievable sterile types. <br /> <br /> In short: it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
