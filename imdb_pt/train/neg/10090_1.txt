This movie is a joke. I mean a funny joke "ha ha". Because? Because the only thing left over is the good laugh I had with the absurdity of absurdity, meaningless plot and horrible action. Wow!! <br /> <br /> Within this film there are so many unanswered questions ... for example; Why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are caretakers and what is their purpose? Since when do 6 people form a "nation" of zombies? And is blurred "scary" black eye mascara for anyone, anywhere? Even at 2 years old? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why was this movie made? Because? because? because? No reply? That's what I thought. In the demand channel, they actually issued this comment after the movie synopsis: We apologize for this movie in advance "LOL. At least they had the decency to do that!
