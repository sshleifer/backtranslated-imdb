A cast of the 1980 TV series and guest TV series (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others) in the story of a photographer who dreams of killing his models. Of course, models and other people start to appear dead, causing all sorts of complications. <br /> <br /> The thriller is not very good and has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating, but not a material good enough to generate interest. This is best described as the kind of film that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternative name for Skinamax. I really can not see the point of watching this, unless you need to see all the despicable thriller out there. (I also have to comment that this movie is full of cigarettes, to the point of becoming ridiculous when someone lights up)
