This has to be the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. For the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at the time and had plenty of time to devote myself to a "just-for-the-go-of-it" movie. The condo we were staying in had this movie in stock - they must have bought it from the $ 1 store or something. <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he's made. It started with a bad premise and then it got worse. There is nothing remotely funny about it. <br /> <br /> I watched a lot of movies, including some that I did not like. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, do not say I did not warn you.
