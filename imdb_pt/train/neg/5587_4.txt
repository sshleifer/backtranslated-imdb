In addition to his "Tarzan" series, prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs has written many other books, though, in addition to the popular "At the Earth's Core", few of them have been filmed. One exception is the novel titled "The Boy and the Lion," brought to the screen as "The Lion Man" (1936), a talking, static, old, slow and boring film, despite being filmed. in real desert locations. In fact, "movie" is the wrong word. The narrative does not move, but proceeds in the rhythm of a snail in an abrupt series of idiots. For example, at least five characters receive elaborate opening scenes and then disappear. Even more frustrating for movie buffs are the characters who make a kind of impression (like the girl who lives in the Hall with junk), but are represented by players who are not credited! The credited authors usually go worse than strangers. One exception is the Australian actress Finis Barton, who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues the young Master Fairy. Admittedly, most of the cast is overwhelmed with the atrocious dialogue of King James, who must be heard to be believed! But the way this garbage is played is ironic, a ploy that seems not to have occurred to a single list of untold players in the movie. Maybe Director J.P. McCarthy dismissed this idea. Anyway, it's sad to see the lovely Kathleen Burke forced to deal with the likes of Richard Carlyle (his father) and Jon Hall (his suitor). It's true that Hall delivers his lines with a little more conviction than Carlyle, but that's not a recommendation.
