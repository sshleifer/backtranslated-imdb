I read some comments on the internet about this movie like "... harder than the Hostel ...", "the camera never shows when it's getting really brutal ...". But none of them is true. The camera never screens, because there is nothing to the screen. The same scene is repeated hundreds and hundreds of times again. Women are at a table, the killer rapes the women a few times, the killer cuts the women to pieces (you never see this all through the movie!). The police come and arrest him. Assassin deceives the jury. Movie is over. In Germany, we would say: "Viel LÃ¤rm a Nichts". All in all, one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
