Wow!! I remember so many horrible movies that spun freely in high school since the early 1980s. They usually had an incredibly forced plot and many 27-year-old actors pretending to be students. While watching this movie, I felt a bit of nostalgia for growing up in the 80's. However, then I discovered that this movie was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends there, that's bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a secondary school and threatening to transport all students to the downtown schools. Which is strange, because the students of this school are rich and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they can not find the money to keep this school alive, they have never heard of property taxes. Ah, but here's the kicker. The school board says they will keep the school alive if students can raise $ 200,000. So the seniors do that. Hmmm, you raise $ 200,000, but instead of saving it for college, do you put it to save the school that you're a senior? And why exactly do they close an overcrowded school before the end of the year? And ... Oh, forget it, this movie was stupid and made in 1989!
