I have the very cheap DVD and I am a total Drewbie, and that is probably the only constellation where this movie could interest anybody. <br /> <br /> An old Drew movie, she looks great, and she gets a lot of her cute scenes, like a bath scene, a sexy dance scene, a number of sexy clothes, etc. She never shows the friendly charm we know of her latest movies. <br /> <br /> The film itself is either medium or sub-medium, and much more like being made for TV than it is for movies. There is no real horror or accumulated tension and the dialogues are often cheesy. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end, because I honestly do not understand it. But maybe there's nothing to understand about it anyway. But at least you do not get the end you would be expecting, and it also comes much sooner than you might expect. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is exclusively for Drewbies.
