For anyone who craves a remake of 1989, the New York slaves. What are there seven of you? Here it is ... it was. <br /> <br /> This shabby movie has characters who are thoroughly numb (well, they're club-kids, ya big jerk!) who are keeping up with standards. The big question seems to be: how long can a young adult remain juvenile? Did it take three people to write this 'story'? Good Lord, it was easier to find Citizen Kane. Instead of taking viewers back, this movie should only embarrass anyone who has been a scene in the early 1990s. The idea that a fifty-year-old woman envies a bunch of selfish children of a different The age is the world as only self-absorbed, twenty-something years could imagine. The strange sidebar about working in the library is not the expected sub-plot of Parker Posey's Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo. She "I'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper messes with her is hysterical. Posey's speech is always fun, but there are projects that are below it. I was asleep before crossing the 40-minute mark.
