I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of that still haunts me to this day. I was fully aware of how awful it was, so I have only myself to blame. But like most, I did not believe all negativity. Being a fan of Sandler, it seemed inconceivable that one of his films could be so bad. I figured they were just Sandler's enemies. I could not be more wrong. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that does not contain a single second of anything funny. This is really an achievement. You'd think of a 90-minute comedy, they may have accidentally stumbled into something even remotely entertaining. But no, it's just awful. It's not "so bad that it's good", it's just bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you laugh, but it never comes. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where do people watch a videotape and die 7 days later? If this movie were on the videotape, people would die instantly with their own hands, and there would be a smile on their faces when they realized their agony was over, and that would be the first smile since they pressed the game. <BR> You may be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to contain your curiosity. No, please no. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those who think Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made, and those who have not seen it yet.
