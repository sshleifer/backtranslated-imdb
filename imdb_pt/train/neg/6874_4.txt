Jean-Marc Barr (Be Light, The Great Blue, Dogville) directed and interpreted this strange film that is the second installment of some kind of trilogy. I may be wrong, but I do not think this film is part of the Dogma '95 manifesto, although it does seem that way. I'm not sure what I think about this movie. All the actors are good. They have very good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I do not know, there's something about the movie that I do not like. The sex scenes are very long. It goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic crap that I do not know exactly where it is. Of course it's not a bad movie, but I'm not going to suggest people see it or tell you not to watch it. Just do what you want. If you feel curious and have an open mind, try it, maybe you'll like it.
