When I watch a movie, I am aware that it is "just a movie", but I still like to allow myself to be as absorbing as possible under the circumstances. I think that's what makes us cry, scream, laugh or react emotionally as members of the audience, even though, deep down, we know it's "just a movie." What I do not want is for the movie to remind me that it's just a movie, so I can not get into the impending expansion regardless of the quality of the movie. The director of this film preferred to frequently use multi-angle photos simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I think this is terribly disturbing and absolutely annoying. They can also run a continuous track at the bottom of the screen, "Attention: This is just a movie. Do not let yourself get too interested or absorbed." If I want to "picture-in-picture", I'll turn it on remote control of my TV, but never during a movie that I want to enjoy.
