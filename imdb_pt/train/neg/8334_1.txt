This has the absolute worst performance of Robert Duval, who sounds like William Buckley throughout the film. His melodramatic performance detracts from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this was deliberately stolen or inadvertent, but it's the only thing I remember about a really forgettable movie. This image should be shown in each amateur acting class of an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to produce a cultured accent. He's a good actor, but that's about it. Klaus is much better. His performance is mute and noteworthy.
