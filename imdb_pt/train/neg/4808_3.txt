Okay, I've seen a lot of movies dealing with witches and the occult, but this one was just weird. This movie begins as this witch cult led by a really bad Orson Wells on paper (could not have gotten someone who looked and acted more like a Satanist) he just did not belong in this movie. But anyway, the coven picks up a new limb and stabs a doll that looks like someone and causes her to have a miscarriage. The lady who had the miscarrage and her husband leave for a place called Lillith on the bus and the girl while she is seeing a picture of her sister or whoever is calling for her and warning her to stay away from there and never use her powers. there or she will die. The couple after settling in the strange city discovers that all the inhabitants are all wizards and she gets nosy and afraid of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things begin to happen when you discover a funeral happening on a hill that suddenly disappears (which was scary) as well as see the little boy belonging to Orson Wells in the playgroud which he later asks the lady to help him bring back To life. The lady soon tries to escape the city, but only to see herself imprisoned by her inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all that the spirit tries to alert her. This movie is ok, it has moments of suspense, but it really could have done a lot better than having Orson there.
