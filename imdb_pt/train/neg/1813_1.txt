If anyone wants to make a really REALLY bad movie, "The Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really sets a yardstick for measuring the depth of evil. <br /> <br /> Begin with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the movie. main character ... Some poor idiot in a white "furry" baggy outfit that looks as if it were sewn from discarded pieces of carpet. Work your way slowly, painfully, through effects not so special that completely deny the viewer the suspension of disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the hell of it). <br /> <br /> On second thought, skip this movie completely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.
