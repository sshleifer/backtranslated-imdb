You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: The Safety Pin Killer! That's right, in Killer Workout, a stupid horror movie, if I ever saw one, the invisible killer dispatches his victims with an oversized safety pin. It's a strange choice, sure enough, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Of course, the film never tries to clarify where the killer got such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, an aerobics academy is under siege from a mad killer and everyone is a suspect. In fact, the film gives few clues as to the killer's identity, almost everyone in the film is a potential killer until they are killed. And since almost everyone, except the killer, ends up dead, it's just a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, while the whole cast of the name is dead, aerobics classes continue to be serious. In fact, nothing is able to stop the dance. While three men are murdered in the next room, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; a character dies, but is still seen prominently in subsequent training sessions. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he christened the Killer Workout movie and not Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> Police chases, explosive tanning beds and hundreds of shots of exposed female flesh are played to good measure. Much like the woman caught in the tanning bed, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of Killer Workout. Finally, thankfully, THE END blinked on the screen. What happened next? You got it, photos of women working. Not even the end of the movie can stop them! <br /> <br />
