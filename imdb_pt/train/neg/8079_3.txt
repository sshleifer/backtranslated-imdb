Yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wonderful special effects that fall directly into the trash can. <br /> <br /> Dull direction and performances (with the exception of the adorable Annabel Schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and always honest Charlton Heston) gaining the rank of a true stinker. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see Heston perform his usual pair and show how bad this movie is. He even touches on a sub-plot that kept me interested just to see how it linked back to the main line of the movie. The way they ended up solving this was that they did not. Just fall off the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Do not waste your time on this.
