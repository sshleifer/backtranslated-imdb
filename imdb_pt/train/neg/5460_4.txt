Interestingly, season 6 of the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality on at least two of the scripts, based on this walk for the "man-in-the-mac" and also "Fade into Murder" <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is no coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman has written both of the above-mentioned scripts (incidentally he plays the murdered security guard here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is very rarely attractive and many of the artists just seem uninterested in the material. The story is rather poorly developed with some prolonged periods of boring conversations. <br /> <br /> Columbus is also shadowed by a colleague here (similar to the "Last Salute to the Commodore"), but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, the characterization of Celeste's Holm, which is intended to provide comedy, induces embarrassment rather than laughter. <br /> <br /> The script swings to deal with family history and the killer makes enough to present the Columbus case. , although there is never a credible discussion related to the motives of his crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, what becomes, arguably, Columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment of the series. He questions a male hairdresser and has a haircut / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it's just that Columbus's hair is so neat so he can not pay the bill and then, when he asks questions at jewelers, he looks in the mirror to admire his hairstyle! Unfortunately this is the only decent time in a script that seems to have been put together in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for the completists of Columbus.
