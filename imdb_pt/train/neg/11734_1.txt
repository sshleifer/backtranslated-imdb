Tasteless. I can not even write intelligently about the movie. I laughed the whole movie. It should not be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he's doing. His story is written, it seems, without any knowledge of Iowa's culture and the problem of methamphetamine. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his film even more intriguing to me. Why do the two main characters have an accent? It does not make any sense. The acting was mediocre at best and sometimes difficult to watch. Graceful violence and sex filled the film. I'm guessing that violence and sex should make the movie nervous, but that seemed unbelievable and offensive. The end of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the credits in disbelief. When I left the theater, everyone who was leaving was laughing with me. The ending of the film was meant to evoke tears, but did the exact opposite. Do not waste your time on this horrible movie, unless you want to see ignorant, silly, exaggerated nonsense and clich√©s.
