As a World War II naval history buff, and someone who is not proud of the history of race relations in this country, I was eager to see this movie. What a disappointing piece of schlock. I got about 3/4 of the way, but I should have turned it off in the sub-attack scene. The idea that a U-boat would fire a torpedo into a DDE, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and then being able to "escape" the DDE while it was submerged, is absurd. And that's just a little detail. The whole movie was poorly written, misdirected and misinterpreted. I agree with the others on this board that this could have been a good movie. It's as if they decided that, since all those World War II propaganda films were made with all-white cast, they had to make one with the blacks. And as bad as those old movies, that's actually worse. And it almost smells of fake advertising to head Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. Turns out they had much smaller roles. I have to believe that these two great actors were embarrassed to be associated with this movie. I finished. I gave a lot of my life to this fucking movie.
