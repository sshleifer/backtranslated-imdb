What a disappointment, especially in the light of the budget provided, of the technical resources available and of the talent gathered. It is not the fundamental rule for science fiction / drama to create in the audience the voluntary suspension of disbelief. The POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning by deceiving us, but from there Mr. Burton forgets that his viewers have brains at work. Helena Bonham Carter's over-the-top libertarian chimp, the uselessness of human entrapment, the ease of her escape, her extraordinary riding skills (this is an astronaut and a group of suddenly inclined human primitives), the massive and rebellious is unbelievable. Mark Wahlberg never projects any sense of real fear, danger or punishment in this upside down world. Compare the original, in which Chuck Heston's nudity metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an intrinsically crazy situation, and we never ask about his well-being. Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real danger. Tim Burton should have used part of the budget for a competent roadmap. In fact, after that inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers bothered to solve screenwriters and directors who attacked threats. Let them walk. The trained monkeys could have done as well as in Planet of the Apes 2001. I bet the repeated views of this effort will be nonexistent. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for the imagination. Another missed opportunity.
