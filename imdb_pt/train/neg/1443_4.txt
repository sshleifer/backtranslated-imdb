Start with the good bit: several times Swayze speaks Zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes. That's a big plus, as film audiences in the US and UK often think that everyone on this planet speaks English (if you're one of them: no, they do not). <br /> <br /> But the performance is 'Tenenkrommend', as we say in Holland (it makes your toes curl and not in a good way). I like Swayze, but in that he's horrible. The muscles in his jaws do overtime and he's frowning all over the movie - some of them must have told him it sounds like shit. Not Patrick: It looks silly and it's a compensation for lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) opted for a style of acting that does not fit the style of her co-workers. His acting is so relaxed that this movie could have been defined these days. And it's not. Her dress was a clue, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best performance came from the people of the African Continent and Sided Onyulo as Umbopa that I liked the most. Of course, warm and in character, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> General: it's mwah-fun on a rainy day. Feather. It could have been better. Shoot the director.
