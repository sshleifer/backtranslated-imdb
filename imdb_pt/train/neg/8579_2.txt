I'm afraid this is very terrible, despite several good performances and generally competent camera direction. It is a first and last attempt by scriptwriter and director Soo Lyu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate byproducts of the Canadian program to promote home movie production. While the program encourages worthwhile efforts, such as "New Waterford Girl," it opens the door for untapped newcomers like Lyu, who did not have to aggressively arm this project, but was enlightened without proper scrutiny of their script or their credentials. <br /> <br /> You do not mind the low budget because declining production design, poor lighting, bad audio and docu-style photo selection are consistent with the subject; the workers at Canadian massage parlors. But dialogue and plotting do not give the actors anything to work on, the editor too much to assemble, or a spectator any mental challenge other than the suspension of disbelief. When your story is simplistic, the last thing you need is a confusing storytelling technique; even if nothing happens, the film is difficult to follow and the viewpoint impossible to define. <br /> <br /> Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is several steps below his similar characterization in "Exotica". Lea, by Lindy Booth, is his peculiar and peculiar airhead; as always, she is nice, but here she is little more. Cindy from Kira Clavell is a nice surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, the street Betty of Tara Spencer-Nairn, more than nullifies her excellent performance in "New Waterford Girl". His superficial performance on "Rub and Tug" should reduce any tendency to look for other movies in which she appeared; unless you need more confirmation of the ability of "Waterford" director Alan Moyle to work with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly conclude that Lyu's reptilian brain can not understand concepts like plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy, lame device "deus ex machina" in the end is hardly a surprise. Still, it could be worse, the story without attachment has so little internal logic that the improbable ending is not as painful as it would normally be the case. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
