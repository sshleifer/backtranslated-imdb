Judging by the hype, and other comments on this site, I was ready for an amazing horror film focusing on addicts. What I got was crap complete focusing on junkies. I wonder if there's another movie called "Stoves" that these people reviewed? There are only 3 main characters, and none of them seemed well written or well interpreted. Basically, the whole movie that I just went through shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addicts. Do yourself a favor. Do not rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or some other decent horror movie. Hell, hire "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are scarier and more compelling than anything you'll find in "Cookers".
