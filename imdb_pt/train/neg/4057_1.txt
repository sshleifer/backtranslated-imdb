This is an extremely annoying movie. If you grew up during the Vietnam Was, like I did then you've seen and heard all the movies and arguments here hundreds of times. But what really makes this boring movie is the narration of director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the film is filmed with Sherwood talking directly to the camera about his opinion of this conflicting moment in our nation's history. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, then you will win 'I did not find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see the great George Butler Going Upriver movie! Stolen honor was clearly meant to be an ax-work on John Kerry, but failed miserably in accomplishing that goal.
