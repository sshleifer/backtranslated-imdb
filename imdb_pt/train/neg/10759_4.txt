Despite the great design touches of the future, Asimov's clever premise and Will Smith's legal and dependable performance, this film does not live up to expectations. The clich√©s come thick and fast; (waking up from a recurring nightmare, independent police officer has his badge revoked by the tough-guy lieutenant, more listing would ruin - you can see the end a mile away). This movie is also on stage - you never feel like you've traveled anywhere; what is supposed to be a global disaster never leaves a CGI, obviously in Chicago. The robots themselves are good in close-up, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad Disney - the CGI is overdone again and again. And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them, why do they need to inject 'nanites'? You know it's a fucking movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax. It could have been great, but it is less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the totally predictable plot that could have come from any action movie of the last forty years.
