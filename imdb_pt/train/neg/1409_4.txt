It's not really spoilers in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, though. As the executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore his character's countless absurdities in 10 Items Or Less, a film with an intentional indie feel, and only being absorbed by the mentor / being-all-you-can-be theme. He plays an alternate universe, a semi-washed version of the true Morgan Freeman, which is conducted on a former Econovan by a boy to Carson, California, in Brentwood, to research his next movie role. Why Carson, it's a mystery to So. Cal residents. He could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. Paz Vega is beautiful to watch, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, throwing a disgruntled grocery checker in a large but slow local market, which is apparently the best source for Moragn Freeman's research. His character is only known as "He" to allude to how actors are seen when found in real life by ordinary people - "Pss, that's him" etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted for Him to have all sorts of worldly wisdom. advice but had no reliable return back to his home in Brentwood, had no money or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. If someone has such a high opinion of himself that they believe they own a response to Everything as it does, so I have to see money and a Blackberry that displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that great ego that He definitely has. Nothing really happens in this movie. I do not believe that any of the main characters were substantially changed by their encounter with each other. He flirts with the idea of ​​adultery, but then that thought fails. This to me was similar to Steve Martin's Shopgirl, without the sexual affair. It was self-indulgent to Freeman and unconvincing to the public.
