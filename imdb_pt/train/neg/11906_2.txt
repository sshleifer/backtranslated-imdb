Watching "Der himmel über Berlin" as a teenager in the late 1980s was a profound experience for me - "so that's what movies could be." Along with "Paris, Texas" and "Till the end of the world," he still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to Wim Wenders' genius. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, years later a steady decline in the quality of his work with the "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" reaching a terrible low. Gone are the photos or captivating songs. No research or display of great insight. All that remains is hidden characters and political statements, which are nothing more than clichés and frankly deride the intelligence of a mature audience. <br /> <br /> Is the well dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders to raise or stop altogether.
