What MGM bullshit did you think would be a good idea to put the scholar Clark Gable in the role of a Salvation Army worker? Ironically, another beautiful star of the future, Cary Grant, also played a Salvation Army guy only two years later in the highly overrated SHE DONE HIM WRONG. I think in hindsight it's pretty easy to see the craziness of these roles, but I still wonder if the WHO thought the Salvation Army guys are "HOT" and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic depictions of the playing. A long time ago, I used to work for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (the Volunteers of America) and I've NEVER seen any guys studying there working (and that includes me, unfortunately). Maybe I should have gotten a job with the Salvation Army! <br /> <br /> So for the extremely curious, this is a good movie to look at, but for everyone else, it's a poor writing, sloppy moralizing and annoying dialogue makes for a very slow movie.
