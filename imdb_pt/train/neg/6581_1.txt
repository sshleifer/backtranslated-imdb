I hired "New Best Friend" hoping for a movie similar to nice teen thrillers, like "Gossip" and "The Curve." Instead, "New Best Friend" is much more like "The In Crowd," in which there are no emotions and the acting is incredibly fake. "New Best Friend" is boring, and the events during the movie are the same. Skip this movie ... it's a waste of time.
