I read some of the reviews on this movie and can only assume that some people are easily entertained. This movie is nothing. It's so poorly written, directed and acted it barely makes an impression. The characters speak in clich√©d dialogue and the situations are completely implausible. While this can make this exaggerated and fun, it does not happen because everything is so lifeless that the movie becomes monotonous. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality, but then she was not allowed by studio executives to give the story any real excitement or not having the balls. This movie can be included in the encyclopedia as the normal Lifetime TV movie.
