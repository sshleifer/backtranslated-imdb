If this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema, if you have never seen a "moving movie" before, you will think that this movie is a son of the gods. But if you've ever seen a movie, a TV show, up to Barney the Dinosaur, then you will not be too impressed with this movie. Heck Barney, the dinosaur, was even more realistic than the dinos in this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I like B. I just watched "The Giant Gila Monster" right before watching this conversation, and I really enjoyed the movie. It works like a B movie. It has lick dialogue, hilarious effects, cheesier and an honest to damn real Gila Monster as the monster! Carno 3 just does not do much of a punch in movie B. It has some blood, and this guy Polchek comes close to being funny sometimes, but this movie is below expected, almost ... flaccid. It's the little engine that could not from dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you should not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can watch the gum drying on a sidewalk and have fun. If you are one of these people, give this movie a chance.
