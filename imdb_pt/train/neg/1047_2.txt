Someone will have to explain to me why every movie that features poor people and adopts a pseudo-violent look is seen as "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything realistic about the characters. (although the actors have done the best with really bad parts) or situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-conscious effort to be "bold," "dirty," and "discouraged." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes much more than holding the camera without rhyming. or reason and do not illuminate the film to achieve any of the qualities above in any meaningful way. <br /> <br /> It is a sad commentary on the state of the independent distribution of films that the only films that see the inside of a movie The theater is nowadays all carbon copies, with bad cinematography, camera direction nonexistent and a lot of bad words struggling to pass for "Art". <br /> <br /> No wonder movies like "In the Room" or "On Schmidt" get such raves. I found them meandering and very average, but compared to the current number of independent clones like "Raising Victor Vargas" they are frankly brilliant and inspired. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, seeing an "independent" movie meant that you would probably be treated with some originality and lots of energy and care, and maybe some technical flaws caused by low budgets nowadays, that means that chances are you'll get another by numbers, we'll -Shake-a-camera-around two hours attempt to appease the lack of taste of independent distributors. And of course, all this to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and invented. <br /> <br /> Is it a surprise that the independent market has fewer and fewer surviving companies? Not when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the movies that preceded them.
