This was the third effort of director Von Stroheim - he is quite rude and shows nothing of the exceptional camera talent and mastery he would exhibit a few years later with his masterpieces, GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH. Essentially, we have a trio of grifters, disguised as Russian count and two Russian princesses who rented a house in Monte Carlo. Your goal is to use fake money at the gaming tables and earn a fortune. Part of this plan is for the count (von Stroheim) to hint between a visiting American ambassador and his "foolish" wife, courting her and hoping to make some money by playing on her weaknesses. He makes the mistake of also taking the savings out of the maid's life, whom he promised to marry. When she sees them together, she sets the room on fire (Von Stroheim and his prey are on the balcony of the room). Here von Stroheim first establishes his persona as "the man you love to hate". He is completely bad and his flaws in character lead him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is raw in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing, unless you are fascinated by the director. There is a bit cute - when he first tries to find the Ambassador's wife, she is reading a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim. This was originally imagined as a 210-minute film, reduced to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes. The restore in Kino Video restores the surviving images (damaged in some way in most scenes) from the previous alternative version to give us a 107 minute impression.
