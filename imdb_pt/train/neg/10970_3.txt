This is absurd - aside from the Australian colleague who reviewed this film, I can not help but think that everyone else who has undergone a review so far was involved in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they were with their praise. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm not much of a fan of comic book conversions with film, so I did not have high expectations, but I still found Elektra incredibly uninteresting. The thing that irritated me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this movie that went unexplained, which left you thinking "huh, what relevance does this have for the plot?" or "so how did this aspect of the character come about?" I can only hope that these are things that are perhaps explained a bit in Daredevil, which I have no intention of seeing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the behavior of the characters in this movie seems to make a twist at random times to suit the plot, and did not even tell me about the totally useless romantic sub-plot. I'm also (still) scratching my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, who seems to have been inexplicable. <br /> <br /> If I could praise this movie for anything, it would have to be the fantastic places it was filmed in, but otherwise I gained little pleasure from Elektra. I know we should suspend our disbelief in fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unlikely or confusing (even by the action movie standards) that it just frustrated me. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks pretty good.
