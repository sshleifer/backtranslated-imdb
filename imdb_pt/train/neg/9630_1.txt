I realize that several of Ben Stiller's movies are out or about to be released this year, but maybe he should insist on quality, not quantity. <br /> <br /> I was stunned by what the filmmakers thought comedy was about in Along Came Polly. "Stiller's Reuben is scraping, charmless and ranked as one of the worst performances of the year. Stiller's disconcerting is getting tiresome.He undoubtedly has comedic talent but he needs to find another chat or take a break, find some material that is really funny.Because his movies range from painfully humorless to incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is As long as she continues to make more films like "The Good Girl" (in which she is great) and less like "Along Came Polly", she will have a career as a director. which she would be proud of. <br /> </ p> <p> Aniston tries desperately to get over the flabby material with which she is working but is a daunting task for any actress.Apart from a few moments with Alec Baldwin as Reuben's boss, Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reuben's best friend, Sandy, there's nothing funny in this horrible movie. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's accent is not just stupid, it's awfully dull. <br /> <br /> The premise of "Along Came Polly" was certainly promising. Unfortunately, he needed a writer who could turn him into a good comedy rather than a boring, monotonous and boring excuse for a comedy.
