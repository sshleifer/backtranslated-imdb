Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a very bad movie. The premise was very good, but the overall execution was terrible. I wish the filmmakers had dedicated themselves to this project, instead of putting it into production. A blind guy gets new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to an evil werewolf. Unpleasant things begin to happen to the guy when he turns into a tacky-looking creature. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is this strange troll who helps you and what's with that female police officer? If you really want to find out, check out Werewolf Eyes! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad idea for a movie. I just wanted the filmmakers to spend a lot of time on pre-production before they decided to film the film.
