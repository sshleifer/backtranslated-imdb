I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get past the 74 famous videos that were banned in Britain. This was initially banned and relaunched in 2001 with a total cut of 10 seconds. <br /> <br /> Some college students spend their Christmas holidays preparing a dormitory for retirement. There are some scary characters lurking along with the four kids. Which one is the slasher? The actual murders are not very bloody so this nastie video is not really nasty. There is the necessary blink of the breasts, but it has nothing to do with college kids. <br /> <br /> I had a suspect very quickly and I ended up being right. Maybe I've seen many of them. The final twist was clever; I have to give writers credit for this originality.
