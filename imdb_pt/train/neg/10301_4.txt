It is a bit strange that a story that is placed in a part of Oslo, where a very high percentage of locals is from an Asian background, does not even show an Asian or African person, nor even as an extra. This fact probably describes Norwegian race relations in general. - However. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY ONE BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> Buddy portrays four young people living in a shared apartment in Oslo. The protagonist are two young people who can not direct their lives in a serious way, and it can be said that the film could be indecisive and avoid responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. The narrative plays in typical teen dreams and fantasies and lifestyle models. Very clich√©. Although the story is slightly funny, the acting is good, and as a "young man" one can identify with "crazy" situations of characters and complicated love affairs, I do not find the story or the characters very convincing. For polished and without depth. This movie uses all the tricks of the classic audience to make an entertaining movie that has both intellectual depth and 'Friends' (yes, that shows on TV). <br /> <br /> Has the Norwegian film finally found its identity? <br /> <br /> What about watching Tillsammans from Lukas Moodysson (Together)?
