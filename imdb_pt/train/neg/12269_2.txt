Japenese's sense of rhythm, editing, and musical score must be different from American taste, but surely that film could have been much more with a little more post-production work. <br /> <br /> Someone in Hollywood needs to get up. make this movie and I think it would be a great success. The story is interesting and creepy. There is something about the edges of the city, cops, earthquakes, sanitariums and mysterious saltwater murders that are enough to be captivating. However, this story has to make just a little sense and maybe it's about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the effect of the "sixth sense" was in full force in this film, and this was evident from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As it stands, only Japanese movie lovers should bother to see this film so annoying.
