This is the worst show I've seen in years. I believe it should be taken off the TV because of its delay. It's so stupid I can faint when I watch. (even though I never watch because it's SOOOOO poor) Goofs: When Mac says he can not eat sugar, in another episode he eats sugar. Almost everything in the world has sugar! In the episode "Eddie Monster", when the eddy shouts at Terrance, he falls into the crate TWICE the longer he falls, he does not fall, he falls to the side. What stupidity. I can not even say the word Foster Home. I even made a song with my band about how retarded this program is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
