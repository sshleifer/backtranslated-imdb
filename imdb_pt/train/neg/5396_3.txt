I read comments that you should not watch this movie if you're looking for a hectic Shakespeare dialogue. This is true, unfortunately, because all the stimulating dialogue, this wonderful piece contains, has been cut and replaced by songs. I read this piece and recently I was lucky enough to watch it, and it remains one of my favorite Shakespearean Comedies, but this movie seems to take everything I like about it. The Princess, though no doubt doing what she was told to do, had no real bearing, and all the girls seemed to lose the cunning of their characters - also affected by reckless courtship, which not only took the female characters out of dialogues scarce but it took comments out of context - it was a bit unnerving to hear the princess proclaim; "We are wise girls to mock our lovers!" When the mockery had not happened. The news throughout the film also interrupted the flow and produced many excellent scenes, as they showed the information in the scenes after them and were in modern phrasing. In conclusion, an excellent game, ruined by a strange concept and reckless cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What were you thinking?
