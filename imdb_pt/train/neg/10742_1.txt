I tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago. What a disaster. The acting was atrocious. There were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell like a lead balloon. This was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just did not sound true. Supposedly a modern redesign of Hitchcock's original "Lifeboat." I think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the thought of it. From what I have been able to bear, there is nothing convincing about it. movie.it has some semi-big names, but they do not put any effort into their characters. but, you know, to be fair, it was not anyone's fault. I mean, I'm sure the script blew up in the first explosion. LOL.it is possible that this thing will improve as it progresses. But for me, I'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out. So unless you have at least three weekend days on the horizon, avoid this stinker / 1/10
