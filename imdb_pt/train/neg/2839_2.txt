This movie is one of my favorites. Not good at all, but good to laugh. The dialogue can become incredibly ridiculous and misinterpreted (eg, "Manji, may we ask you some questions?" "Of course." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Any fight is more or less surreal. Be sure to look for Brock, the white guy who attacks the main characters. It only has two lines, but it's one of the best guys in the movie!
