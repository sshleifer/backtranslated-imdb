Hmm ?? I agree with the reviewer who said that "strange people with generous tastes have reviewed this film". I thought the movie was intriguing enough to watch it. I think it was mostly because of Marsden and Speedman - not the plot. <br /> <br /> The result is that this film is mildly psychologically tempting, on the one hand, and deeply homophobic, on the other. Thumbs up on the previous and triple thumbs down on the last. I'm not sure if the film is meant to promote dialogue or spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the acting was mediocre. Lots of conversation that was about a 90 degree pie of reality. I kept wanting to get some meaning out of the plot, but ultimately it's just a conversation with a crazy man (Speedman). I feel a little sad for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. Its loss is not greater and certainly less than the losses suffered every day by the world by more significant causes. <br /> <br /> Does the film expose naivety about HIV / AIDS? Yes: That of the intended audience. Is HIV an evil and mysterious murderer? What about the victims? The answer to both questions is no. Neither HIV nor its victims have a more or less evil intent than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, cancer or their victims, because of God. Just because a disease is communicable does not make it deliberate or negligent - or bad - it is just THAT. <br /> <br /> Does this excuse ignorance or risk-taking? - NOT. Should all people practice safe sex? - YEA. Will safe sex save the world? - NOT. Is safe sex realistic in all cases of love and lust between passionate and emotional human beings? ??? OF COURSE NOT. In what kind of world would we live if everyone followed the rules, no one took risks and sex was never spontaneous and passionate? Am I ignoring that the movie specifically deals with gay sex? ??? YEA. HIV is transmitted through the sharing of blood or body fluids between infected and uninfected individuals. Sex is not necessary for transmission, whether gay or not. <br /> <br /> I am always disturbed by the intentional violence of one person over another. I actually thought the film did a good job of portraying the absurdity of Tom's violent kidnapping, captivity, and intent on Dan, and that kind of insane violence occurs every day. <br /> <br /> Flow of awareness notes from the movie: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why does not Dan ask "why" do you feel that way, instead of "what are you doing"? Implication: Men who have sex with men get "AIDS" Implication: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility in sex? Why was Dan's responsibility to use condoms? "Maybe you slipped before you shoved him in?" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe she did not want to hear the truth" you're kidding me "She's in heaven and so incredibly hurt by what she now knows about me," right? Is Dan's life over if he has HIV? Certainly not! Is that why the whole world is so homophobic? Do they think gays are the cause of HIV, what will they give to the rest of the world, and will we all die? are you kidding me??? People are really stupid enough to think homosexuality is the cause ... is the problem ??? Do we feel that way about the victims of tuberculosis? of malaria? I can see that Tom is injured because of his wife's death, and he blames AIDS, but seriously? Who is missing here? The victim or the virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of the sick? (presuming that they did not seek and did not seek to spread the disease). <br /> <br /> Of course, safe sex is essential for a safe life, but neither is driving, not flying, not leaving home, not living. Do we really want to blame the disease on the victims? Had safe sex between Tom and Dan prevented Tom's wife from ending? Maybe, but not Dan's sole responsibility. Tom is crazy. Did I mention that? Tom to Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve" ?? LET'S GO! 24 Days: Violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Am I exaggerating? Possibly. But I think this film points a finger at homosexuals for its reckless and malevolent intent toward a "straight world" practicing unsafe sex, when the rate of homosexuals practicing safe sex is proportionally equivalent or better than that of heterosexuals. We all need to wake up and take HIV / AIDS seriously. HIV is killing hundreds of thousands of righteous Africans every year.
