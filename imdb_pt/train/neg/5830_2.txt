Drawing Restriction 9. dir: Matthew Barney. <br /> <br /> How do you know when you're in the middle of a pretentious art film? Are there only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film? Is it when Bjork is wearing what looks like a giant hair-colored pita on the head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Maybe when mammoth dung and spine are used in a whale fat experiment. Or, when are you about to kill the composer for making a minimal and still annoying version of a Philip Glass score? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of modern art films. At 135 minutes, it increases its claim to be boring. I would call it the use of stunning colors, and the interesting opening sequence, but the rest of the film seemed to have been filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary. That's until it looks like they were trying to film their version of P-ss Christ, but this will come later. <br /> <br /> In fact, the documentary-squire portions were the best parts of it. The surface plot is on a whaling ship, and then there is a ritual on how to make whale fat. Then there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney, who are greeted on the ship by undergoing a humiliating ritual which includes slovenly shaving (fraternity pranks), nicotine patches and giant hairy pita hats. . Then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism, and we can not forget the giant dung. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney wrote that it is the "relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity". It's almost like saying, "If you do not understand, then you're not creative in your interpretation, so run away because I'm an artist." Ah, wait, this is the postmodern interpretation of that phrase and what the movie would be if it were postmodern. But, supposedly, it's modern art. That is about the art itself. <br /> <br /> So, let's start this whole interpretation, right? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be considered as a realistic attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half hour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp. Obviously, the ramp symbolizes the need for self-elevation for any patterns you treasure, and the pearl divers are searching for pearls of wisdom. Then, on a whaling ship, they build a box that appears to be in the rough form of a whale. Obviously, a gross element of harbinger. <br /> <br /> On the ship, they make whale fat in the shape of the whale and remove the portion of the fins. They replace it with a backbone and then with a giant poop. These are supposedly the states of the film itself. When its fat, it's fun but bad for you. When it's the spine, it's the "important" parts of the movie, or the backbone so to speak. So the giant poop is the gut of the movie, or when the movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Bjork and Matthew Barney arrive on separate ships, are put on strange and humiliating clothes that are NOT WELL DONE OR SYMBOLIC, suspected that they ran out of money and Barney was trying to quit. So they put patches on your head. They go through a ritual and learn about the ship with a Japanese sage, who tells them that the ship is marked when another ship struck him; an accident or intersection if you want. This inspires Bjork and Barney who are different from the outside, starting to cut off each other's legs and eat them so they could turn into whales and be the same person. They intersect. Oh, did I forget to mention that this was done in a video by Robbie Williams? Then the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of knowledge pearls they drop to make a stupid Venn Diagram. Barney managed to get through the eighth grade geometry, obviously. Or at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot Bjork's score that I want to kill? Sometimes it's hypnotic, but in others you just want to murder it. <br /> <br /> The art film is one thing, but when you play all sorts of symbolism in the hope of getting a reaction from people, it becomes a self-destructive joke. When do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel often made nonsensical surrealities, but they were more coherent and / or fun than this piece of junk. Un Chien Andalou had the sensitivity to cram as much symbolism as it could in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So, can I recommend this? Only if you like HIGH ART movies with a lot of symbolism and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
