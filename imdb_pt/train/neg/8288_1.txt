Too bad Alan Clarke has to be associated with that gut. This does not exclude this; gather a group of guys and some Stellas and have a whale once in a while running again and again and rolling on the floor in tears of laughter. Great night lost. Al Hunter lives on a well-publicized theme from the late 1980s - hooligans were well organized and were not really interested in football - often with respectable jobs (real estate agent). But as Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors straying from other low-quality productions (Grange Hill) or soon passing into a shoddy drama (Eastenders) can make us believe that they are tough thugs is laughable . Do we really believe that the ICF (on whom the drama is naturally based) would NEVER go to another city to fight only with SIX guys? <br /> <br /> The ICF would expel subway stations and such things as HUNDREDS. Andy Nicholls' Scally needs to be read before even contemplating such a story. The acting is terrible and provides most of the laughter - Oldman is so camping that is unbelievable. Most of them look like they should be in a Mr. Matey bubble bath. A real inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera that they think can make a quick move to it.
