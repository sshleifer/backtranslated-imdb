I just do not understand some of the great premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that there is something so ugly that you would go crazy. Someone here made the remark that it might be the frequency of light waves or something rather than ugly. Miranda is just an idiot. The episode is slow, inconsistent and very complex. I also do not understand very well why Kolos is an ambassador - why does not the Federation leave the accursed Medusians? There's a part I like, when Kolos is talking through Spock about the loneliness of human experience. Overall, I love TOS and even at its worst, I'll always get in tune. However, this episode - mmm, I would not buy it, except for a copy used under $ 3.
