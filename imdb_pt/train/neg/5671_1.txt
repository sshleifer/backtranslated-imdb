If you like to see animals being skinned alive, their heads broken, dogs throats being crushed, my men stepping on them, then this is for you! But if you're a bit normal, and you do not need to see real scenes of animal cruelty, submit it. This movie tries to shock the viewer, and it sure does. With the snuff of animals at the beginning, and the death of babies in the movie (fake, at least), was enough to make myself turn it off. I've seen movies like this before that slaughterhouse filming show (BTK movie) and that kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie. We watch blood and horror because we know it's just makeup, and special effects, so we should not sit and watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, is not what we rented the movie. If anything, there should be a big warning label on these types of junk films so people are not surprised by this. As a fan of very hardcore horror, this turned my stomach. The entire cast of the film and its crew must have their heads checked.
