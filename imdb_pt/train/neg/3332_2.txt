I bought this movie on a car starter sale, so I was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it would still be quite nice to watch. However, it was not pleasant at all, but the acting and the film in general were ridiculed, such as the ways in which the 'unseen killer' kills its victims and how all dead people are just young. women. It was a stereotyped horror movie. I say this for the following reasons: 1) Three blond women in danger, most are dead. 2) One survives crawling in the dark while being chased by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help arrives in the form of a shotgun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, I saved you two odd hours, summing up this poor excuse of a horror movie, so you're now lucky enough not to have to watch.
