This is the kind of movie that wants to be good, but it sucks. First thing, what the hell are those punk trying to do with school? I guess kids do not seem to realize the gravity of the situation. Deker tells the girl that they under his responsibility when she asks why he wants to get back to them, but shortly thereafter he gives a gun to the wheelchair guy and wants him to go alone and fix the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors should pay for their food, but why not just give them the money to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity. Oh yeah and none of them know how to look. The stupid punk guy shoots the cafeteria nowhere like a madman. They all want to look professional, but they all suck. One more thing, I do not believe there is no emergency exit in the school, the children are trying several doors, but all are locked. What happens if there is a fire and the dummy safety is dead? It is illegal not to have an emergency exit at school. Anyway, there is much more to say, but it would be too long. I spent some time in my life to watch crap.
