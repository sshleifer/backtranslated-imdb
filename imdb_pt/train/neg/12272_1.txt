Put simply, this is the worst film since "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you liked this movie, you will probably like this). <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? Some ideas should be like this, an idea. The fact that this idea could be filmed should be a criminal offense. <br /> <br /> What was so bad that I heard you ask. One word ... EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Cost to Hire: $ 4.50 Cost to Check: 89 Minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund on both!
