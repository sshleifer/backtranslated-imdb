As one of the few commentators not to have seen the first movie, I thought this would be a very disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has a strange and funny kind of humor if you can withstand the (highly) morally dubious premise. However, it fails abysmally in the important areas. <br /> <br /> There is a fine, meaningless plot involving Gordon Sinclair's generous friend who may or may not be involved in a conspiracy to provide dangerous electronics to Third World countries - possibly on free computers ... or possibly not. Vague, long and inconclusive. The lack of a meaningful ending is so enraging and what is present is pompous and totally illogical. The movie looks half finished. Suspending disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) may be attracted to the unimpressive character of Gordon Sinclair, especially when he dodges his advances. Laughable. This worsens later in the film, when he reaches his romantic ambitions, then throws it all away for some ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Not many movies leave me feeling cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.
