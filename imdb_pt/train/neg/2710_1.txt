Somehow they summed up the 60s, ten years that radically changed our country in four hours. And what a painful four hours it was. They civilized the major events and events and "claimed" that it was about two families, but you barely saw the African-American family. If I were NBC, I would be embarrassed and embarrassed to drive this junk. What was fun was this carefree family you saw at the beginning was tortured in many ways, but managed to participate in all the major events of the 60's across the country. And the second family was a not so important factor. They would give maybe five or six scenes to this family. That poor son ... Please, NBC, do not make any movie about any other time ... leave it to PBS and to the History Channel
