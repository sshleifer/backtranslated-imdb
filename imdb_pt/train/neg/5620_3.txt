There is really no reason to examine this much more because of some very blatant and biased statements. <br /> <br /> A perfect example is when the filmmaker claims "Saul" or Paul of Tarus (the writer of The Book of Hebrews). He claims) has no idea that Jesus is or was a human being, this statement is purposely false, as he accuses others of presenting, or he is ignorant of what the Bible says. <br /> <br /> First we can examine your misleading statement about Hebrews 8: 4; which shows a quote "If Jesus were on earth, he would not be a priest", so right here He sets up the ignorant and unlearned observer to accept his false premise ... why? He does what most people who believe in the Bible accuse him of doing, in the same way. This is taking things out of context. <br /> <br /> Verse 1 of Hebrews 8 is; 1. Now from the things that we have spoken this is the sum: We have a high priest, which is situated to the right of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens "The above context is speaking CLEARLY of a Jesus who was on earth and ascended to heaven after his supposed resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his writing out of context. Here he offers a basis, that "Paul was not aware of a HUMAN Jesus, but only one in heaven" follows "? Let's see if the filmmaker is being honest Hebrews 7 and 14." evident that our Lord proceeded from Judah; of which tribe Moses did not speak of the priesthood. "<br /> <br /> heh, did not the filmmaker just quote the writer of Hebrews trying to show that the writer of that book is not aware of a" human Jesus "? it is likely that Paul did not write Hebrews anyway , but I'm not going to get into it, but the filmmaker claims that Paul did it, and that's the premise of the point given here. It's not like this filmmaker does not make decent points in certain areas, but he is involved in the same blind bias of the religion he is attacking. Once he engages in these tactics, in my opinion, he loses credibility as the religion he chooses, and the film is no longer a documentary, but a personal opinion and a bias of the filmmaker, nothing more, nothing less.
