This review also contains a spoiler from the first movie - so if you have not seen any movies and want, but do not want the spoilers, please do not read this review! <br /> <br /> Supposedly, the film is about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the film is a poor copy of the early Cruel Intentions. The actors who played Ryan Phillippe's Christian film and Kathryn's Sarah Michelle Gellar are very bad substitutes. Neither man can take away the arrogant, snobbish attitude of a rich kid that the original actors did. It's absolutely shocking that some of the dialogues were verbatim - not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough, you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this was truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why did Christian fall in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> In addition, the tie with the photo / "You could be a model" comment in the end was totally lame and did not add anything. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can not believe they made a Cruel Intention 3.
