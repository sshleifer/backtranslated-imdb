Kojak meets the mob. Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past who seems quite forgettable. I never thought his show was great. This is his one-dimensional characterization of a crime boss, with very predictable results. If you pick up the car chases and the general conversations, there is not much development or plot action. I think mafia movies are boring because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, Italian cinema, treats these guys as heroes. I saw the movie and in a few days I will not remember much about it. Lots of shots, innocent people dying, betrayal and that unhealthy loyalty. The film is photographed very well and the acting is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (because of voices that simply could not get out of those bodies) that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.
