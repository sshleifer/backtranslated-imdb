What is this with the Americans and their hanging with gobbledy-gook religious? To think that this was a bestselling novel is incredible, but to make it like a movie you really need good acting and a script that does it. In this case, all the good actors went to heaven and we stayed with Kirk Cameron as a CNN journalist (!) Trying to figure out why so many people just disappeared. Oh, yes, there is a subplot about a conspiracy from the world of evil and hunger, or something. The good news is that this is done cheaply, and with such an insane dialogue, it has entertainment value in all of your unwanted chuckles. Not recommended for anyone with a 3-digit IQ.
