This film is another example of the curse of East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories in one film. Other critics have obviously realized this, because there are several mentions to the "first part" and the "second part". How can you have some character development or a deep storyline when the characters and story are presented for so little time? I was enjoying the first part until it stopped abruptly (it did not "end," it just stopped at what seemed to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by a futile and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow!) I look forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai is given a decent road map to work on!
