The film 'Gung Ho!': The story of Makin Island Raiders by Carlson was made in 1943 with the goal of raising the morale of the American people during World War II. It shows in the best way that the cinema can constitute propaganda body. The value of this film is just collection and not artistic. In a propaganda film, it is useless to judge direction and actors. Watch this movie if you are interested in learning how advertising works in the movies or if you are a great diversion from Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film. If you want to see a movie for World War II, they are much better and goals. I rated it 4/10.
