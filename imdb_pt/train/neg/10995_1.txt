Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in recent years has probably seen ads for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie in 2001. It looked like it might be funny, but I was not about to call the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first. I figured I'd wait until the movie was available to rent at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I was on Tower Records and on the stack "DVDS for less than $ 20", there was a copy of this movie. Seeing that the DVD cost only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I got home, put the disc in the DVD player and waited for the laugh to begin ... and I waited a little longer. The laughter never came. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible. Sick, hopelessly insipid and poorly written and directed, THE FILM COMEDY UNDERGROUND COMEDY is atrocious garbage and is, in my opinion, the worst movie ever. No stars.
