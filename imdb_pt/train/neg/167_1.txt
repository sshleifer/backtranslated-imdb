Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or who has a clue about the plot, should be ashamed of this series. The Borg does not appear until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma section, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk finds them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship bearing the Enterprise name ... need I continue? Berman and Pilliar scoffed at Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw the $$$$ and went their own way. It is no wonder that Majel Barrett has been in every episode of Star Trek until this series. I do not blame her for not being involved in this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, just like the whole cast. I like them all, but the plot is tragic and ignores all the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was canceled prematurely).
