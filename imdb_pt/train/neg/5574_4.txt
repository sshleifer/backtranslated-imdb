"Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics such as pseudo-patriotism. Here, future travelers try to ruin Japan by replacing local hero Godzilla with his puppet monster, the three-headed gold dragon King Ghidorah. They fail, however, and in the end, Godzilla fights against Ghidorah. The battles between the two monsters are really cool, but the plot of the movie is full of holes and everything about "Japan is great" is really stupid. The creators of this film did not even threaten Japan's enemies with respect, making them stupid, big and blond, who are easily fooled by the clever Japanese. The good news is that, in the end, Godzilla and King Ghidorah almost destroyed Japan and ridiculous enemies in one (actually, two) spectacular combats. But until this actual battle, the film was really monotonous and pathetic.
