Ok, so here is the basic storyline. It's 1933, Peter Sellers is dr. Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese who lived a long time. The film begins with his birthday in which he celebrates drinking a special elixir that (even the film never mentions) prolongs his life. Well, on this occasion the elixir is awkwardly knocked over by an assistant (Kato, if you remember the Pink Panther movies), and he orders his subordinates to look for 6 rare items to make the elixir. This creates a global human hunt whereby his henchmen eventually steal diamond museums and venture into London to meet Dr. Fu, a retired detective from Scotland Yard Nayland Smith, also played by Sellers who tries to stop him in what is supposed to be. to be a comic spirited adventure. <br /> <br /> This was apparently Sellers' last feature film that he did before he died. The terrible tragedy is that he was in it. Sellers who is such a talented comedian and had memorable 'funny' roles in Pantera movies and particularly in the movie 'The Party', is anything but, in this film. This movie was an absolute torture to sit on and I could not finish it. He dies completely and I kept shrinking while watching the seller's performance. After coming from the great work of 'Being There' a year earlier like, I mean how can he do this and how did he even do ??? As a person mentioned the first 10.15 minutes are ok but then it is ALL DOWNHILL ... <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Rating 1 out of 10.
