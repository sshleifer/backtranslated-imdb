I've watched this movie a few times and all I can say is that this is low budget junk and it has nothing to do with the real facts of the story. Actors performances is very poor, but is the result of limited acting possibilities. Anyone who has watched this movie now probably thinks of Hitler as a crazy lunatic who runs with a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that there are much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Ascension of evil is far below average. I can recommend the German film Downfall in which you can see the brilliant performance of the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler.
