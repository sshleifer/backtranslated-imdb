The buzz for this movie has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set and finally all the visible elements of that film.

Even the minimal number of elements that were specific to an invisible man's film (infrared glasses, sprayed with something like paint) were poorly handled. <br /> <br /> What is sad is that there were many possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie.

Suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they do not think about pulling the plug of a machine instead of ...
