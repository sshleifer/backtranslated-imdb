Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) went through college. When scary Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers his secret, he blackmails them to help him score with beautiful and good-hearted Angela student (James King). Stupid and incompetent "comedy" - much more groaning -inducing than inducing to laugh. The movie tries to attract its target audience with its disgusting jokes - but NO JOBS. What's more, it's full of worthless, unattractive characters - and Schwartzman's character is so disgusting that he's a big hunk. The film still attempts to use 50-year-old singer / actress Mamie Van Doren in the film's most outrageous scene. YUCK !!! <br /> <br /> Continuing to bring out his total predictability and the waste (again) of the talent of veteran comic actor Joe Flaherty - when this guy will stop accepting all the roles that appear and do something Thanks the pity <br /> <br /> In short, the only thing I liked was James (also known as Jaime) King, who was very attractive - and deserved something better. <br /> <br /> That's no more than one of ten of me.
