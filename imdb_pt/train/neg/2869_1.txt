The story goes like this, Netflix delayed sending my DVDs, so I went to the location location analog known as "Blockbuster Video" They suck. Too bad, they have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for their viewing pleasure, but I never want to see any of those. Then I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all for his self-solitude. I like watching movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I will never understand, so I want to see this kind of thing. Anyway I put this DVD and suddenly from the first second, it sucks. I'm sitting there with my bf. and we're like, "What's this kind of crap?" Unstable camera operation, horrible acting - the first scene where a woman is killed, you wonder if she prefers to just talk quietly then a mouse gets stuck in the throat. I really wonder if the director has a penchant for this crap. There is nothing decent about this "movie". All I have to say to the director is "Do you have a fucking tripod?" Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was horrible. It was as if they decided to someday make a movie. They were probably gathering people from WalMart to come and "act" for them. Simply awful. If you make a film like this, then driving is your hobby - NOT what you should be doing to live - Should not get to the outputs of the DVD for movie fans like me. Better leave it at home to your friends when you're having a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them .... So you open your movie BTK KIller and say, "Want to see this shitty movie I did once?"
