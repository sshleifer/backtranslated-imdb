or: is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, look ... It's a disaster! or: No need to look at the sky. <br /> <br /> Or: (... Right, that's enough.) If the singer tried to make a romantic and titanic movie hit the box office record, he failed. The SR structure can not do this, the dark and narrow color scheme (I would call it "wishi-washi"), the usual boring dialogues, the clown with advanced alien technology, fun and magic that are missing, etc. makes the movie completely disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just does not work. <br /> <br /> The main thing about a character like superman is that he is a superhero. This is the core, the most important thing. Love problems and a sadly depressed depressive Supersoftie can only be one facet in a 2:40 Superman movie, not all the time. <br /> <Because then it is no longer a superhero or superhero movie. It's like a (and in this case a very bad and annoying) social study, where every 30 minutes a person flies around. <br /> <br /> That's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy Wanderer of Heaven, this is the Superman, so give us Super Villains, Overcoming and most importantly, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want ENTERTAINMENT! Singer, if you want to do a long 2:40 soul love drama problem about lost and, unfortunately, people? So grab normal human characters and remake yentl. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then, supersadlysoftie stands at the door. <br /> <br /> Maybe the singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but a bad movie can not do that. Do not give up, they plan a sequel ... <br /> <br /> Next time singer (and Warner Brothers), make a superhero movie, not a depressive superlame soap, or let it be. A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover. Yes, technically there are all sorts, yes, there are many small talks, there are some jokes, action scenes, etc., but the only thing all these worst parts have in common is their poor quality. It's no more than a super annoying quilt and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous casting strategy (Cast them as young as possible, then we can make sequels in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old reporter star, she's looking like 19. Superman was full five years away, so he slept with her six years ago, so she was 16, and a daily reporter on the planet, spending a night with the superman. "Warner Brothers, that's too much. Routh is not so bad, he's touching some wood, but the whole movie is made of wood, so ...? they were marsden and sometimes posey.The rest, forget it.Even with space, this is not your spot. <br /> <br /> Reeve / Hackman / Kidder were acting so easy, with fun. The next time that Spiderman, Batman or Ironman falls and they get up like they do not want to do it, they do not like it. Jesus or angels? Or they speak directly to God.Why are not they? They are superheroes, saving human lives. so at least one conversation with God every week should be possible ... Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Maybe this was not the actual movie advertised, instead it's a bizarre parallel universe. <br /> <br /> For the warner brothers, this super depressive movie will be possibly the greatest disaster in history. Not just because of the money. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it was (maybe) to create and carry some messages or feelings but to show lonely, lost and unfortunately people are not new and thousands of movies or TV shows did better, in very old or new ones, such as magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than this flying super-woman, sorry, superman, of course. <br /> <br /> Singer and WB, this is nothing. In fact, it's more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for comic books and superheroes and robs us three hours of our life. <br /> <br /> Ms. Smilla's younger brother. (Very angry and green as the hulk.)
