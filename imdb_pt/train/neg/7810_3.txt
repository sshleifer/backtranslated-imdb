Against All Hope is a very badly made movie, sometimes painfully. This is Michael Madsen's first movie, and it shows he's not so good at it. Some people may find the story laughable; an alcoholic realizes that his life and family are crumbling, so he calls a preacher a last resort for help. After telling the preacher his story, he accepts Jesus Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> I actually found many of the religious scenes, such as when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to a church, but departs from it, quite realistically. I also liked how Cecil knows that his life is breaking up and he tries to get help, but realizes that only God can help him. In the end, he realizes with the help of God that he can go through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well done. The acting is bad, the script could use some work and it looks worse than my home videos, but it does have a good message. Now just because you become a Christian does not mean that you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track. Overall, if you are a Christian, you will appreciate how this film portrays Christianity, and if you do not, you may end up being called to find out more about the faith.
