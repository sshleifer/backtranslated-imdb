I do not know what Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they must have seen some very difficult things to see in order to be able to win it with an Oscar for best picture. All I know is that fortunately there was Gene Kelly to play or it would have been twice as bad as I believe it to be. First of all, I do not think Leslie Caron really could play such a role. She's not that talented, she's not a great dancer and she's not pretty at all. It's a shame that an actor or actress could ruin a movie as if it were playing, because if Leslie Caron was not in it, she could have made a great movie. The story was clever, the direction was not bad and, as I said, Gene Kelly was very good. Now I'm not saying all about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I'm just saying because I think it's the worst part of the movie. She is probably a good actress, but I can not say why I did not see her in anything else, but I think she was very bad at "An American in Paris". So if you want to see, go ahead, but I'm telling you, you're much better watching "Singing in the Rain".
