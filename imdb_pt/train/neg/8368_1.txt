While watching the little man, you'll spend your time trying to figure out your many holes. And that's not a good sign because this movie is supposed to be a comedy! You should be laughing at this !! But you go? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the little man is his concept - it's too ridiculous to be accepted (even as a cartoon comedy), so when noisy, difficult, and exaggerated jokes arise, they make the whole thing seems ten times dumber than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy" some of you may be screaming. That's true, but that's no excuse for such a stupid plot. I mean, let's think about it, if you saw a baby with the face of a grown guy, would not you be suspicious at all? What if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly, why did not he put it on a nearby shelf instead of a random women's handbag? And how can a qualified doctor NOT recognize that Calvin is a grown man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, it's about the laughter" you may be screaming. Well, the thing sees, there's almost no giggling in little man and it just makes the ass bum stand out even more. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a comedy of the wayans brothers with a belief in suspending the plot, stick to white girls, because at least that got some decent laughs. Whatever you do, avoid the little man.
