I saw this movie recently at a film festival. It is the novel by a former unemployed alcoholic who has just emerged from a major depression and a middle-aged woman working in a job posting (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich√©s, taking the 'social' theme of the film and turning it into a romantic comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working-class woman, she seems, acts and talks much like a 'high-level' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen interprets herself. She does this in all of her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene from the movie was very poor. The photograph is ugly, is not wearing well in all panoramic proportions. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and bland most of the time. The comic situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case are not funny and are poorly resolved. In my opinion this movie is not worth watching. Only if you really love the previous Pereira movies, you can enjoy this one bit. Anyway, I left the theater because I felt like I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was at the door. I wonder how a director is when he sees someone coming out of one of his films, especially one that is meant to please everyone.
