"John Hughes's son wrote a high school drama!" I thought as I checked the information on the movie here in the IMDb, late one night on Saturday, having found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just watched and, sadly, was downhill from there. Arguably you can not ruin such a bad movie, but I will leave the spoilers out of this review ... <br /> <br /> There is a lot of style about very little substance: unfortunately the style has not dated very well in the eight years since its launch. As for the substance, the film tries to put an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but under the bright veneer, a remotely significant or relevant argument does not materialize. The characters are painted in broad childish lines, falling into the kind of generic stereotypes that the writer's father sought to question at the Breakfast Club. Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping pace (perhaps relying a little too much on information mounts, which soon becomes a tiresome trick, but at least boosts the story), but his efforts do not sufficiently undervalue the poor script and bizarre cast (as one should stay on the 'Maddox' side, when Blake Shields gurns and glowers his way through the part, I just can not understand), not to mention the numerous gaping holes. in favor of a creative license, but when "bad guys" know that the identities of "good guys" turn their lives into a disgrace, but they can not take action to stop them, you really have to wonder why this script did not suffer some re-drafts before the production - daddy even read?). <br /> <br /> I'm sure a younger audience can have fun with this movie (and all the power it has to them). ) but it is better to stick with Hughes' high school production and if the idea of ​​rebellion in school is what really y appeal, the 1968 classic "If ..." is a much more satisfying exam of the subject.
