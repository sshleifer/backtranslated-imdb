After watching the first 20 minutes of Blanche (sorry, I could not take it anymore), I now confirmed that she did not. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "movie" is an insult to the true French actors who participate in this futile garbage. It begins with a concept used successfully in French comedies ("Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with anachronistic tone / dialogues. This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "delicacy" of direction, avoiding the dreaded stigma of "heavy comedy." <br /> <br /> Sadly, Lou Doillon spoils everything and Blanche, instead of a comedy, has just turned into a horror movie. Horror for moviegoers who want to be intrigued and shocked watching actors like Decaune, Zem or Rochefort fighting in the middle of this burlesque burlesque farce.
