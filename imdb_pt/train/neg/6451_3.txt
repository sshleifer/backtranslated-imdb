"Steve" (Chris Hoffman) reunites a high school group for a meeting at the cabin where his twin brother Wes disappeared. While they are there, a reptilian creature in the form of a man (reminded me a lot of Gillman of BLACK LAKE CREATURE) waits in the desert choosing the right time to separate them one by one. A motorcycle rider, Ellen Ripley, a female bad-ass type, Kat (Chase Masterson) has an underground military bunker in which she practices experiments, while also serving as a place of safety against the thing in the bloody tumult. Kat knows more than she is saying (she also suffered the loss of a child), but there is another novelty that most of the group has no idea. This creature may be only more human than they imagine ... and its earlier identity may shed some light on a deception that only another person has hidden since Wes's death. Kat holds the key to many of the mysteries they unlock while the group remains close to the cabin. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, a large part of the film stays away from the creature that jumps in the air while we also see a fuzzy screen as we look through the eyes. The film has Dawson's Creek melodrama, which often hinders any real tension that needs to be built into a small movie of monsters. The steering is very soft, leading to a relatively dull experience, rather than causing fright. The cast is quite lifeless and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace (THE FOG remake) may be the only attraction for this movie.
