Right away, this movie was ridiculous. Not that it has no redeeming aspects? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful backdrop. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that the south does not have beautiful mountains like those found in the west. I knew it was Utah right away, but maybe Dalton could not stifle his English accent, so they had to apologize by saying it was a southern town. Subverting his accent into a southerner was easier. Of course the movie has twists, but its false sense of place was something I could not get over. It's not as if Utah did not have meth labs ... so why the writers found it necessary to pretend it was in the south, it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in action pictures always puzzles me. Why do they always make the sound effect of "arm" when the character pulls an automatic weapon? It seemed like all the other sound effects in this movie were "chuk-chich", meaning that a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire. Of course, the guns already had rounded cartridges, so that was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pyrotechnics went far above the top. But hey, this movie was directed to a certain "market segment", I suppose ... It's too bad. Each of the actors can act, but this movie was lame.
