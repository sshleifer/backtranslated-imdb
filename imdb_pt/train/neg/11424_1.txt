I noticed that "Fire" was on cable the other night and I started watching it because I could not remember anything specific about it other than I remember it was a horrible movie when I saw it at 85. Twenty years later, the movie is still horrible. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music in the 1980s, as is evident in the title song. Listening to this song again made me want to pry a screwdriver into my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted on them. And to compose this musical attack, Rob Lowe's character played the saxophone, and there was a scene in which he played a solo that continued and continued as if it were Charlie Parker, only his shrill ringing and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were intensely unpleasant, though I must say they did a great job of conjuring up equally unpleasant actors to portray them. In fact, I thought Mare Winningham was attractive, and initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear, but by the end of the movie she decided to have sex with the character of Rob Lowe, who would probably be elected to transfer a variety. of sexual diseases if such a thing were voted on.
