It was pointed out in a post now deleted from another IMDb user that anyone who could see "The Medusa Touch" should be warned about a scene that strangely resembles the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York. But I hope anyone reading this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye", co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced Oscar-nominated "LA Confidential" and screenwriter John Briley won an Oscar for "Gandhi" ) and an international cast, I found "The Medusa Touch" to be a riot of heavy, unintentional hand laughter. It was a misdirected mess, terribly written and manipulated. He tried to capitalize on the genre of the 1970s telekinetic thrillers. The film fails in many ways. Please consider "Carrie" and the underestimated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two fun and exciting thrillers who dealt with the same subject.
