For a good half hour or so, I remember thinking, "Hey, this could very well be Bill Rebane's best achievement ever!" The opening sequences are atmospheric, immediately there are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stench "The Invasion of the Giant Spider" in a playful way. The concept is blatantly stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill," with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers into a secluded mansion to win $ 1,000,000 in a elimination game. Of course, participants begin to disappear quickly one by one, and the greedy fellows gain too much time before they realize that the old ones are sadists ... or there is another killer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange narrator telling a lot of nonsensical things that are not relevant or even interesting to the plot, but there are some nice T & A to admire in the first ten minutes and this silly idiot (Shelly, I believe what she's called) is really hilarious to observe. After the first half-hour, of course the inevitable happens and "The Cold" turns into a textbook of Rebane-production with delayed twists, the most idiot dialogues ever and a total lack of enthusiasm. There was no budget for bloody murder sequences, but our multi-talented director (?) Tries to make up for it with endless footage of disco dancers and an amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them is a bit satisfying. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: Return of the King? Avoid this movie, you will live happier and happier.
