One more example of the total waste of money from the UK Lottery. How commercial was this movie? The Film Council, which funded this miserable junk, was to be trapped in one of the London Underground's abandoned stations for letting that clich√©d, somber specimen commit to filming, a half-mutant thing made up of all the horror films the director saw . and it seemed appropriate to imitate, most notably the Death Line. Among his many sins is the obvious failure to make the main character remotely understanding until the last minute. It's a little too late! Surely all those development executives at the UK Film Council might have noticed this in the script phase. Add to that the terrible acting and laughable appearance of the creature and you will have a prime example of how not to scare.
