Ok this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious according to the movie that they just went through an apocalyptic war, but they have money to buy huge robots and put them against each other. Each country decides, instead of investing in the reconstruction of their country, that it would prefer to fight with robots that nobody could pay. Here's a better idea, let's rely on our most inept resource, athletes, to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone talks about the director, and about him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give credit to this movie just because of the director, maybe he was sleeping? I really liked this movie because it was so extravagant and ridiculous that I had to laugh. I really enjoyed watching, well, except for the cowboy mentor who ends up being a killer (believe me nobody would see this guy as a killer, so it's a surprise, no matter how weak) What kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway. I was sad to see that Mst3k had not done it. I am giving a rating of two stars however, because nothing could be as bad as "hands the hands of fate." <br /> <br /> The budget does not matter, I have seen many reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube. The plot was neither plausible and I have seen acting better in school plays. Surly they could have provided an eleven year old from any high school play. <br /> <br /> Either way, it's a fun movie to watch.
