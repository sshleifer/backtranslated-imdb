"Piece is Cake" is defeatist, revisionist history of the worst kind, whose sole purpose is to destabilize the reputation of the (admittedly fictitious) pilots it portrays. It left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> In March 1989, "Airplane Monthly," Roland Beamont wrote a poignant condemnation of how the RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV miniseries.

"Piece of Cake" is a total and utter misrepresentation of how Fighter Command pilots acted at the time. It is nothing less than complete and utter disgrace ...
