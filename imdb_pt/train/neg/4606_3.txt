This movie was an attempt to get into places that most do not and maybe should not venture out. It was a similar test in the bizarre outlook of the main case given to us in The Cell, though it is not so detailed and well portrayed. The plot is simply constructed with an exaggerated initial feel. So when the film assumes its supposed "dramatic" turn, the plot undoes on that few legs it had to get in the first place. <br /> <br /> Basically, the idea is that of a boy (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He takes on the role of a murderer, killing an accountant in town. So he is not paid for his work, but instead is tortured for several days because he dreamed of the "brilliant" idea of ​​trying to use a backup file he had as a lever for payment. This stupid move in trying to force them to pay it backfires when it is horribly and endlessly abused. It starts to get crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, thinking that he has paid for his sins and can start over, he visits the wife (Kari Wuhrer) of the man he killed and earns his affection. Soon after she finds out who he is, the tragedy strikes, and revenge sweeps the air as the boy chases after his torturers (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for his previous "gentleness." <br /> <br /> I have to ask, what is with Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore type movies? <br /> <br /> It seems like everything she's put lately has been in this genre. Granted, I liked her in "Eight Legged Freaks" and she was good at "Anaconda". But for all her cuteness and obvious fascination (wow, she's hot!), She can act much better and choose better roles. Or maybe, I'm wrong and that's just a misconception. For all of you out there, you get to see her "totally monty" in this movie, although it is quite bizarre and short-lived. I almost felt that she did some soft porn after watching this movie (something that is not strange to Kari's career). The sexual simulation is such that it has to make you wonder what really happens during the filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will say that there is a good performance. Just do not expect too much from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems forever meant to support his brother Alex. The film brought some great names, George Wendt (Normas de Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job of playing the main character, Sean Crawley. His little acting experience, and yet his believable nature as a naive young man, brings some substantial elements to the film. <br /> <br /> I would not go out of my way for this one. If you are bored and tired of the same old episodes of "The Hitchhiker," then I advise you to watch this. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please start acting on some better movies!
