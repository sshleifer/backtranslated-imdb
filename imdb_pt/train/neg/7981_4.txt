The newcomer suffers a lot. There are the random musical songs interspersed in the film, the long and meaningless script and the pastelain enough to let Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Leavitt just do not know when to give up. It takes an hour before the story finally reaches the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. So the guys start playing Japanese sailors with the racist caricature of the day. It's a shame that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt are playing the stupid and stereotypical Japanese. But, it gets pretty tiring after switching between two character sets. Then it ends abruptly. Even a Julie Newmar naked on a towel can not save this. <br /> <br /> There is very little charm in the movie and it's over half an hour too long. The story just walks along trying to create funny situations and fail. Stick to Martin & Lewis. At least Deano had charm and Jerry had that cheery face.
