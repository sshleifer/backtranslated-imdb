I saw this movie for the first time around twelve o'clock on a Saturday night. It really is the perfect time for this. I've never, ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched in stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action movie, do not watch because you can lose the will to live in the middle of the road. However, if you want a good laugh, please watch! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my lovely Saturday night. What struck me especially is that every scene that would be expensive to do was copied from a Discovery documentary or from a former US Army TV special. Also, I was amazed that they made no effort to make the production look real. After all, as far as I can remember, Afghanistan is nowhere near any sea, and yet with just one click, Deke escapes the terrorists with his jet-pack and is taken by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the film, Deke plays an Islamic terrorist against the wall. In the slow motion scene, you can see beautifully the long hair of the Korean stunt cover in the air when it hit the wall. You have to love this. I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer, only then you will understand why I have been crazy enough to spend 6.99 â‚¬ on the box.
