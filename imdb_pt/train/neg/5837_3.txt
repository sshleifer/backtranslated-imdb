I can not say I really liked this movie. He has a few fun times, but he does not seem able to decide whether it's a comedy or a drama. It also does not work. take it in pitch to be a drama, and the fun moments are few and far between. also does not make much sense. Things seem to happen for no reason. and is also extremely complicated. while they were going. If they had just taken a little time to explain things, this could have been a better movie. I would say the ending was anti-climatic, but that would mean the rest of the movie was actually piling up. for something, which did not happen. Just order the ends, and that's it. I did not find that boring, actually, but like I said, there's simply no point. I'm going to give Winter Kills a reluctant and weak 3/10
