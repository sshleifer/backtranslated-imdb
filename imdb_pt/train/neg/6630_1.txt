This so-called remake is terrible. I went to see tonight .. on the first day, as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to deal with. But in the first half hour we knew this was a disaster. Not only does it not match the hype created, but it also insults the original blockbuster. The script had loopholes, the edition was messed up a few times. Mohanlal, who is an excellent actor, did a good job. Amitabh was well .. the director wanted to portray how bad his character is but he went a little overboard which resulted in being strong. Ajay, who is especially good at this kind of role, was also a disappointment. Let's not even start talking about the new guy Prashant .. no one would be proud to start a career with something like that. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown by some laughter, could not even smile at anyone because of his vigorous mood and shrill voice. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. All in all, RGV which I thought was one of the most talented and talented directors that India had .. failed miserably. He took on a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best Hindi movie of all time and made a mess with it.
