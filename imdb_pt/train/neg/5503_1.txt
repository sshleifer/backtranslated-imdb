I grew up watching the original TV series in the sixties and one thing I can tell you right away, there is no comparison. This movie was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive. A Martian who took different forms. Special effects that looked like something a child would create. In contrast, in the original, the characters were developed and viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this movie, yes, really there was one, occurred when Ray Walston finally made an appearance at the end. He wore dark glasses and made references to live on this planet for 30 years as a kind of homage to the TV series. But even the real Uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
