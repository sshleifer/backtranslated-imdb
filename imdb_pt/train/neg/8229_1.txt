- Contains miners' spoilers - <br /> <br /> I've seen several decent indie horror movies like The Hamiltons, The Love Boys Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt Five Across the Eyes did not fall into this category. From beginning to end the film is plagued with amateur acting resounding from a very poor script, God knows why the writer (s) thought of dialogue as: "No, do not go there, do not go there, you: if she catches you, she'll kill you and if she kills you, you're dead "is movie quality. <br /> <br /> This film exhibits very little character development and to be honest I could not care less about what pain and torture inflicted on them because they are just a bunch of college girls who do not show almost no redeeming quality. " All they do is cry and whine all through the movie and if the girls are not crying their arguments; when they talk, the topics are completely random: about dating boys or how one of the boys was cremated (appropriate subjects when you're being chased by a psychotic killer). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also abysmal displaying techno playful music during the beginning and end credits (although listening to the credit song knowing the end was approaching seemed like a paradise). <br /> <br /> Camera work is terrible and sometimes makes the movie unacceptable. I'm guessing that due to having little or no budget, the director was limited to just a digital camera that resides in the girls' car almost all the movie. I think this was an effort to keep the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But due to a very unstable camera, grainy image and being very close to the action, it can be difficult to tell what is happening during the action scenes and is simply chaotic. It's one thing to make a film subjective, but it's another on-screen action that audiences can not decipher because of poor cinematography. <br /> <br /> I understand that Five Across the Eyes is an indie low budget movie, but this does not excuse the extremely poor quality. There are no redeeming factors for this film: bad acting, poor routing, poor camera work, and no story. In the light of all this, I decided to give the film 1 of 10, because it left me very disappointed; wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief. Her 94 minutes of stupid college girls crying, arguing, aimlessly and having inappropriate random conversations. However, how often do you see girls defecating in their hands and throwing crap on the windshield of a car that is chasing.
