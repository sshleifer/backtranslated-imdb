When I was in school, I made a movie about a couple wandering through the trees and talking, and I realized in the middle of the editing that this was not just a failed aesthetic strategy but a clich√© of Canadian cinema: full-body lyricism married to empty metaphors overloaded in the social commentary. But whatever the failure of my own film I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing. For one, mine lasted 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content: every piece of useless business here is struck down by four, five, six merciless minutes. The male protagonist is simply amazing, a loud and deafening growl given to theatrical class improvisational explosions among philosophical insights drawn from U of T pub, and he earns a lot of space to make us hate him. Admittedly, if it were not such a hole, the third act would make even less sense, as a couple of sarcastic faces appeared to provide distant, utterly useless echoes of "exploitation" values; but it does not make it easier to watch the cussed "please" beg in close until the magazine is over. I take back what I said about AUTUMN BORN, who at least had the guts of his own lust: this cinematic crater is and will remain the worst Canadian movie of all time. At least, I really hope so.
