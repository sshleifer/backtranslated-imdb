I got this movie in the hope that it would be similar to the hilarious "The Gamers" from Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is filmed in this fake documentary style that was famous by the office but failed to deliver. The reason is, in part, rigid acting, but especially writing and direction. It's true that it may be funny to use all the cliches about RPG, but this is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene, you know what the "joke" is all about. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is described above the top. There is no subtlety in this film, if there were subtitles "LAUGH NOW" or a strip of fake laughter in the style of the 80's, it would not make much difference. With some scenes you can not help but think "Yes, I understood why they found it funny", but the way it is executed takes away all the impetus from the possible joke.
