Watching this movie? I thought to myself, how much rubbish. These girls must have stones for the brain, even if they agree to be part of it. Waste of time watching, weak skies, I only hired him. The performance was below standard and the story was unbearable. Whoever is watching this movie, please save your money. The movie has no credit whatsoever. I am a true movie buff and this is worse than "Green Tomato Attack". <br /> <br /> I just hope this piece of junk has not cost much to do. The money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world. I just hope there is not a sequel to the plumbing.
