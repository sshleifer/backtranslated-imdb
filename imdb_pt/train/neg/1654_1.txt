Final Score: 0 (of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible specific spoilers of the scene (but who cares) <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. And I rarely give 1s. Even for the most pitiful of the movies I look for things like music, cinematography, imagination, it's humor, even a good pace to be as objective as possible on the scoreboard. Looking within their own genres or subgenres. But there is absolutely nothing redemptive here. I do not remember again that a movie really sent me pacing back and forth when we finished. The only reason I came to an end was because I could not change channels - I just stood there in horror, watching to see what insulting stupidity was. It was like watching a snake digest a mouse. <br /> <br /> But let's have fun and push this baby away, shall we? First of all, there is nothing technical about "Whipped" that works. The visuals are all sitcom style. The cut scenes all just photos of the street traffic passing at night over and over. The music and score not only do not contribute anything to the movie - it's unpleasant. Not to mention that you have nothing to contribute anyway. The acting is like a cardboard that comes from all sides, and this goes for Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" who also destroyed this train). These guys, supposedly good friends, have no more chemistry or sense of purpose, so if director Peter M. Cohen had met them at a bus station minutes before filming. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is no original bone in your body. You have no imagination. It does not show us anything we have not seen a thousand times before. The whole premise, or "twist," of this film is based on male criticism and the "idea" that an empowered woman can play men "in the same way they are played." Anyone who thinks this is somehow a turnaround or is somehow original, has obviously never turned on a TV before. Twisted and shallow women are common. Male attack is the norm. It's not stealing anything, it's worse: stealing cliches. I can not imagine a woman making a movie that would show other women based on stereotypes and with that sense of contempt. It makes me want to go rent "in the company of men" - or rather, "there is something about Mary." This movie wants to be a "bolder" version of "There's Something About Mary", so bad you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The movie has no insight into women, men, dating, sex or really anything. Cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths with which he has been indoctrinated with other sexist films. On the other hand, the film also does not work as a satire, because even if it is full of exaggerations, one can see that "satirical" does not have the basis that satires need. You do not even know what it is to satirize. Then there is the dialogue, which is a bit more than the characters screaming obscenities at each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh yes, well f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, the thing that could excuse all other discretions: There are many no-holds-barred movies with no good acting, morally repellent characters and dialogue obscenity that were funny and therefore good. "Whipped" is not funny. Not for a second. Has no comedic abilities or time. The situations are completely false, not based on any fragment of truth, especially enough to get laughs from us. The characters are all widely designed so that they are related to the lowest of the lowest common denominator. Just look at "the marquee scene", classic "cult" hair gel scene. One of our clumsy anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena's (Peet) vibrator. For some reason, the light shines as if he had found the Holy Grail. Why does Cohen think that men react to vibrators in this way? I do not know. As he scrubs on himself, he falls into the toilet and then tries to catch him with his bare hands when, oh my, Mena walks on him. Ah, my sides. <br /> <br /> But strange as it may seem, people really like this movie. Of course, people also like "Friends" and reality shows, so I should not be surprised. All of this has a common thread however. "Whipped" is great evidence to me that there are only a large number of people in America who will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex. They will enjoy any show or movie (or find they like) just because it is about dating or relationships. It is the lack of any quality has no knowledge about these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated into blindly dividing anything related to selling cheap, empty, and effortless televisions, movies, and any number of products. <br /> <br /> The only consilação will be that when I die, because I saw this movie, I have a credit to recover 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
