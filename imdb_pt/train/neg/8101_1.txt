It is often said that movies can never be the same as the original book. Well, in this case, not only is the movie not as "good" as the book, but it is an insult to the book. I'd rather see the Milan Kundera novel burned than in this "thing," which the director probably calls "adaptation." <br /> <br /> Any beautiful philosophy that asks "is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or to deal with the unbearable lightness of being?" is put aside, and instead, the whole film is about the sexual adventures of Daniel Day Lewis (I can not tell Tomas) with his dumb wife, his lover, and his other lovers, Fran√ßois Truffaut has already said this: bad directors make bad movies, do not waste your time and money. .
