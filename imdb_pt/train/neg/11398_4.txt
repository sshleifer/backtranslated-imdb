I saw this movie mainly to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), who I met briefly in LA at a model fair in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she did very well by acting in her role. As she is a presenter and TV model so beautiful and balanced, it was no surprise. I was wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result. Maybe I missed it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure about the genre of this movie, and although I liked the actors, I felt it was for college audiences. I tried to keep an open mind, considering that horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt like I'd gotten over the jokes. It seemed to creep in some places, leaving you guessing in some places about what powers the evil teacher had, and how many other movies had an unsatisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> Having written a few scripts I know that a lot of this is difficult and can boil down to personal opinions, how many movies you have seen and studied, and those with which you relate at a given time. <br /> <br /> In short, I found it interesting, but not a satisfying plot ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) had returned through the portal at the end and kicked everyone's butt that would be a satisfying finish and would get a higher rating.
