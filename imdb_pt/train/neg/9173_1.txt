I've never seen a movie worse. <br /> <br /> It is possible to pick up a video game and turn it into a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: absolutely no connection to any movie. of the characters. In this movie you do not relate to any of the characters because ... you have no chance. <br /> <br /> The only character that is nice or even interesting is the Deck Hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the result of the film is meaningless, since all the characters were lifeless from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Error 2: The worst shooting scene ever. I love shootings. I love when the heroes open up in the badguys and clean the house. Heck I even like to watch a badguy clean house sometimes. But this shooting was weird, I think the best way to describe it is "Apathetic" I've seen people shoot with more emotion and feeling while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAME. In this film, it seemed that the "actors" were simply walking shooting at everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where's the trash talking? Where are the grunts of anger between the shots? These are supposed to be kids who got caught up in a rave that went wrong ... but even real soldiers acting professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a good horror movie about an isolated house full of monsters, I recommend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is the house of the dead. I hope they burn the master and all the copies of this movie.
