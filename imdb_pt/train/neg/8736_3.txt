The film had a good concept, but the execution simply did not match it. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, in terms of history, it's "Dirty Harry" finds "M". A murderer of children began to terrorize a city. Top detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never dealt with a serial killer before. The mayor and the police chief desperately hired the local gang to speed things up ... go places and do things the police would not be able to put an end to this mess as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> To be fair, this movie really has some good things to offer. <br /> <br /> Beyond the concept, I liked the look of the killer's hideout. Norman Bates has his basement. This guy has a strange sewer. In some photos, the light is reflected by water and creates undulating reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a chilling and dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> The performance was also good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who improve with age. <br /> <br /> Once you get over it, more or less goes down. <br /> <br /> The film is stimulated very fast. The actual research process of both teams seems very rushed, instead of feeling intricate and fascinating. This could have been fixed in two ways: either make the movie longer or cut out some of the many subframes. Any of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the true mystery. <br /> <br /> For an example of how bad this is, one of the crucial clues that helps them focus only on the right suspect is this: at one point in their life, the suspect went to a pet shop. That's right ... I'm serious here. It is as if they have passed from point A (the first lane) to point Z (the suspect) and skipped all "intermediate" steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. The only ones I really liked were two pick-pockets that you find in the middle of the movie. Since they are secondary characters, I would call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the angle of the mafia. This is what gets me the most, because that's why I spit $ 3 to buy the DVD in the first place. I mean, what a hook! There has been an absolute excess of serial killer movies in the last 10-15 years. The Mafia angle was a trick that COULD have helped him rise above the rest ... but that did not happen. <br /> <br /> I imagined that the thieves' methods would be brutal, but fun and exciting at the same time. ; kind of a watcher movie or something ... maybe they even played some elements of assault movies as well. We're talking about criminals, after all. Instead, we got some of the most repulsive characters committed to celluloid. Detectives question witnesses. What does the Mafia do? They interrogate and kill them. Nor is it as if these witnesses were really that bad. I actually found criminals less sympathetic than the killer they are hunting. <br /> <br /> Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to get your interest, I would say that this is a fault. Maybe someday, they'll reuse the same idea of ​​history and do it right. I believe so. I hate to see such a good concept wasted.
