The brides are dying on the altar and their corpses are disappearing. Everyone is worried, but no one seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening, nor can it stop that from happening. Stay with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, since he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his former wife and keep her alive. Keep with me. Finally, authorities imagine that someone should be planning the killings and disappearances, but of course they can not figure out the improbable reason. Let's just ignore ridiculous pseudoscience and move on ... If you can get through the first 20 minutes of this mess, you'll be treated by Lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he murdered, explaining that he finds himself sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror films (the kind with budgets and tangles). Anyhoo - a female journalist follows the nose to the culprit (and notably the inept police is nowhere to be seen!), And then the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and acting are good. There are many well-dressed and very beautiful people in this movie. The direction is fair and the script is a bit better than the material deserved. However, this film can not sustain everyone's interest, but the most hardened movie fan b. The best thing about it ... eventually, but not soon.
