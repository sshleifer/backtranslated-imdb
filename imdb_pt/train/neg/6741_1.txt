Seriously, I'm all for romantic comedies and will be sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas ... but this movie? Does not make any sense !!!! And I'm not even talking about voluntary suspension of disbelief from making no sense. Why does her family live in England? Or at least why she does not have a British accent? She is very comfortable with her father and he is surprisingly forgiving because she has not been around for the past two years. (On this subject, no one does much about her being away for so long). And what was with the silly clothes at the farewell party? I will not even get into the fact that the escort she paid falls in love with her - that could have been surpassed by a better movie. I'm just saying that the characters, the scenario and the plot are not detailed enough to make a story a bit cohesive. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the consistent use of the filmmaker from the most unfavorable angles on Deborah Messing's nose - I would have sued the filmmakers if I were her! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women to be who they are, but why, in seven years of loyal Will and Grace, did not I realize how incredibly weird is her nose? Oh! Because these producers are kind to her! This film, like my other favorite movie, Armageddon, is the filmmakers' fault, not the actors. I can see Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This easily wins my vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted time. I'm glad a friend lent me his DVD, so all I missed was the time. If there was a way to do this ZERO star review, I would do that.
