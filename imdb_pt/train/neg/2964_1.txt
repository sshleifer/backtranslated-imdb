It laughed a lot - because it's so incredibly bad - sorry guys, but definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I know it's a low budget, but anyway: the actors behave as if they're joking, the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I saw such weird pictures was on a trash night at some youth video festival ten years ago. I really appreciate people getting together and recording cheap movies, but at least a certain quality should be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were interesting and looked cool - and the punctuation really paid off. The DVD cover promised a lot but it is by far the best this movie has to offer ...
