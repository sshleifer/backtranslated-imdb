If you really want to really waste two hours of your life, do the following: 1) Watch the TV listings. 2) Find the movie 'Men in White'. 3) When 'Men in White' appears, sit down and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After going through two hours of bad jokes, terrible movie references (and not so funny) and experiencing something with the lowest production figures ever made in recent history, you'll have wasted two hours of your life and wonder exactly why . <br /> Why did I do this? I was stupid enough to think that this movie could be really good. Was not. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, if you are old enough to remember Power Rangers, you can identify some familiar faces during the movie. Presumably, to save on production costs, Saban (who also does Power Rangers) decided to liberally spread old monster costumes from the favorite franchise of all toys throughout the film. I saw some old episode monsters that I saw when I was a kid, so I guess they could at least be said to have some nostalgia value. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the real Power Monsters Rangers, go watch the Power Rangers itself. It's way better than this piece of crap. (And that's saying something!)
