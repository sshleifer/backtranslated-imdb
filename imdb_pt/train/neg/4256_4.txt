Ascension is really a step forward in terms of what the original film was in history and in special effects. Jason Scott Lee It's good as a vampire hunter looking for his own count (if you remember him, he was from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story.) Jason London is funny as Luke, the boy who helps the woman he loves one far steals Dracula's body from the slab. Diane Neal Good as the woman who steals Dracula's body to find a cure for the dying boyfriend, and Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Giving a better performance than Gerard Butler did the count in the original film. Roy Scheider completes the rest of the cast in this film, and he does a decent job as mentor to the character of Jason Scott Lee. This is the second sequel to the trilogy, and they are off to a good start. It's on the air if the last movie will end the series on a good note.
