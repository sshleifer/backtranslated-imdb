This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I was expecting an extravagant movie, but at least with some cool car scenes / races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene has such a low budget that it has sped up to seem like the cars are "accelerating". In one scene, a Mercedes SLR goes from 200 to 0 in just 4 seconds, spinning in circles. It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, watch the series fast and furious. They can be a little bit extravagant, but 100 times better than this movie could be. Better yet, watch Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made, I think.
