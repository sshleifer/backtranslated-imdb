Vodka Lemon is a delightful extremely uneven Arminian film that will delight some and annoy others. Though reasonably well-crafted, the film has no real zing, relying on many scenes that will seem ordinary to the astute art spectator. The film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a movie worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many points of view disoriented and angry. You can laugh, but those moments will be few and far between a sea of ​​snow-capped landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides. A noble effort, made ultimately by the lack of narrative cohesion.
