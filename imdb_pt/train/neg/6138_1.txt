This movie was horrible from conception to execution. Does the US need to create a "Star Wars" site in this remote country? Is that their premise? The way to gain access, conclude the US, is to win an obstacle course as a cross-country race, where the winner can ask anything of the leader. And who better to win this race known as the "Game" than a gymnast? Of course! A gymnast would be the perfect choice for this quest. And do not forget that his father was an agent. Lucky for us, there is gym equipment at lucky locations, like the horse with stone loops in the middle of a square (for no apparent reason) in the middle of a crazy city. Perfect. <br /> <br /> But above and beyond the horrible HORIBBLE premise are the awkward clumsiness of the romantic scenes, the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point the way to the race, and the worst climax of all. After winning the race, our hero exposes the wishes of the US government. And behold, all the effort paid off, because the US receives its "Star Wars" site! Huzzah! THIS YOUR WINNING TRIUMPHANT?! Wow. <br /> <br /> But even so, being such a bad movie, it can be a lot of fun to watch. The cover alone, portraying ninjas with machine guns, was enough to make me rent this movie. <br /> <br /> But if I were to meet Kurt Thomas (the astro gymnast) in real life, I'd probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1/2 twists in the layout position.
