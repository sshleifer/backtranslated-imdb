If this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a classic of bad movie cult, it may (I would say perhaps) have been a success. Have you sat down and watched such a horrible movie that has become fascinating in terms of flaws? Well that's. All actors should be nominated for worst-performing performance awards. It would be difficult to find another film, with this type of production budget, that contained so little value. The whole thing, from the opening scenes, defies logic. The dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical. The same goes for the behavior and general plot of the film itself. What is really incomprehensible is that some clowns in a boardroom actually make decisions to spend money on that piece of junk. Wow.
