Bela Lugosi, an insane and weird scientist who uses orchids to attract brides in order to steal the essence of the old woman's life. The dwarf in this movie is hilarious !! A lot of freaks, plus a lot of fills and no plot, make watching this movie a nightmare. I loved how all the pieces fell together at the end of the typical Hollywood fashion. The story never gets interesting, and you feel helpless as you watch. Normally, I would mark flicks like this, but the dwarf added enough shivers and entertainment to earn a few more points.
