Yeah, well, I definitely regretted giving up on my Saturday night by watching this weird but long, movie. Apparently not even the main character stole two hours of my life. Here's the epitome of anti-hero in 'No Regrets'. We have this idiot, so confused, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unpleasant that it was exceedingly difficult to overcome the attraction of the promising son of a highly favored business man, Jaemin, unless it was just that: physical attraction. He affirms the opposite, which is love. But after seeing this, it's like loving Charles Manson because you have a beard. (Alright, it's not that bad, but there are still no real features of ransom.) I never got through reason Jaemin endless pursuing Sumin. It has never been shown, just said, that Jaemin loves Sumin. Maybe it's a culture thing that flew over my head: crazy / stalking = crazy love in Seoul. It has to be because a little more than half of the movie is one chasing the other and the last part is going back and forth to the point that I thought this was turning into a crazy comedy. I was waiting for a tiger called "baby" to make an appearance. Ok, then Sumin works two jobs while studying, so far so good at someone trying to improve. But after his first taste of the lure of his pursuer, he gives up his daily job for some kind of prostitution. What? Okay, well, as mentioned earlier, the obsession does not stop due to job / career change and if you play a lot of very angry characters, you will have a messy movie where unbelievable occurrences seem to happen without buildup. Basic movie, not 100% terrible, but you can do better with foreign films with gay themes.
