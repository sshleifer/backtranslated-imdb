I never thought of seeing a movie worse than "Lisa Picard is Famous," but that came pretty close. As often repeated throughout the comments, it was predictable; five minutes into the movie you know you will be a stranded in the end result. This movie painfully refers to everything from "Something about Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther". The writer Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs some new material. <br /> <br /> The only turnaround is the disturbed boyfriend / police chased by internal affairs, but even this opportunity is wasted. Many photos of the Space Needle in Seattle are needed to disguise the obvious local Canadian filming. Some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled by the city in a trailer. Wow, at least turn the wheel or put the brakes once in a while. Selma Blair is inert and short haircut is a crime. $ 3M for Jason Lee, for what? I think it's better than to skate! <br /> <br /> So here's who should see this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors sing "Islands in the Stream" badly; People who do not get tired of Julia Stiles. 1/10
