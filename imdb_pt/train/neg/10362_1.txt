Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie had been set in the 60's, as the book was. And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adjustment ... I'm glad that maybe someone could be influenced to read the books ... but, Man with interchangeable red eyes Like it And what about the volcanic revolt? Where was that in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this film. I certainly wish I could identify you. I can only imagine that it may be closer to the real story than this poor adaptation. This movie needs to be X'd.
