Another great film from Costa-Gavras. It is a great presentation of the situation is Latin America and the US involvement in Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be accurate, but it is a fact that the US was deeply involved in coups and support for Latin American dictatorships. Despite this, although the spirit of the film follows the typical leftist / communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, he portrays US actions as brutal and inhuman, while representing the extremist activities of Tupamaros as something positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, it was a boon to Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the US got involved. Europe is full of poor Eastern European prostitutes. I have never heard of Uruguayan or Chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse, as is the case in most Eastern European countries. The US was fighting a dirty war and God bless us all the monster of Soviet communism was defeated. It is unfortunate that the US has done what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you need to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world like Costa-Gavras and Matamoros like to believe. If Matamoros had come to power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film follows the corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of past times and tries to pass it on as idealistically and morally. correct.
