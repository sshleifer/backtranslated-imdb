Good God, that was awful. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and I thought it was going to pluck my eyes too much at the Oedipus Rex mansion. Dear God. this movie does not deserve more credit than anything done by a high school movie buff. Please save your money, this movie can not offer anything. unless you enjoy parallel viewing and sleep in cinemas. You know, bring your girlfriend and do interesting things. you will be the only ones anyway. F @ ck this slide show. <br /> <br /> You be warned. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you do not watch this. <br /> <br /> Hello. <br /> <br /> How are you? /> <br /> I'm very good. <br /> <br /> Enjoying this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> This comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this movie. this is sad.
