The best thing about camping movies in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or a daytime soap opera or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the tiny storyline, identify the cardboard characters, and watch with satisfaction as all the cliches are being fulfilled. However, sometimes the director does something really unexpected. It can be something extraordinarily stupid, or something strange, or something insightful. Director Makinen is up there with the best camp directors, and this is his best film. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to come together. There is nothing good about it, but it can still be a coherent whole. Not once does the movie slow down - the action flows and the punches keep coming. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no sense of time: some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have just spent an hour in a bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer where the sun never sets, so you do not experience the day turning into a night at all. <br /> <br /> Finally: there's a plot, there, somewhere. You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it.
