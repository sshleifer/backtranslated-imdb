Wow. In the twin cities we have a station that shows a "bad big movie" from Monday to Friday. The nugget tonight was a movie with Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a very boring woman who ends up being murdered when bad guys invade your house. Bea (Beatrice) returns to haunt her husband. She wants him to seek revenge on her killers, hence "she's back." And she will not let him rest until he does it. She irritates him non-stop ... and the spectators too! This movie is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies, though (my favorite movie is Xanadu). I was really shaking my head throughout the movie, wondering who I thought would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is so annoying. The plot is silly; the acting is bad; the story ... well, you understand me. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - a really bad movie, check out this one. You will not be disappointed. Heh
