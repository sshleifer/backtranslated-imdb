It simply should not have been done. It is predictable and clich√©. The on-screen chemistry that made the first "My Girl" so captivating is not found here, and the acting as a whole is flushed and forced. The writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines, like "earpeircing a barbarian custom" are just shocking. Where "My Girl" sparked genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments, as so many "My Girl 2" sequences try to recreate these emotions generated by the public, and fails miserably. Maybe I'm being hard on this movie because of how big the first one was, but it honestly insults the quality of the original with the kind of drivel that this edition brings. Surely this has to come close to "Son of the Mask" as being one of the worst sequels of all time. In both cases, the old saying sounds true; "if it is not broke, do not fix it".
