This is a strange film cut together, you have the feeling that the securities company had to come in this one, I am not surprised that there are no credits on this, who would like to be associated with this movie. The acting of all involved is terribly flushed and the plot jumps all around, everything makes very little sense. Like I said before, it looks like the title company had to come because it looks like there was a lot of filming that was not filmed that needed to be, and the whole song was a really bad library song (I think). Very strange. In fact, I could buy a DVD if you could let me know what was happening and what happened to this movie.
