It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive character (maffia) of the Russians, or at least of those Russian able to travel outside its great country; that it is very easy to rob a bank in England; and that British police are so inefficient that they can not find the person who stole the bank, even when those individuals are leaving the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and her supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by aliens in the Urals, but far from being the Russian. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, go to Moscow or St Petersburg and keep busy learning the grammar of the Russian language and its pronunciation.
