Oh dear, oh dear ... <br /> <br /> To JM fans, this was the coffin's nail when it came to their Hollywood career. After solid turns in Girl Can not Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter, it seemed like Jayne was well on the way to becoming one of the hottest stars in Tinsel Town. However, an obsession with aggressive advertising and an appearance in that clunker relegated Mansfield to the sidelines, namely, cheap cash loans until Fox could withdraw from his contract at the earliest opportunity. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a fiendish movie. waste of everyone's time, with the exception of Suzy Parker, which is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her annoying performance for the film's bad returns at the box office, and while it's a pain in that movie, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Cary hardly lights the screen, does he? After a handful of dramatic and very good comedies, Jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress, agreeing (simply to appear with Grant) to portray this shrill and idiotic threat. Her character from Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, all of her appearances in the movie shock her nerves. We all know that Jayne could do a lot better than this scum and yet she's parading like a prize pudding. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Avoid this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than funny.
