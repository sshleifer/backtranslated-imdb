We love School of Rock and Jack Black. We could not wait to see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the movie was so bad that I wanted to leave. My husband hated it, too. The only funny parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stay outside the theater and tell people to save money. The writing was horrible. He had every terrible stereotype of Hispanic people who should be totally offended. The movie was not so long, but for us it seemed like forever. The people in the theater were so restless and silent that it was like watching paint dry. I made my husband stay because I was sure there might be some redemptive parts, but there was not. Save your money and your time.
