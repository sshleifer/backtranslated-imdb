I just watched the guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie, despite having very good FX, better than I expected, was not a good movie. I honestly can not say I liked this movie. Of course it is effective in its way of being a shocking, realistic, twisted 43 minutes of torture, but I found it to be very annoying (and not as bloody as I had hoped). And I also found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and tried to look tough all the time, which spoiled even more (and I'm sure there are people out there who will agree with me on this). I've seen guinea pigs 1,2,3,5 and the best of which in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of flesh and blood. I will not say much more about the Devils experiment, plus Great fx, offspring acting girl, chagando torturadores, I usually give 4 stars because of the FX because they are incredible.
