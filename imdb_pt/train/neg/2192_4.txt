Another movie that is based on the banal and worn-out clich√© of the crazy scientist got crazier. The film revolves around a surgeon whose ambition is to bring the dead back to life. I know, I know ... you've never heard of this before! Of course, as all these films go by, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a maniacal and bloodthirsty creature. For this promising setup, you would think that would be at least a little suspense. Wrong. Like many films of that era, the idea is cool, but the execution and script are mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've ever seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but neither is it one of the gems.
