Believe it or not, "The Woodchipper Massacre" gave me a complete gonorrhea! That's right, I have a rainbow of vomiting throwing up from me just because a group of kids went to play with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the Devil and got distribution. It is beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this type of film. The only reason I got through it (not without several suicide attempts down the road) was because, first of all, I was delirious with boredom, and second - I think I wanted to explore more of this kind of hatred recently discovered. I was experimenting ... This movie is a "horror / comedy" movie / movie about three brothers who stayed for the weekend in the care of their elderly aunt. The younger boy ends up stabbing the old woman accidentally with his Rambo-replica hunting knife. They then begin to dismember Aunt with various tools (apparently she did not have a single drop of blood on her body!) And put her in their father's rented wooden shredder ... her son then condemned to look for her mother and kids end up grinding that idiot too ... I do not remember seeing a cast of annoying actors that really made me nauseous. Seriously, that voice of a blonde girl made me shudder in pain constantly. ALL the actors were utterly atrocious - literally just yelling their fake dialogue and jokes that must have been written by a chimp who just did not care! Now, I can usually appreciate independent efforts, but only from those who may realize that other people besides their relatives may be watching it! I do not need to see a 3-minute shot of a car coming off a carriageway and a tortuous, painfully long set up, with a ridiculous and restless song playing on it. Besides, why on earth does the box in this movie have a bloody piano? There was a piano in a scene and no one is dead near him! I just remembered this movie. Unless you like unbearable crap, I advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this crap.
