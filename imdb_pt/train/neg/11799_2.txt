This could have been a good episode, but I simply had to turn it off. The British performance was horrible to watch. Have manufacturers already set foot in Britain before filming? At least stepping in England ?? I do not think any British person has had such an accent other than a Royal Family comedy! Also with the two English boys ... well, I do not think any English boy has acted, spoken or dressed like any English boy in the history of the British nation since the pre-adolescent public appearances of Prince William and Harry. For American filmmakers .. There is more than one country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. meaning more of a culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but this was so bad that I could not watch. Fire looked cool though!
