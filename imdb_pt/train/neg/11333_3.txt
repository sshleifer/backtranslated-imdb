This movie sucks. Even though the directors claim to be part of this hi-culture, it's still a very, very bad debut in the direction. The topic itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and have never acted before but the worst thing about this movie are the very inexperienced and naive dialogues and directives. There is no time in this movie. I felt the directors were so excited about making that movie (it's the first feature), that they never really wondered, what story they want to tell. I've met Ben (one of the directors) on several occasions and he's a nice and considerate guy, but that does not make him a director. I think "American History X" is full of clichés, but somehow manages to convey a story. "Hi! Warning" is full of clichés, does not tell anything new or provocative and (-this is sad about this movie) is far from any Hi! -Reality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Strange but great German films, watch the films of Michael Haneke, Christoph Schlingensief, Oskar Roehler, Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel: <br /> <br /> Benny's Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Weisse Experiment Movie Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill ... <br /> <br /> *** out of ten, because of theme and photography
