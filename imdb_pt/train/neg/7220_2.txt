Where do they get the money to make movies like that? I mean, there's nothing redeeming about this movie. None of the actors are known, writing is terrible, photography is blurry, history wanders between being a bad version of Repo Man and a western nicklodeon and acting is unbelievable. For someone who watches all kinds of movies, good and bad, I must admit that this movie is the worst I've seen since the People's Eye Attack in the 1950's. I really do not like to ruin the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or, heaven forbid, art, but this movie seems to appeal to anyone. The story bends over a mystical contamination of a person who is a poor version of Alma Celta's eater, although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual tones. Bandits have to join with the good guys in a city where they are unable to escape. Take from there like that, unfortunately, it's the best part. My advice is that unless you have a bad mythology, an amateur writing, an unconvincing and tedious attitude, you'd better leave it on the shelf when you're renting videos.
