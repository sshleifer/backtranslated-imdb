As a casual Rolling Stones listener, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, since this movie is very 'your age' in the 1960s. For me (someone born in the 1980s) this just seems like a crappy hippie purist propaganda, but I'm sure that this movie was not made for me but for people who were active during the 60s. I expected drugs in abundance with the Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so much that I felt like I was working with them to come to a conclusion of this horrible movie. I have not seen any of the directors of other films, but I suspect they follow a similar style of direction, half "amateur", which gave a feel like the Eurotrash program, poorly run, poorly organized and no real entertainment value. My only good opinion about this is that I did not waste money on it, it came for free with a Sunday newspaper.
