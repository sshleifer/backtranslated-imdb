I saw this movie when it was released, and my dislike for it stayed with me all those years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal seems to be to get all the literary images of Tempest and make them literal. If a character says, "My heart takes flight," we would be shown a real human heart, with pigeon wings tied, tapping the screen. <br /> <br /> This process does some exuberant pictures, but in the end it is an easy exercise. And it becomes deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I do not regret the pleasure that other viewers have found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was ecstatic.
