This movie was on t.v the other day, and I did not like any of it. The first George from the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel .... completely horrible. The new actor and actress to play the lead roles was not good at all, they should have had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot her name), so this movie gets a 0 out of 10 rating, not a movie which you can sit back and watch and enjoy, this is a movie that you turn to another channel or takes you back to the store if it is hired or purchased. It was nice to see the monkey back, but it was not as fun as the first one, they should have had the new George as Georges' grown-up son, and they still had Bredon and (what's her face) in the movie, I was a little better then it was.
