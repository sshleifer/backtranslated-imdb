This movie is flawed on many fronts. Like many before, it portrays more of the poplar mythology than of history. Production is poor, giving the impression of a welfare project for many actors who might otherwise have worked at Hollywood Squares. That was the biggest flaw - I know the eras and generalities of the true protagonists of the Alamo and the geriatric group of TV actors chosen to portray them never leave any credible evidence to intrude. <br /> <br /> As a native Texan, I grew up with mythology. Later I learned more about the story. I can accept a decent production from any perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to take advantage of it. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life than this impassive mess, being only a little less precise. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid it.
