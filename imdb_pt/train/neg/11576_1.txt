I saw this at UCSB's noisy festival and I was shocked by the fact that I won the golden reel award. I was not the only one considering that the audience had mixed reactions to the play. I thought there were many other better films out there, but then I learned that the judges were strongly rooted within the area of ​​film theory and other crap. While cinematography and editing are on par with many other short films out there, the narrative is nothing more than your average student piece. It seems that "serious" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle and eventual suicide - Nick and Kate go to the police and include all three. Please be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and it may be the opinion of my stranger, but the face of the Montecito sounds a bit fake. Is anyone else like this?
