Some people have insisted on denying this film because they question the plausibility of blacks in the Wild West, Asian people in the Wild West, or armed women in the Wild West. Grab and read a book. There were some Asians (Chinese), there were some blacks (freed) and everyone outside the Gentile class had immediate access to weapons; is the second amendment you know. And, as far as the use of modern language is concerned, none of these Westerners are nostalgic about the language actually used and consistent with the represented era. The Americans had different accents, they used different inflections, they spoke at a very different pace and used many words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Do not blame historical imprecision for the fact that you simply do not dig it. Be honest. Maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you see.
