I watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling on her while zaping channels. <br /> <br /> I think we were both expecting some kind of beautiful happy family Christmas movie, but were extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the soldier seems to have any emotion, his face looks the same, if he is knocking down the Christmas tree, seeing the girl he loves being kissed by his boyfriend, or when he is fortunately surprised by the girl he loves, he is horrible actor, and in no time none of us did anything but laugh at him. <br /> <br /> So there is the beautiful blonde girl, blessed with the ability to count points and betray her boyfriend, who captures! and his ambition in life is to live with his parents and count more points. <br /> <br /> So it's basically a story about a guy with no emotion or feelings who falls in love with a guy who counts points and betrays his boyfriend, is as predictable as he is, and really a waste of time, you do not wins nothing by watching this, plus some strange laughs, because it's all so tacky. <br /> <br /> I love it when her father says he only eats French fries and not French wine, and everyone laughs, that's the hipster attitude that this movie is about, moreover, if my girlfriends daddy were sending me, I would say something or not, but not our veteran army, no sir, he lets everyone fix it. <br /> <br /> The film is what First Blood would have been if John Rambo were burned as the world's greatest coward.
