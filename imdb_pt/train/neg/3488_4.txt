Question: How does a bourgeois director treat a subject such as immigration? Answer: transforming it into a parable of existential alienation. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are back in the early 1990s, right after the disintegration of the Eastern bloc and the subsequent flood of immigrants into the European Union, and what better way to deal with the subject than to make a movie about an existentially alienated middle-class journalist, an existentially estranged upper-class politician, his richly existentially alienated wife, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the background, immigrants seek political asylum in an unidentified Greek village near borders. I think Angelopoulos can show some social awareness while dealing with the existentially problematic upper classes. Honestly, the scene where some high-ranking officer curses his fate because he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you vomit. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it can not be that bad. Angelopoulos is a master of film art after all, right? Wrong. It is at this point that his mannerisms begin to become very artificial, like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks appear: there are blurred windows, blurred lights, a strange wedding, a walk by the river, and people in yellow water jackets. Mastroianni also opens new avenues for the greatest numbness of all time. Avoid really. Go to your first movies.
