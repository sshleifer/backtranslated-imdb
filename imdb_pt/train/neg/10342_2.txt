Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most unbelievable couple on the screen since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. The direction of Larry Peerce oscillates uncontrollably between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly thinks it is the first and his egocentric performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry among the actors in the film. Usually, I do not like to leave myself so ascerbic, but The Bell Jar is one of my all time favorite books, and to see what they have done with it makes me literally crazy.
