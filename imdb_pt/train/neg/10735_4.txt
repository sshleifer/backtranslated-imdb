Maybe being a former Muscovite and having an elastic sense of humor keeps me from playing this movie in the 'arso / festival' trash can. It's not the biggest movie of 2005, nor is it complete trash. It just has many problems. I also honestly doubt that this film has been banned because of any "ideological fear," or "conservative taboos," or any other reason why this movie might be called "brave" and "inflexible" abroad. He was banned because censors knew that 99% of Russian film buffs would find him offensive because of the bad taste during filming and the editing of this tedious film. <br /> <br /> So we have a strong opening. shot. Wonderful sound design, excellent premise - loaded with meaning and symbolism. The use and placement of symbols consistently will be the strongest aspects of the film (not that the number 4 is a scary visual challenge). In the next 40 minutes, we have an equally strong setup. A fun and well written bar talk among the 3 (main?) Characters, and we feel the sentiment for these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and everything. Then the movie begins to slow down. We began to wonder what would happen to you. <br /> <br /> The rest is pretty boring, just put. Of course, the village guy pulls the heart strings, and there are a few slightly fun times. Good sound, of course. But the pleasure of this film, not to mention the plot, is seriously compromised by the problems of rhythm. And this, this lack of pay for sitting through all the abject misery and sadness, is what will ultimately make people angry about 'offensive' things. (In person, the main offensive scene was bound to be captivating, in that sense). If you want to watch a nice movie where the Russians are lost for long periods of time (the whole movie), watch Particulars of the National Hunt. Much more rewarding post-Soviet material. So yes, a 4 out of 10 for 4, good and symbolic of my post-mediocre movie condition.
