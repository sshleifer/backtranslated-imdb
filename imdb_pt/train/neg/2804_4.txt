I was probably spoiled for having seen the first 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation is a big disappointment. I did not get any chemistry between the two main stars. A lot of theatrical acting and it just does not do it for me, and that was all about putting Tim in the role of Rochester. The casting director has actually read the book. Very strange! He is a good actor, but Mr. Rochester, he definitely is not! And Zelah was just, well, odd, a mixed couple. In his favor, the supporting cast was very good and the Lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation, but overall it did not capture anything of the magic of the novel. He certainly would not ask anyone to see it as a true adaptation of the novel. A real disappointment!
