Decent animation and some functional character development keep this DreamWorks animated horse fable at least watchable ... however, it stays a bit slow and the story is a little silly. It is interesting to see a reversal of typical Indian cowboys and roles, but here it seems only a nod to political correctness rather than a proper plot decision. DEGREE: C
