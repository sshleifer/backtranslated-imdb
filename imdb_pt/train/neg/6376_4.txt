Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips of "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house she grew up in which she recently inherited from her deceased sister without the knowledge of her grandmother (Fay Dunaway), who is still living in it. Jennifer decides to sell him as she is in dire need of much money to grandma's heartbreak. She also begins to have uncomfortable recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. There was really nobody to relate to in this movie. Jennifer looked cold, distant, non-sentimental, and narcissistic, while her grandmother looked rancorous, sad, and also narcissistic. The film is good and well done, but without anyone to empathize, I found it difficult to care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My Note: C-
