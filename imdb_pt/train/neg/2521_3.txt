There are a lot of problems with this movie, but the point is that it tried to do a lot with very little. The base story is very good, but the money was not there to do justice to the story. The nonexistent budget actually killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) has written credit for 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office hit. However, this movie had some serious Disney cash backing. Honestly, this is a good example of when not to make a movie. If he had waited for a few more years, the technology would have made it cheaper to make many of the effects. (not to mention that he might have found a company with money.)
