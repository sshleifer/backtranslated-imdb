How 4 out of 16 previous voters gave this movie 10? How could more than half of previous voters give a 7 or higher? Who is voting here? I can only assume that it is mainly children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid; acting is difficult even to think of acting; the characters are without character; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In the sad event that is already rebroadcast, I suggest you read a book.
