OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting. So you put that baby on the DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. It should be a comedy. And I must admit, I laughed once about ten minutes before the end. This film has the following elements: a battered and beaten neighbor, a boring legal trial, racism, lynching and death talks and criminal arson. Hilary, right? No, please, if you never hear anyone's criticism, please do it here. You can not even force yourself to watch this crap. FILTH! I said that, CRAP! Whoever puts his name on it should sue.
