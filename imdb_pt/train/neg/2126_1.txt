Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor, but it is ridiculous to interpret him as a loving romantic leader. The fact that he dances so well, sings so effectively, and plays himself in the part so completely in some way just made it look even more scary. In his cutest moments (with the girl at the train station, in the final number with Rosie), I could not take my eyes off him, he was so repellent. You keep waiting for him to drop the cool guy and start growling. Vanessa Williams was the true star, the only performance that was better than the 1963 film. By the way, if you see a production of the stage musical, the 1963 film and this 1995 film, you will see three versions that have more revisions (different songs, same songs attributed to different characters and in different situations) than any other musical I've ever seen.
