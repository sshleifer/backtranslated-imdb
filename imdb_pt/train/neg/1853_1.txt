This film, uncorrected, THIS THING, this abysmal abomination of the fiery puddles of hell should have been killed before ever leaving the writer's head. I could not come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try anyway. Horrible, bad, nauseating, tasteless, crap, induction of vomit, harrowing, bad, hideous, nasty, rotten, there simply are not enough words in English! The "plot" involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man. Do not ask how, it's not important. The killer snowman runs killing people. How, you may ask, can a snowman kill someone? In bad taste ways you want to remove your eyes, if only so you do not have to endure that styrofoam doll anymore. In ways you want to fill your ears with warm wax so you do not have to endure your snow puns anymore. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it in sight! For the sake of your soul, do not watch!
