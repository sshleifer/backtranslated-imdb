I signed up for IMDb on IMDb for this movie. <br /> <br /> I just finished this movie, and the only thing that impressed me was that I had the willpower not to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a decent number of action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've ever seen in a movie. Most sword fighting involves irritating the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent is not doing the same. I have seen many student films with better action and stronger plot. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with little action and virtually no sign of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the film does not even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the princess and the farmboy / terrorist and her upset sister. The movie has several plot lines, and none of them are really worth anything. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may have been that I watched the dub, which was pretty bad. The whole cast mumbled all its lines, so it was difficult to keep track of what was happening. But I have the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you've heard of it being a futuristic / ninja action movie then you've heard it wrong. That's what I thought when I heard about it and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen to you. Stay well away from that.
