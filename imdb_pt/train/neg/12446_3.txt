I appreciate a positive thinking if you feel good about yourself movie, but that's too much. In the end, they look like a bunch of crazies. This movie is one of those thinking that you have plans for the '70s, I know the movie is made in 1980. Much more of Clint and girlfriend film. This movie is a 3/10.
