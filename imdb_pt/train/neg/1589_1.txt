It is unbelievable that a screenplay as clich√© and completely absurd could make any canvas, however small. The dialogue in this film makes Catwoman look like a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays the gauntlet of the tail, Elvis impersonating, gunslinger, martial arts mastermind who bets on the life of a former footballer who became a gambling addict, played by the winner of NBC's Next Action Star. Its performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way. The "movie" takes place in Las Vegas, and as people play poker, the writers thought it was the perfect setting for a movie that tries to survive 24 hours against a ubiquitous and wealthy player who offered the target $ 2.4 million if he can . Go through the day. And so the hunt follows. A hunting smelling of deadpan explosions, backyard construction scenarios, shoddy cinematography, and one-line phrases containing the word "bet" or "bet." The female winner is also thrown into the mix, but why I have no idea. Oh, but do not worry about "NAS" fans, the losers also make their entries memorable. The surprise ending will melt if you love predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should reevaluate his decision to sell even more. I wish he could give me those two hours of my life back.
