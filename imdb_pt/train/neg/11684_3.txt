This movie makes no sense at all, there are plot holes large enough to drive huge New York police vehicles. The characters do not act plausibly. I'll post my comments on the forum, but save time and money, this is stupid. I can not stand it when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses sophisticated editing and cool music, and does not bother to have a plot that fits into the most basic level. But it's nice to see Denzel W. prevail over the man, who comes in 3 flavors, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain Von Trapp. There's even a sweet kid with a video game that's cool.
