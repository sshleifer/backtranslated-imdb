* Some spoilers * This movie is sometimes subtitled "Life Everlasting". This is often taken as a reference for the final scene, but more accurately describes how dead and buried this previously estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical farewell. <br /> <br /> There's a "Hey kids, let's put on an air show" on this telemovie, which can be catchy on some points. Some fans will feel insiders, since they like to choose all the different appearances. Co-writer, co-producer Tom Fontana and his friends do things with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real Baltimore characters. <br /> <br /> This is at the top of the returns of just about every movie. members of the television cast show varied castings, their old favorites as well as non-favorite afterwards. <br /> <br /> There was always an executive producer Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and Tug-of-War. the rest of the creative team against budget-minded NBC executives who simply wanted another dumb cop like "Nash Bridges," who regularly beat "Homicide" in the ratings. The pressure counted as the show jumped between the fascinating realism that transcended its form, and dishonest sensationalism that diminished. Sadly for this film, Fontana, co-writers Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac simply threw in the towel. They took the most ridiculous story out of the series, headed off with an unlikely and artistically fruitless new plot, and put the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker members of the cast. <br /> <br /> In short, some time has passed since the last episode of the show. The former heart of the Baltimore homicide unit, Yaphet Kotto as Lieutenant Al Giardello, is now a candidate similar to Kurt Schmoke for mayor, and Schmoke himself makes an appearance. But this promising beginning of immediate and improbable takes a tragic course. <br /> <br /> The spotlight turns to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardello's son, Mike. A handsome man who did a good job elsewhere, Esposito was one of the handsome faces brought in late to supposedly liven up the TV series. But the question for viewers has always been: Is Mike as uncomfortable as Gee's son, or is Esposito so uncomfortable on paper? <br /> <br /> To be fair, Esposito does not have the chance to interpret the main story. no interruptions. This is because writers choose this moment to relive another plot that spit on the intelligence of loyal program voters. <br /> <br /> An apparent snuff streaming video was promoted, and then it seemed to happen on the Internet. After some red herring, the detectives arrested a suspicious repellent. But the harassed and overworked state deputy of Zaljko Ivanek forgot to file motions in time, and the suspect was released, only to be assassinated later. Let's summarize: he forgot to record the paperwork because it was not the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire Maryland legislature, the Attorney General USA, NBC, TV Court, BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times London, The Economist, The Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World did not call every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the old gang of detectives and associates returns to Baltimore to help. There are a variety of talents on display. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogs to be distributed, some of them are only on display. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally underutilized, while time wasted on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on commercials. The writers seem to satirize this by introducing Jason Priestley as the latest detective. On the other hand, they give Michelle Forbes a very affectionate scene easy and easy to follow. <br /> <br /> There is another malicious cast, with current lieutenant Gary D'Addario, the center of the book that spawned the show, playing another detective. Guests arrive from other shows, such as Whitney Allen making her impassive "Miss Sally" from the children's show loved by the inmates of Fontana's "Oz." Dina Napoli, from WBAL TV, appears as herself. <br /> <br /> Even when entertaining, however, these guests may be distracted. Ed Begley Jr. actually advances the story in his brief appearance, playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich of St. Elsewhere in Fontana. He is still a vivid character and fits into a hospital setting. So you remember, was not St. Elegius turned out to be an autistic boy fantasy? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy. This film was made when Court TV bought the rights to re-run the series. This network contributed to the legal renegade Helen Lucaitis, who interviewed the Homicide team and then appeared in "Oz." The TV correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news, that is, plot points for the latecomers. <br /> <br /> Although she is so thin that she disappears when she turns to the side, Lucaitis also manipulates some physical comedy with Esposito. He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than any of his usual colleagues. Maybe these two have done a spin-off. <br /> <br /> As the film ends, the cream of the cast rises to the top. Although they are overloaded with a loser script, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor outdo that. His performances remind viewers of what made Homicide, for considerable lengths, the best show on the air and one of the best television productions of all time. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see the best professionals do their thing; It's a pity that this movie does not give them more chances. Stubborn fans may want to watch this movie, but you can live without it.
