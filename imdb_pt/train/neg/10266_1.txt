1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Re-over-the-top of the supposed horror films of the 70's like Friday the 13th (versions 1 to anything ??). I can not think of much rescue here except (or can I think of something?) The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio show a year after some children were killed in the woods as a "tribute" . for this, supposedly. But, behold, one of the stupid people has connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the murdered people (again, how stupid of her to be part of it). Guess what? The killer is back and we are warned from the start who he is (so any mystery is past). And besides all that, where are the 'cops' and why does not someone call them. I can not believe this movie was financed by someone and done. You might think that by now the American people would have been judged a bit higher, at least in their cinematic experience, but not so much by this filmmaker.
