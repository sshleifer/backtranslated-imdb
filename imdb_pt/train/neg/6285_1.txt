Horror Movie ?? really ???? I can not believe how bad this movie was, what is the purpose of this movie ??? the movie almost 1h and 30 min and the first 70 minutes of it, it's just lena walking with that stupid look on her face after she had an accident .... not much talking, not even much action .. I have to say tho , the last 20 minuets that has little small action .. and was still stupid ....... and in the end oh my god I do not know where to start, also end up looking stupid in lena face lol .. no Lena Headey, I think she's a great actress, but I do not know what gave her to make this movie .. do not waste your time and watching because this movie has no story, no acting ... and it makes no sense ... not to mention how slow this movie is and it feels like you're watching forever.
