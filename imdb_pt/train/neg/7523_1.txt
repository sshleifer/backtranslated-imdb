Once again I took a chance and rented this trash bag. Announced as a horror movie, there was not one scene, not one, that was remotely scary. NONE!! Of course there was some nudity, but all the lesbian action got a little old. I think maybe it was supposed to be the saving grace of this movie? And Dan, what a stupid bag! From the beginning, I knew I was on the way when good old Dan spoke for the first time. And should he be intimidating? What a laugh !! All in all, this movie is horribly awful! How the hell are movies like this made? If you want a movie with some emotions, do not rent this one. This movie is as exciting as the Teletubbies.
