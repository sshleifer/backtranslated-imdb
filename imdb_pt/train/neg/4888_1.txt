Nick Millard, also known as Nick Phillips, should have left well enough alone when he did "Criminally Insane" 10 years before the release of this waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" was less than an hour long should have given him clues about the fact that he had probably ordered this plot for all he was going to get ... but instead he chose to use TONS of footage from the original as well, to the point of recycling the initial sequence of credit! Unfortunately, bringing back the rapid aging of Priscilla Alden did not save this. The little bit of original footage in this movie seems to have been filmed with a rented handheld camcorder! If this movie cost more than $ 100, I would be very surprised and would be equally surprised if it came close to that amount! Avoid this one and note the original!
