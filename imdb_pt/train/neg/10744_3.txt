In the first, they were mostly giant rats, but there were also some wasps and a giant chicken. This, however, is only a period of giant rats, giant rats and a really growing boy. This is about this growing kid and a scientist who is trying to help you, so he accidentally creates giant killing rats ... you know how it is. This movie has a few deaths and its moments, but I think it's on par with the original, I just prefer some variety in my movies of giant creatures. Well, that's not true ... I really like "Ants Empire", maybe I just do not care about the giant rodents. After all, it's a rather monotonous movie, although it has a rather strange turn of events in this sequel to a dream that is truly bizarre. I just can not recommend this.
