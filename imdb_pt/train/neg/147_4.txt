"Valentine" is another horror movie that can be added to the list of stalk and slash movies (think "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer"). Certainly not as good as the movies I've listed, but it's better than most of the movies that came out after the first "Friday the 13th" movie. One of those films was the 1981 Canadian "My Bloody Valentine", which I hated a lot. "Valentine" is a better movie than this, but it's not saying much. The plot: a young nerd is provoked by two colleagues at the beginning of the film. Then the movie moves years later, when all of these classmates grew up, and then are eliminated one by one. It is presumed that the murderer is the boy now all grown up for revenge. But is it? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" has a compelling cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but a dull script does not really do them justice. There are some scary moments everywhere, though. <br /> <br /> (of four)
