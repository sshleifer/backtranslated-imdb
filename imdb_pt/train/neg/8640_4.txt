I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here. It was quite easy to watch (at 3pm). He had a good cast - the role of Kevin Dillon of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both chacrafista and chilling. The rest of the main characters also was not so bad. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspense movie. A couple can not conceive, so they go to a fertility clinic for help. A sociopathic "genetic material" giver sets the recipients and, in the typical form of persecutor, interferes in their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the film was pretty good ... we see "Conan" growing increasingly obsessed with raising her baby and creating the perfect family with her mother. Of course things do not work out for him the way he planned. It's not a bad plot. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just horrible. I am very tolerant of movies (especially at 3 AM!) .. but, I was amazed at how bad the ending was written. I actually mocked the outloud! <br /> <br /> All in all, it was not the worst movie I've seen, but I would not be able to sit down again (unless I skipped the end). The only redeeming quality here was the role of Kevin Dillon - one of the best serial killers of all time. <br /> <br /> Try to take a look at the other channels before watching. try it
