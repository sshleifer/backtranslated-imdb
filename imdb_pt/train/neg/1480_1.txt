He pulled the brave folks his ass! This is a parody, right ?! No one really writes that this happens as awfully improvised improvisation. I think anyway. This movie should be a parody because who would say that wrote this script in another way. One can imagine the entire cast sitting while the director and the screenwriters analyze the storyboard. <br /> <br /> The director says, "Then our inbred villain uses his 24-inch machete to gut our scary and symbolic neighbor. will pull the guts out of your bunghole "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! "All the cast proclaims. <br /> <br /> No way it can happen, no one writes this stupid! It has to be a parody. <br /> <br /> I loved the part where the skinny introspective girl beats in the fucking freak of death with the cast-iron frying pan she finds on the floor of the cave.I was not sure if the types of consanguineous cannibals bothered to cook a lot.Maybe that explains why the frying pan was on the floor in the dark, at the right time to kill the malformed hulk.It seems ironic that after the weird guy has beaten pornographic queens specializing in martial arts and a couple of door type, he falls so easily into the skillet of a defenseless girl next door. <br /> <br /> What the hell is this Richard Greco guy doing this? <br /> <br /> Did he fire his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain the ending to me, please, because I did not get it? I can understand why the good heroine wanted to kill the cute little girl who was making tea for her. No matter, I do not care.
