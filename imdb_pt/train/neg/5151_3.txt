I thought it was a great idea, but, boy, it was badly executed. We have a broad notion of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are, but there are virtually no details about how a show works. Producers do not seem to have found a way to tell a story or give the viewer a "straight line." (Which is not to say that they did not try, but to have the stage assistants report a synopsis of the Ring cycle, since the program narrative tells us nothing about the work of physically assembling an opera. > <br /> We see many things happening, but little is said about what people are doing and why. There is little notion of who is who or how the various production departments fit together and work together. For example, we often hear of a problem - it is expected, then, that the problem and its consequences and / or how it is resolved. But instead, filmmakers usually cut to something else (usually, pretty generic images of people pushing things or talking into headphones). <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie ends up looking like another pastiche of images you see running under the final credits of a show, rather than anything worth observing on its own merit.
