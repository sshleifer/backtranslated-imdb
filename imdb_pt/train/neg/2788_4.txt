Much has been written about Purple Rain, the apparent "quin-essential" bio film musician, however I am here to tell you what the film does not deserve is a great compliment. <br /> <br /> First of all let's start One thing is straight Prince is a great musician and music is the only area where Purple Rain excels. Even the score is fascinating, and if this was filmed purely as a concert film, it would be a great experience, unfortunately it is not, and as such the film has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all is the horrendous acting / writing, the character of Prince "The Kid" must seem like a mysterious solitary kind of few words, but unfortunately this sounds like tacky and incensable. A good solitary character should at least have a few moments of conversation, unfortunately Prince's character rarely has a few more words of dialogue in the film and it's hard to believe that he would get the girl that way. It all seems a little out of here, which is a shame because you can say that this is a character who is terribly in conflict and lives a very complicated life but we are never allowed to enter it. <br /> <br /> An amazing aspect of this movie is how much of that happens in concert. The lives of Prince and Morris seem to play a minor role in the performances here, which I think makes sense from a business standpoint, but it's exhausting to have a 2-hour movie where apparently half happens on stage, especially when the stories of background of the character So to summarize: this is not a very good movie.
