This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and turned the world's attention to what little remains of "Wild Western Canada". When Archie began to write his stories for the newspapers; the thought of the day was to tame the desert and to convert / absorb the peoples of the First Nation. <br /> <br /> The movie advances and asks the question; why would a well-educated and obviously talented Englishman become an Indian? Archie, as an English boy dreams of becoming something, but capturing the full meaning of this dream is unique and invaluable - no matter what. Sounds like a famous puppet story, does not it? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I've seen Archie become my living image of the "Indian cigar," a very wooden and unreal character - very well done by Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian on the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness and reality did not come true until he met and married his wife, Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would take him ahead of the English world scene, not like himself, but Gray Owl - a Canadian native of the desert frontier. <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie to becoming the noble wild prototype. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Mr. Brosnan as well as the directors is well done. I watched documentaries about Gray Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection. Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie going to meet the Grand Council of Chiefs were a great moment in the movie. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful scenery of Canadian Lake and real "Gray Owl" sites. <br /> <br />
