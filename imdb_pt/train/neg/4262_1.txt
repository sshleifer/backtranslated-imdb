This is simply the worst movie I've ever seen. It ranges from 2 hours or more, and the art of the box was totally misleading. My friends and I rented it because we thought it would be a poor man of 300 years. You know, laugh and make fun of. No. There's nothing funny about this movie, just pain. So the movie starts, and they're talking some kind of different language. We think, "Oh, it's just the beginning." But no, from there the film falls and becomes more like a super annoying book you had to read in school, where nothing happens literally for hours, and the battle scenes rival those of two children fighting on a playground. Omit Cinematography, and this film belongs to the trash compactor. Movies like this will lead to the world we see on Wall-E, which by the way was a good movie.
