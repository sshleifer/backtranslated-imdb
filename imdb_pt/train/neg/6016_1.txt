This movie, which was released directly on video, should contain a warning that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom. It is yet another religious film of "ecstasy" that is little veiled and evangelising, with the good guys (the believers) suddenly disappearing and the villains (the non-believers) being left behind. It's an interesting concept, especially since we see it happen on a non-believer flight that is having a sinful affair with a stewardess on board (needless to say, the sinner does not disappear either!). Unfortunately, with all pilots being non-believers, the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully finished. While this may have been interesting without the heavy religious intimidation as a whole, the heavyweight film gags, the acting is horrible and the simulations, obviously computer-generated, are very false. In addition, it is another film filmed in Canada that claims to be the city of New York. Spare me ... I'll just read the Bible.
