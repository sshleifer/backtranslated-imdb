After a series of power outages at a remote island zoo, genetically manipulated saber-tigers are at the disposal of the island's residents. Dude, the fictional channel made some bad "original" movies, but I think this could be the worst so far! This ill-written and directed arrangement "Jurassic Park" offers all the usual cliches (mad scientists who think that people killed by monsters are "expendable losses," characters who walk down long dark corridors alone, teenage characters with brain death that only work in the film is to die a horrible death, etc.), and, unsurprisingly, without any suspense. The special effects are atrocious - the puppets' heads in close-ups of the title beasts are bad enough, looking like rigid plush dolls, but the CGI - which makes computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with Dinosaurs" look realistic by comparison , are simply terrible. There is a bit of blood, but most of it seems very unconvincing. Oh, and the scene of the scientist's death in the end is really one of the worst things I've seen in years. I could not even laugh it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, this is simply bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting trivia for you ?? this movie lent music tips from the 2003 science fiction movie "Alien Hunter," which was far superior to this crap.
