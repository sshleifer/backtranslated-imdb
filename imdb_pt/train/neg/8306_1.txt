ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention, she will probably grow psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy. Now poor rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a recluse and said, "I want to be alone." How much does ET have to do with this little girl? Does ET have nothing better to report? I bet there are many people who do not really care about the color of their birthday cake and balloons. By the way, I've never heard Anna Nichole have won any of these lawsuits because of the will and her inheritance. Who's paying for Larry's, Howard's and little Dannielynn's lifestyle? Could it be ET?
