The only thing that "An Inconvenient Truth" proves is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "uncontested" experts are not challenged because a response to their fictitious hypotheses is generally below real science. This is mainly people of false science. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - are people, we exhale, and unless you're willing to start sacrificing your brothers to save the world, there's nothing to be done. We have heard how the world would end up as a result of man for over 50 years. Fools publish a timeline for their doomsday and when time passes, nothing happened. "An Inconvenient Truth" is just another vehicle with which an insincere faction of American society can sell its poop. <br /> <br /> And as for Al leaving the tobacco business because of his sister's cancer death, that's a burden too. Al could not run his farm better than he could run the country. He was losing money with the operation because he did not mind cultivating when he could make more money on touring lectures. The only uncontested global warming is the hot air produced by this gasbag!
