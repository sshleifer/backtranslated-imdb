If I accidentally stumble in this script in textual form, I would read and maybe laugh. I would not laugh, though, at the points in the movie where the director seems to want me to laugh. Although I'm still not sure where they are. I do not care if this is Woody Allen, this writer can not write dialogues, or at least he can not intentionally write dialogues, then draw performances of actors capable of laughing even the most delicate clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I am an art historian, I am looking for a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, so claim the fact, but honestly, do you know any art historian who would say that? How would you respond? <br /> <br /> "Really? An art gallery? Who would have thought of that?" <br /> <br /> The whole script is filled with the sort of tasteless quasi-intellectualism I did not expect from such a respected character writer. I admit that I am not aware of Allen's other work and, judging by this, I do not want to start learning. Are the characters disgusting, without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really really poor character writing? You are the judge.
