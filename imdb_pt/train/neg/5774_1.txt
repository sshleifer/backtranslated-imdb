This film is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of so much more than this movie. Get on the bus while seemingly anti-racist, doing nothing more than berating the whites and degrading the black status quo. The plot of this film is about a group of black men traveling on a bus to the march of millions of Louis Farrakhan's men. The bus has all sorts of people you could imagine: gay, muslim, gangbanger and Uncle Tom (He gets thrown off the bus though). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of being racist the minute he got on the bus to drive. Although he was a Jew and the fact that he explained the situation, he ended up being racist and leaving the bus. I hate to say it, but movies like this need to account for their own hypocrisy and rienforcation of stereotypes. This should not be seen as a triumph but a sad disappointment. You may think I'm a racist for writing this, but I mean well. Better luck next time Spike.
