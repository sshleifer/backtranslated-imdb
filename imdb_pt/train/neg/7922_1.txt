In a distant Galaxy is a planet called Ceta. Your natives love cats. But the dog people wage wars against these feline and loving people and have no choice but to go to earth and grind people for food. This is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie I've ever seen. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the low standard already established in previous films. It's like he's enjoying playing in a Limbo celluloid game. How low can he go? The only losers on the set are the US. Mr. Mikels and his silly mustache actually have people who STILL buy this crap. <br /> <br /> My Note: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Comments from Ted Mikels; the story behind the making of (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds behind-the-scenes; Filmography by Ted Mikels; and "The Worm Eaters", "Girl in Gold Boots", "The Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women", "Blood Orgy of the Devils" and "The Corpse Grinders"
