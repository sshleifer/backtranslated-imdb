"Houseboat Horror" is often considered the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical horror movie, which led to the "See the movie that can not get an Oscar" promotion. An underground disco band begins to die cut by burned maniac as they are trying to record a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Badly acted and written slasher film with zero suspense and annoying characters.It certainly provides the blood : the heads are split in half with a machete, throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe. If you like cheese slasher movies you can try this, but you have been warned. At least it is better than swedish "The Bleeder".
