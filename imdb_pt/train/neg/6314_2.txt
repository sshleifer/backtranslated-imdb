I love Seth Green. His appearances on the 70's show are always worth watching, but last night I felt the show needed to be overhauled. Four single boys inherit an apartment in New York City by which most of us would die. Grandmother must have been an heiress to have that space first. So I felt that the need for realism should have been brought. Anyway, the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable. I would have been thrilled if they had to live with one of their parents, which would have provided great humor and dysfunction in relation to the set up of the show. There did not seem to be much humor in it. I'm just watching because it drops before My Name is Earl winning on a Thursday night. I think they should come back, undo this series and start over. We need more family sets involved. How about Seth and his friends live with their crazy parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place. They could have Dabney Coleman as father and Christine Estabrook, play the dysfunctional mother and siblings. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network is exploding.
