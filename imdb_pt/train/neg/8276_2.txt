I knew this movie would not be awesome, but I thought I'd give it a try. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought I had potential. Unfortunately, much of the dialogue in the movie was very fake and tacky. I think Aquafresh gave some money for the production of the movie because they were dropping some tips. There is a shot in which the sign of Aquafresh stands out in you and you can not help but notice. Maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how often we can leave Aquafresh products in the movie without people getting bored. The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it in the movies.
