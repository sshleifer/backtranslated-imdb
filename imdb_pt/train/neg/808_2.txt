Extremely disappointing film based on James Michener's novel. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was the performance of Marlon Brando. His southern accent was ridiculous. I caught myself laughing when he spoke when he sounded like an old lady from the south coming home to rest. Brando, so good at the previous films, just laughed. Tyrone Power, in "Witness for the Prosecution," should have been nominated for a better actor instead of Brando here. <br /> <br /> The film, which deals with racism, dealt with the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between American soldiers. and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando got the face of stone throughout the film. His change from anti-these relationships to a pro occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and conversations made it difficult to see how he could embrace such new visions. <br /> <br /> Only the Lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received the Oscars for their performances. Nothing about any performance was equally impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of everything being portrayed by her. A better performance in this film was made by Miiko Taka, who did well as Brando's love interest. She showed great emotion as the anti-American found love with the character Brando. Her face was engraved with her unhappiness in losing her father and brother in World War II. She realized that her dance was not her exit from this existence she was living. Martha Scott went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in "The Ten Commandments" to the intolerant mother of Brando's love interest at first. His performance along with that of Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens, as Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.
