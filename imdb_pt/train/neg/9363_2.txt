This movie has some fatal flaws, as someone can walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable. So this same person just walks through the facility and walks into Dr.'s office, it's just a bad writing or a bad edit. <br /> <br /> Film very, very, very predictable. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this movie was made except that it was filmed in Canada and probably received a government grant. <br /> <br /> I must say that the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> Unless you're really bored and there's nothing left to watch on television, then I'd say It will kill some time, but on the other hand, it's a movie that no actor would like to have on your curriculum.
