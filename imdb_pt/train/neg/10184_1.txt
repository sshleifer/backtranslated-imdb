For months I've been hearing about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute as so many novice directors make films that combine creative ideas from other people to create their own premise of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, any of the millions of Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all these directors want is a foot inside the Hollywood gate then they are doing the right thing and they should continue because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes movies. How many times have you heard the phrase "It's Animal House Finds Back to the Future"; "It's Wall Street meets the Society of the Dead Poets"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant original and bold, unsafe and predictable.
