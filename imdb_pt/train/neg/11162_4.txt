Jack Black is a boring character. This is an annoying indie film for 14 year olds. Do I have to write another eight lines? Ana de la Reguera is good to see, as a Mexican nun who withstands enough forward and rude advances of Jack Black. This film is a PG 13 version of an indie film. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore the Mexican culture. This film explores deeply the Mexican culture. I just choke on your cultural rudeness: Jack Black is so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary in Mexican culture, so to speak. The Mexican culture of wrestling is not the clearest place a white guy, like me, could look for. I suspect that Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black. presented here. <br /> <br /> I think the IMDb changed my review.Has anyone else had your review changed too? Just one question.
