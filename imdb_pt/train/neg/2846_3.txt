What a terrible movie that is. The only reason you would want to go through this mess is Miss Eleniak's pleasant sight. Mr. McNamara's painful demonstration, which at times became embarrassing, ruined what might have been a reasonable movie if the right actors had been chosen. Mr. McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor he obviously wants to be.
