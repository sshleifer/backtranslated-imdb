I saw this movie in its debut at Sundance 09. As American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes of Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of countless movies I've seen in nearly a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I've ever wanted to leave early. The worst problem with Towelhead is that it obviously originates from a collection of "provocative" concepts about cultural stereotypes rather than an organic human drama. The script derives from the novel of the same name of Alicia Erian. Edith Wharton's famous quotation comes to mind: I never knew a novel that was good enough to be good, although it was adapted to the author's political views. This observation is especially devastating to Towelhead because his political views are so obsolete and simplistic. If there had been a time when the white villains of Towelhead, patronizing portraits of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were new, it has passed. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed analysis, please look for any of the many professional evaluations available online. Almost everyone misjudges this film and exposes the superficial and manipulative fabric on which it is based. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem more easily cheated. When reading reviews on this and other similar sites, you'll often find superlatives: "dazzling," "breathtaking," "deep," "shocking" ... It embarrasses me to read them, but do not surprise me . In fact, I have met many people who seem to consider any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as profoundly moving, thought-provoking, and profoundly discerning. If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely pass this.
