I realize it's not to be BSG and I can handle slow-paced shows if they are interesting, but I feel completely disinterested and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Thriller + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> The formula for Caprica seems to be: Drama without grace + > <br /> Maybe it gets more interesting, but from episode 3 I can hardly watch it. Actually, it's at the end of my watch list for the week. This is a sad state of affairs. The Syfi channel really destroyed its schedule on Friday night. What happened to the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday nights? They had a good thing there.
