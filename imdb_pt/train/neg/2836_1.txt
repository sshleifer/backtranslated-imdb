I saw this obvious schlock festival on a video store shelf. And before I got my first videocassette, I figured I'd christen this little gem and it's a bad movie, in the best of scenarios! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inadvertently hilarious. And contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicably. And much like Christopher Walken seemed to want to star in all the bad movies in his later years. This movie is Country Quinn's Bears. <br /> <br /> He features lines like: "Shut up and let me fight !!!" <br /> <br /> And "You're saying too much shit!" <br /> <br /> And the invaluable return: "Unfortunately it's sh_it, sh_it brave and hard!" <br /> <br /> You'll be impressed by a fight scene as Bo makes a SOMMERSAULT through a pool table! And make a good kung fu kick when it comes from the roll! Chop socky action and T and A thrill !!! <br /> <br /> What could the schlock movie fan ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and comes back to haunt Bo like a ghost, she asks why he killed himself instead of dealing with his debilitating illness? He says, "Real men do not eat quiche." <br /> <br /> Ah, aaa, yes. If Bo was a smart cookie, she would call an exorcist right there!
