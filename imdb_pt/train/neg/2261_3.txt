The RINGMASTER star Jerry Springer as a TV presenter named Jerry, but it's not the JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, your guests are trailer trash, but not the trailer trash you see on the JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, they attack each other but not like in ..... What's the point of making a movie about the JERRY SPRINGER show and pretending it's not the JERRY SPRINGER SHOW? And besides, this is a very annoying movie.
