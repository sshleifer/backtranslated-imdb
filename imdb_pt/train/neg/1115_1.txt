We saw this on the shelf of the local video store, we saw "Coppola" in the credits and we were excited. That was the only time this movie sparked any interest. I could never figure out if it was an attempt at a humor movie that failed miserably, or an attempt at a serious movie that failed miserably. In general, the whole production seemed unbelievably aristocratic. The sound in particular was absolutely terrible, especially in the scenes filmed in the small bar; the dialogue was so mushy in parts that it was unbelievable. Very disappointing.
