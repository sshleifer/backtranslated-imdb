... of this horrible movie! There are so many things wrong with this movie, acting, writing, directing, editing, etc. that it's amazing that something hits the top and proves to be the absolute worst. The music! I noticed that the film has two composers listed. This should be the reason why each frame has music, from the worst D-movie style drivel. They have never heard of the expression "less is more". It was so painful to hear, I changed the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so good. You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they did not see roles like this in the twilight of their careers. See at your own risk.
