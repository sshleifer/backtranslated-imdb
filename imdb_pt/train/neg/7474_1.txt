This program did not do that for me, even though I'm a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene that was not dominated by the main character. That made it a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the show was over. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my review there, since I'm not a movie critic, however, the IMDb status guidelines state that you should put 10 comment lines. It reminded me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in all the scenes, and I hope the writers of this program can employ a little more diversity to engage with viewers. I do not doubt the talent of any cast and crew, it's just that after watching things like "the wire," I come to expect great things from the police drama.
