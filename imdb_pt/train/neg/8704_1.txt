I usually like dinosaur movies, but this one is just crap. No script, no dialogue, no acting. And the brave Colonel Rance trying to show that he is tough and so bowing his mouth resembles a twin brother, the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So this was a complete waste of time (fortunately, no waste of money as I watched the movie on TV). And I really can not understand 7 people who rated this sh * t 10. They must have joked. My advice, if you see this title run out of it!
