This is a Japanese movie, but there is a bit of English also spoken here. It's a beautiful movie with pleasing visuals, with the scenic beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, that was the only quality left for me. The story was usually boring. Who wants to watch a young woman with 90% of the film because her "photo" husband is much older than he advertised it to be? Sure, this can be a bummer ... but get over it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes does she twist and cling to him. Until then, for most viewers, it was too late. We fell asleep then.
