It was all that it is not: it had rhythm, pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the scene. It also had a decent script. This made me scratch my head. If Farrah is not really "serious" about a career, why does she have a manager (and why is he wasting her time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists," why do they subscribe to The Mother of All Jiggle Shows (as in the movie "Brady Bunch," in which Robert Reed wants to make Shakespeare, just to meet up at BB)? They were not industry names, but they were not starving either. And while they set the story (the poster was released before Farrah did the show), Silverman rejected the pitches of "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Spelling promising his little girl Tori one day he will create a show for her obviously did not happen. <br /> <br /> What bothered me was how Spelling's role is distorted. He is shown as the show-runner and creator when he was none. And how it "pops up" with the "idea" for CA was laughable! <br /> <br /> How was Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral contract when the others were signed? And why Farrah or Bernstein did not tell them that she was leaving not because she discovered her Inner Diva, but because the Majors wanted her? That's why, when she tries to create conflicts and tensions by putting Farrah as the "bad girl" (as Suzanne Somers), she fails because the base was never placed - that's where the "Three's Company" photo was delivered.
