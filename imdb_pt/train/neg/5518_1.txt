I have not seen this, and I do not intend to see this movie or any other that includes Lindsay ...... unless & even "poor rich girl" straightens his life for a period of 2 years beginning with her recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> <br /> In fact, I do not know anyone who has gone to see ANY recent Lindsay movie. I'd rather imagine that 2007 will be the highlight of her film career until she clears up her act. All of the recent publicity only hindered her film career if she has more aspirations to make more movies. <br /> <br /> So far, filmmakers have actively sought Lindsay for roles in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to go to auditions and really compete for any role. Her reputation is currently "poisonous" and quite possible, it could have a negative effect on ticket sales at any box office she is in. <br /> <br /> Sooooo ... now Lindsay will have to deal with "not being wanted" ..... will she be able to handle it? <br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno will want to have Lindsay back on his TV show? <br /> <br /> All that precedes is merely my OPINION. I do not have inside information.
