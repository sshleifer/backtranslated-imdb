Michael Jackson would have claimed a place for the top-billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD, and because he loves children. That did not work (and why should it?), So we have Eddie Murphy to save the world by rescuing "Kid Midas". I strongly suggest to all future screenwriters that they please thoroughly study the actor's futile dialogues in this quirky fantasy-adventure comedy that is one step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does may be more appreciated, but do not misunderstand me about his exquisite comedic talent; he does not belong to this film, and so has DR. DOLITTLE! Combined violence and visuals are grounds for stamping it as a cult camp classic, and that would not have made any sense since Hollywood fanatics and movies continued to profit from the guy. Speaking of visuals, they were attracted surprisingly well at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame. Murphy is much better at getting to America and 48 HRS, but this obsolete film is not my touch of golden honey for a sweet crispy taste.
