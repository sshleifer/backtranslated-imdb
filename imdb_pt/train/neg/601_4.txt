!!!!! OF COURSE THERE ARE SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a screenwriting workshop avoiding clichés in horror movies: Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks down the villain - Check Heroin does not notice the villain recovering unconscious - Check Frame So we see that someone sent this list of cliches to a movie studio instead of using it for class. My dear, oh dear, if only the London transport were as regular as the cliches appearing here. In fact, there are so many cliches and we've seen this before all the time, that no one thought of going into detail about what the eponymous creep is or how long it's killing people underground. I am led to believe that it is the result of some human experiment and it may not be until that night that he decided to take revenge on mankind, but all this is so vague to the point of not having felt Do not be totally negative I doubt very much if the Os producers thought they would be making a movie that would sweep the Oscars that year and there is always a market for horror films. Likewise, I doubt it was too costly to produce and had an eye on the DVD market instead of the film distribution, and I will declare it a little better than DEATH LINE, 1972, which also featured a murderous cannibal hidden in the London subway. it's just that when you think all the cliches were used in this movie, another cliché appears to lift your ugly head
