I mean, I thought I heard that dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that I can not believe it. I was laughing so much of what must have been the worst writing and acting in the history of mankind, I was seriously worried that I could have a heart attack and die right there in the theater. <br /> <br /> So this is the scene I'm talking about, the "hero" just watched his brother hit and his brothers car exploded right there just a few feet away from him (the hero). The "hero" was playing the expected "fit" to see something so tragic and people were trying to stop him from running into the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the midst of his attack and his uncontrollable / emotional rage breaking he says "I'm so sad" - he said it right? I'm crazy?
