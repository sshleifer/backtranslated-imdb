Prequel very disappointing for the first two films, has none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second. Concentrating on the guys who 'race' the cube, this basically takes away any sense of tension inside the cube, since we just do not care about the characters inside it. Much of the film is simply boring, and only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the wacky green-eyed marine. After that, however, it only descends into unintentional hilarity. The end is adequate, tying it back to the first in an indirect way. The script is terrible, the performance mediocre at best, and the direction blank. A much smaller follow up.
