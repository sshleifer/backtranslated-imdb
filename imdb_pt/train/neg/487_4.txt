What did the director think? Everyone who read the biography of Artemisia is impressed with his courage to face a public trial of rape in Renaissance times and even suffer torture to show that Tassi was guilty. This fact shows the true independence and emancipation - in its most terrible hour it is with its MAN. Why do the films portraying the Renaissance have to be so beautiful and romantic in the clinic, are we afraid to see the dark side of life or the mood of Hollywood's happy happiness? Although I always advocate the freedom of a director to create his own reality in a film, I can not understand the life story of Artimisia. Choose very disappointing by the creators of this film.
