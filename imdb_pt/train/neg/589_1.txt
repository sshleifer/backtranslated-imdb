Honestly, I went to see the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the plot, but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be placed in this category. Believe me, being a freak in the movies, I've seen many brutal movies in my life (Ichi, the murderer, irreversible, Hellraiser), but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I've ever seen. The plot is simply stupid, the direction is horrible, the acting was mediocre, even the song was a cheap copy of the so-called "Horror Soundtracks." There is not a single smart aspect throughout the movie, and some of the scenes are really hard to bear. (especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cry - awful). I can not understand why the film was rated 16 in Germany, where normally the criteria are really difficult (eg kill-bill (brutal, but made grace of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and beyond a magnificent direction ) even a movie as state of grace is classified as 18). No one can call it a horror movie, because it was actually more about showing gore than scaring the audience (showing the "creep" face in the middle of the movie was a bad decision); for me (sorry for my expression) is just an insane director living his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence, which has absolutely nothing to do with the plot or explains anything. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialogue is annoying, honestly I can not mention a single positive aspect of the film except for the British and Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> If I had something to say, I banish this movie from the theaters, I completely understand why none of the big producers invested their money in that crap. <br /> <br /> I am eager to receive feedback for my topic and I would be happy to discuss one topic or another. <br /> <br /> "Livin 'the dream baby, living the dream" David Aames
