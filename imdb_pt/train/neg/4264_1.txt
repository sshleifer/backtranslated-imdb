this movie definitely disappointed me. It was a great concept that was ruined with a horrible script. The story simply did not flow and was disjointed at best. There were so many elements to this story that were not explained, or were forced in without any real thought. elements such as the love story could have been expanded a bit more, and the cannons need to be written better. every growing main character needed more information about the training he was getting and less on his feet. everyone likes a good story of "boys overcomes" and this turned out promising, but with the script failures it was not. Despite having some pyrotechnics in the final sequence of the battle, it was lackluster due to lack of choreography. this made for an annoyingly boring clock <br /> <br /> could have been so good :(
