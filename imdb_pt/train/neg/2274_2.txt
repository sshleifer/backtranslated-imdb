Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love movies so I have to watch those raw movies in theaters. And I expected Vanilla Sky to be good. I was hoping they could keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same, or they would make their own. Well, it happened to be a bit of both, and it sucked. <br /> <br /> It started well. I love Radiohead. I wish there were more of that. But in the end we're hearing Good Vibrations by the Beach Boys. Talk about a wide range of sucking in between. They had one or two good songs at the club and maybe a couple of others, but why, why did they have to call GV during the climax? It was more annoying than confused or brazen. Especially when it has nothing to do with the plot. At least put some meaning behind the songs. Kid A = primary. Whatever it is. <br /> <br /> He also did a great job on the club scene. It was cool. Otherwise, the movie was a great ball of arrogance. As if the audience received the film. Those who managed to read subtitles, and the rest did not. It's that simple. The motivations were all spoiled. I did not understand Diaz's motivations (had not they done the chicken soup night before?) And some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay in the sea. Tom Cruise can not act (especially on those types of films [ie Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. Got it. Either way, they tried to improve on the original with a bad American rock soundtrack and bad angles and good movie and brilliant rendering and would have helped if Crowe had not spoiled everything. <br /> 2/10 Big disappointment.
