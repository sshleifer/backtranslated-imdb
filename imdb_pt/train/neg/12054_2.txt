"What happens when you give the homeless $ 100,000?" As if, in asking that question, they were somehow morally acquitted of what would eventually happen. The creators of "Reversal of Fortune" try to get their voyeuristic laughs as they disguise their antics as some kind of responsible social experience. <br /> <br /> They get Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he's going to change his life. Then, with only the most superficial guidance and counseling, they let you follow your happy path. <br /> <br /> What are they trying to say? "Money can not buy you happiness?" "Are the homeless homeless because they deserve to be?" Or how about, "Raise a man - it's more fun to watch him fall from a higher altitude." They grabbed a man with nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then watched him pouring everything down the drain. Should this be entertainment? They wear this with some dark songs and dramatic camera shots, but in the end they have all the high morale of car crash videos - only this time they designed the car crashes and asked, "What happens when you take a break board?"
