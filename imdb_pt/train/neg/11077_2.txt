The only reason I chose to give this film a chance was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is that it was the biggest waste of a good actor that was filmed. As far as I could tell, Borgnine was the only actor in it. The other performances were so terribly awful that it surprises me that a studio really paid the "artists" to show up. Bring this level of talent to the acting department with such a tedious and insipid story that I thought my eyes would start bleeding when the credits ended and you had a perfect cinematic disaster. Obviously, the film was meant to appeal to a children's audience, and to their credit, it was better than most of the original Disney Channel programming and similar networks geared toward children. But honestly, that's not saying much.
