This seems to be one of those movies that we thought we would like, but I did not like it. He seemed to be trying very hard to be "artistic." All in flash, without content. It has some beautiful scenes, and any one of them is cool to watch, but bring them all together and it becomes a chore just to sit down. I rented this because of the brilliant reviews in the video box and the fact that I am a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit pretentious and sometimes boring.
