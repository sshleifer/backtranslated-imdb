OMG! The only reason I'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis-in-the-box. Also, how did this decent mean made a sign to make such a weak movie? It might have seemed like a good idea at the time ... There are no laughs to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, most of the blame is probably on the director, Joel Zwick. It brings nothing but flat performances from everyone involved. Do not waste your time as I did; but then, I like a good train accident. Wow, now the system is telling me that I need more lines - here you go: This movie must be called return to sender. Ok, now this was funnier than anything in the movie ...
