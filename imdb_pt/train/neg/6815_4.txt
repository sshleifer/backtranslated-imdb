The eight film by Jean Rollin that I watched is also possibly the strangest; the intriguing plot (as it is) initially seems to be too fragile to sustain up to its 84 minutes, but somehow manages to get cluttered in disorder as it progresses! An aspiring vampire (with little clothing, as promised by the title) is held captive within a remote chateau and emerges only to "feast" on the blood of voluntary victims (who are apparently members of a suicidal club) sure where all this would take him, the writer-director finally has the human villain? in fact, the eccentric father of the blank-faced hero? ridiculously revealed as a mutant (?!) of the future! The languid rhythm and dreamy atmosphere (cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical of both the filmmaker (idem on the seashore in the climax) and the Euro-Cult style "as well as the bunch of nubile beauties on display. Personally, the most enjoyable thing about the visually appealing but intellectually empty visual whole was watching familiar actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in the last six films of Luis Bunuel) pop up confusedly through him from time to time!
