It's like the other Dracula movies always do, Dracula's servants always on Dracula's side, which disappointed me in the end. Regardless of whether the person wants to be a vampire or not, I would like to see something like the first movie the lackey fights against his master. It's very interesting (since you can almost predict how the story goes) than just the priest or D. winning the game (we need some amazing scenarios!).
