If you like the original SNL cast and show, avoid this movie at all costs. When this first came out my friends and I waited in line for over an hour to get into a sold out cinema. In the middle of the movie, the theater was 3/4 empty. We refused to leave thinking it would look better. When the movie was over, we were the only ones left in the theater. The film lasted only one day in all cinemas and disappeared from view. In interviews with "Mr. Mike", he declined to comment on this movie. The film was an internal joke about the SNL episodes that came out shortly after the release and closing of the movies in a day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and email for a refund but were totally ignored.
