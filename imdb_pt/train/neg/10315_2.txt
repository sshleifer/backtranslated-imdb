I can not believe people thought this pile of junk was funny. By changing the moods between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There is something about Mary' leaves little reason to stay to the end. Of course, Cameron Diaz is very beautiful, but that will never be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller goes to great lengths to work on the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the film is a loser. At no time, none of the scenes were believable. The shots were badly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making movies at all costs. I check the IMDB to see what they are working on, so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; the bonus is the only time he smiles. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it, too. The next day, we saw 'Rush Hour' and ridiculed ourselves as fools. This movie just stank.
