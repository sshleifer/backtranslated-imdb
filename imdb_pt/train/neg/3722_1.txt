I remember being forced (yes - literally FORCED) to see this movie of a Southern Baptist preacher when I was a kid, and yet I loved his horror. It is designed to scare the poor suckers into being "saved". The only thing that "saved me" was the fact that it was finally over and I could go out and have a REAL life. <br /> <br /> Check out the chapter on this movie in Sarah Diamond's book "The Politics of the Christian Right." FASCINATING. And certainly more interesting than the movie!
