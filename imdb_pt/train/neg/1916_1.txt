This movie is totally crap. Some stupid intellectual comforting himself by doing all he could to claim aristocrat superiority over the working class. Nothing more than a piece of catharsis of self-indulgence. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this kind of movie is set in the US, it sure will be a big joke. And simply because it leaves the "other side", it becomes a masterpiece, a wonderful diversion for certain brainwashing westerns and / or brainwashing (some George W. perhaps :). A typical Cold War sequel, some kind of joke anyway. I would say, if this - as expressed in this film - is all that the Soviet intellectuals have thought of all these years, then maybe they deserve all the miseries they say they have gone through. BUT NOT! Because, like many others, I have read and observed true masterpieces made by prominent Soviet intellectuals. For example, something also relevant to the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - the book of Gavriil Troyepolsky and the film of Stanislav Rostotsky - is a true masterpiece. Real life, true tragedy, true sadness, true pride and dignity, one of the best of the Soviet era.
