Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in his mouth blowing the back of his head out of boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of a "death and death" rock band who could not shake off the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect of her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet in the head) . She returns, however, possessing the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her friend who will replace her on vocals so the group can finish the album interrupted by Cassidy's untimely death. But, Cassidy made a deal with the dark and souls will be collected. She is consumed by this rage primarily by Neal, but all band members or anyone inside the music studio dies when they are victims of whom they believe to be one. Instead, Dora ... no Cassidy returning for payment. <br /> <br /> A low-budget horror movie looks cheap, has an inexpensive cast that should make plans on another line of work, and features cheap death scenes that are not easy. is a little effective.
