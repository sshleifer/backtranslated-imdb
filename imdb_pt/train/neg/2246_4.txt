I've never seen the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so I have no means of comparison. Besides, it's been a few years, but I found this tale neither thrilling nor its captivating novel. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are going in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn and disillusioned rock star in decline, embarking on a romance with a new and talented singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. His dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline. The main actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are appropriate in their roles, but neither the chemistry nor the plot has left much of me. The film is noteworthy to me by just one aspect, Streisand's beautiful rendition of the Oscar-winning song 'Evergreen'. She really has a powerful and magnificent voice.
