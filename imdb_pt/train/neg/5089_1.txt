It is so sad that the Romanian public is still inhabited by vulgar and uneducated individuals who enjoy this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the series "Garcea" or the children's play "Vacanta mare" ... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other sub-craftsmen never intend to claim their shows as "art". Pintilie, who for 40 years has made a very good film ("Duminicä la ora sase") followed by another, good enough ("Reconstituirea"), tries to declare his feature films "masterpieces" - but unfortunately he masters at a very limited level, the specifically cinematographic means of expression. As such, "Niki Ardelean" again offers a sample of "HOW NOT" - this being on its sole merit.
