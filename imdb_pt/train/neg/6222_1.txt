I'm not sure if users should be allowed to review the movies after sitting in half, but I'm afraid I can not last another minute. <br /> <br /> If this sorry excuse for a movie no I do not have the big late GP spinning like a wheel on your grave, so I doubt anything will. <br /> <br /> The excellent review above of 'Not A Movie For Parsons' fans sums up most of my feelings. How dare a director and writer (second-rate) try something they are so clearly unable to deliver. What were they thinking? Where to start? <br /> <br /> THE SCRIPT: I thought I'd be getting a bittersweet American slice. What I got was a badly executed clownish with no clich√© left over. Stupid Hippy? Checks. Fat cop idiot? Checks. Terrible plot inventions? Checks. Embarrassingly written female characters? Double check. Total disrespect for the story you're trying to portray? Check. <br /> <br /> After a while, you realize that what you are watching is a soap and not very well written. Dinner with Knoxville. Scene with ex girlfriend. Scene with Knoxville that has not changed much. Scene with ex girlfriend who was a bit like the last. And so on ... <br /> <br /> ORIENTATION: My friends and I decided, after some considerations, that watching this was like watching a bad episode of Quincy, or perhaps a particularly poor Duke of Hazzard . That's how bad the direction was. Terrible leaping cuts, awful camera work, ins and awkward clumsy to scenes. God, it was horrible. And then I discovered that the director was an Irishman who is more noteworthy recent work is a bad Sunday night BBC drama called Monarch of the Glen (trust me, it's the lowest common denominator TV). And then it all made sense ... <br /> <br /> ATTENTION: Are we now so critical that when a random TV guy decides to take a chance, if he's not so bad, he stinks, we applaud his efforts? Knoxville JUST ABOUT can go through all the scenes. Poor Christina A. is not so lucky. Your performance is a car accident (although what you do with these lines, I do not know). The hippy in the hearse: oh baby, oh baby, oh baby. Did not we move on from Cheech and Chong? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you understand me. What I would say is that, as other reviews have mentioned, no one in this movie clearly gives a shit about The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers or Gram's solo work. They knew nothing about the American road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent history of rock mythology. This film was shallow, failed to exploit anything and was jaw-dropping from the beginning to ... ah, wait, I have not come to an end. And I suggest you stay away too.
