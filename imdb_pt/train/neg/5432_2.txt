A warship is sinking ... Their survivors, hung on a nearby life raft, sit there doing nothing as we enter each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Although the name of Noel Coward is the only one you notice during the credits, everything that is cinematic is because of the Lean. And in technical terms, it's very good. David Lean just KNEW movies from the beginning. There are many moments when Coward's studied dialogue occupies a second seat and the visual sense of Lean takes center stage. Try the soldiers leaving the ship near the end and all that scene; the trail shot toward the corner of the anthem, the scene in which we are inside a house that is bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It is all wood, displaying no emotion, character or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he is not really listening to what the other artist is saying, he is just waiting for them to finish so he can rush his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <BR> <BR> It's episodic, a little repetitive, and flashbacks overwhelm the story: there's no central story that they advance, just give insight into the characters. Still, it's an interesting movie worth watching - and a good debut for Lean. It's not a very deep or penetrating film, and it's definitely an advertisement film, but it's also a showcase for Lean's editing skills - it's all about how the pieces are put together.
