I'm not sure why I clicked on "contains spoiler," because honestly, there is not enough explanation in the movie to know enough about what must be going on to spoil it. <br /> <br /> Visually, mainly, delivery. Well, besides some reminiscent rubber mask monsters from the 80's. I'll say now that before watching this I had never seen the Lordi band, nor knew anything about them that they won the Eurovision. Apparently, the monsters are members of the band, practically on their stage characters. Whatever. Anyway, I did not know this while watching. I just thought the monsters / demons were mostly passable. Virtually. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure there's a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but in fact it may be better not to know that. It would probably have been incredibly idiotic to think about it. The action continues to roll quite well enough to keep the viewer entertained, even if half the entertainment factor is playing around with the fact that wtf is happening exactly in that movie. <br /> <br /> I gave him four mainly because I have a good laugh, especially how this explains virtually nothing. It must have been the mood I was in, but I found it funny for some reason. So I look at the movie on the internet and discover that NOBODY knows what the hell he should be. It amused me even more, and increased my score by half a point, to 4/10. <br /> <br /> It is not scary, nor particularly coherent, but is very good visually and sonorously. Overall, far from essential, but watchable. Do not expect too much and do not expect it to make any sense and can entertain you if you're in the mood.
