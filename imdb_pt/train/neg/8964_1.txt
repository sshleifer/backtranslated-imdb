Those familiar with the two previous Cube films know very well what to expect: a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of trapped rooms, paranoia, bad acting ... This is a little different. About half of the movie happens out of the cube, where we can observe people watching people inside the cube (or at least five of them). <br /> <br /> I think Cube Zero aspires to explain what the cube deal is, but you really can not know much more than what was covered in the first two movies. Of course, there's a kind of explanation there, but it's very ridiculous compared to what was suggested in the first film. The Cube Zero looks quite cheap (just like its predecessors), and the fact that it shows more than just a few empty rooms only emphasizes that feeling. I was also quite confident to say that there is no risk that any of the actors will win rewards in the foreseeable future. They brought back the traps of Cube 1 (by that I mean they are almost the same, which is a bit of shame). <br /> <br /> I know many people kind of appreciate this movie and its ties to the first but I feel it is a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that was not so good to begin with.
