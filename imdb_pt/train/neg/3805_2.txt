Err ... this movie sucks. VERY. <br /> <br /> I have read some of the other reviews. Apparently, there are many people who think that whatever Woody Allen writes or stars is automatically good ... <br /> <br /> I watched a number of his films, hoping that I was missing out on something. But no, they just suck. Poorly written garbage. The characters are all very stereotyped (not to mention a little stupid). The plot is ... I think it's mysterious. I'm not sure about that. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, in any other movie you've seen of him. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Woody Allen, go see this movie. If you are under 50, do not bother. (If you're a Woody Allen fan And you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical. I do not know what to say.)
