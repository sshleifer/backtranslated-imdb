Where to begin? This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The editing is the worst of all, the sound effects were terrible and the sound editing was damaged. Most of the movie that everyone can have here is the bad effects, with confusing conversations in the background. I had to turn my volume in full blast just for her what was happening ... and what exactly am I supposed to hear? Probably one of the worst scripts ever made. I can not believe people really put a little green for this movie. It makes me think I could take a piece of crap in a box, send it to the producers and then get them to fund a movie for me. Dolph, it was common, Dolph. Nothing more needs to be said. The villains were bad, the protagonists were bad and the movie was stinky. If you really want to know what NOT to do when writing, directing, or editing a movie, watch it!
