This completely defeats me because Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as an "intellectual" filmmaker and polemicist. It is hard to believe that Godard really believed in everything that is Marxist and Maoist. Anyone with half the brain could solve the bankruptcy of these 'isms' and how many people they destroyed and continued to destroy, even when Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: would you have boring listeners reading boring political diatribes in your audience, and then when you could not think of anything else to do, you would put up another narration about the first voice that had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a movie with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; not you? It was the only guarantee of getting such irrational bullshit in the first place: the Stones genius eclipsing an untalented political idiot and chattering away with a camera. The bookstore scene was not worthy even of the worst marginal theater, and it was an insult to the intelligence of even the little children who were accustomed to touching it-as could be readily seen. Copping-out, allowing friendly critics to claim that all this nonsense crap was a satire on conventional filmmaking is no more than a safe outlet to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his public. It is ironic that Godard's great friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, has made the best film about the film production of all time, and Godard did his worst with Le Mepris! By chance, Godard did not choose the Stones Sympathy trail with the Devil. Turns out it was the track they were working on when the 'movie' started filming at Barnes Olympic Studios.
