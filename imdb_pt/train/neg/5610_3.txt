This documentary begins with an interesting premise - it makes an intriguing and compelling argument that the story of Jesus, as commonly believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, after we prepare for it, the film changes completely and becomes little more than an uninterrupted attack on Christianity, concentrating rather on the easy targets. The writer / director clearly has some problems with the Church (he is an ex-evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger) and this movie seems to be his way of deliverance. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the film is disappointing.
