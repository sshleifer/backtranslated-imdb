A very bad attempt on a young spinal. At least the music at the lumbar puncture was good. <br /> <br /> This is really a very sad case of Hollywood nepotism in the worst case. A bunch of Hollywood executives, musicians and bad producers create a "poop" program so their kids can be in the limelight. Oh, please !!! The potty mood was really bad. I hate these things when you have really incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors and artists) out there bursting their asses to succeed and that crap pops up. <br /> <br /> Help you all !!!! Why was not Gene Simmons in it? Ameriac's taste in entertainment is going to the bathroom.
