Well, I like to be honest with all the audience I bought because of the sex scenes of Kira, but unfortunately I have not seen much of them. All of the sex scenes were short and randomly done along with all the weird, tacky background music as well as all the other B movies - it just does not look like much with two people having sex. There's a small piece of plot to the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Wow!!! how shocking !!! Why do not we name this movie for the Oscars? I can not imagine how bad the movie would look if it were R-rated (Mine is imported from the UK, rated 18). Conclusion? Get down and leave, then you will not end up being an idiot like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
