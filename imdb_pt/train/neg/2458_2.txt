I can not describe how terrible this movie is. Am I the only one here who finds his way totally disgusting? Rohan's Men look 100% fake with their badly colored hair, which does not even come close to matching the actors' looks. The orcs looked terrible. Why is Gandalf bad? Why can not they pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others who sounded like awful pronunciation of Tolkien characters. Everyone and everyone are glad that the studio that did this removed the plug from the sequence, it was just a terrible terrible adaptation. Go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better drawing of Tolkien's work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 2/10
