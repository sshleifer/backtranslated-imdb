"Paula, I may be a bitch, but I'll never be boring!" <br /> <br /> A hilarious line in a skin film that, on the contrary, is a bit tiring and has beautiful honey on Stacey Walker, but that's all. This girl is a real tease who draws her boyfriends, co-workers and even her lesbian roommate Paula to her room, but then turns into a madman who cries "rape" and calls the police! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this certified history is interesting for perhaps a little, but this story ends up turning into a real repeating case of a note. At least the end is worth the wait, for those who still care about it.
