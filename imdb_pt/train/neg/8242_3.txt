After seeing FIVE THROUGH THE EYES, I have to be honest ... I just did not like it. I had read so many good reviews about this movie, but I just did not get where these reviews came from, I have plenty of time for the newcomers in filmmaking, and I'm sure the directors would do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem, there were two cameras used throughout the film (which was fine), but they looked like really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you have all these girls screaming and screaming at the same time, all talking about each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're saying. Good idea, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car and then left, shortly after they were chased by the car they hit, driven by a crazy woman, who wants to kill them and has many chances to do that! ... and on the other hand the girls have many chances to escape, but no! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just went through it!
