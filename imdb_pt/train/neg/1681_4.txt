Freeway Killer, is a madman who shoots people on the road while screaming a lot of mystical corner on a car phone. Police believe he is a random killer, but Sunny, the blond heroine, played by Darlanne Fluegel, detects a pattern. The same goes for the former cop, played by James Russo, and they join forces and bodies in the quest for the villain who broke up their spouses. Also starring Richard Belzer, this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases, but in fact not a good movie, check out if you are really bored and have seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride, or Breakdown, otherwise stay away from the road.
