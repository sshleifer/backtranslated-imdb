This has to be the most retarded, stupid, and retarded monster movie of all time. It's a complete joke that this has appeared in theaters. It's like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be played in a bathroom and completely overlooked. John Carradine, shame on you. The people involved in this garbage pile need to be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I'm giving them a lot of credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before filming. How else can anyone explain the sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains? Do not waste a minute of your life watching this. Do not waste time sending a comment.
