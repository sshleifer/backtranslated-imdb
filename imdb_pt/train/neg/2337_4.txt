I do not know what the hype is about it ... This is really a bad movie ... it did not do anything for me, the only down scene is where everyone gets together at the party, and good music is playing, uplifting beat and good cinematographic pictures that make you move ... that was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise, this movie does not have everything to suck the viewer There is no story, there is nothing to think like some people say, there is not cohesion between the film different stories ... it was yet another attempt to redo Anderson's "Magnolia" which was brilliant but flawlessly fails ... Okay, it's light and easy to watch, but it's also movie movies. Maybe first write a story before making a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've ever seen
