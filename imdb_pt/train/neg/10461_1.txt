Interesting to read comments from viewers about the Omega Code ... many of the incredibly positive comments have been raised almost word for word from the TBN broadcasts ... the film seems to have been made to go directly to the video, to be stocked beyond the three. - part of the series of rapturas that was made by some other religious group in the 70's ... do not you remember? You will not remember this in a year or two. This is the first movie I've ever seen where it was implied that it was his religious duty to go to him and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... this only serves to show that if you are the son of a televangelist, you can also be a top-notch Hollywood producer with the tithing money of lil ladies ...
