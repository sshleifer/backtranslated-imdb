I kind of liked the movie despite the frenetic pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North. Definitely NOT the North of Montana and never will be. Americans wonder why they are considered arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one of the reasons. Stop teaching America's children that they own the planet. This centrist worldview is not becoming one of the great nations of the world. Even in jest. I would never refer to the US as "South Alberta". Walt would never let us down, so why start now? Also, the film was very silly, better luck next time.
