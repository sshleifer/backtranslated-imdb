I'm Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentaries I've seen of any kind. You can see that people are ignorant. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Ricans because they are descendants of Puerto Ricans, but probably know less than others who are not from there. You can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves. If you would like to see a real and genuine documentary from Puerto Rico, then you should see "My Puerto Rico". It's a serious and real documentary. It's not like this piece of crap. Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself. I thought it was to be about the Puerto Ricans. They keep repeating, I did not know. Well, that's the only thing they got right on that documentary call. I hate to see such garbage being made using the island's name. This reduces standards.
