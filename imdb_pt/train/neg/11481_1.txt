If they could have Ed Asner, why did not they catch other actors instead of people going to the same church as the producers? And why did the protagonist throw the wise and wise character on the ground when he was never in danger? He forced the old man to mask the injury out of pride, and so the young man would feel guilty, leaving him with a lifelong disability. I think that's why the main character refuses the money and why the old man works with him like a dog, even when he volunteers for the extra work. If the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is a long-distance boyfriend, then why is a soldier better? He has good reason to be jealous, good reason to drive her away from her hometown and a protective and controlling parent. All the characters that are meant to be friendly are not and everyone is the "bad boyfriend". How did they get to know each other anyway, a wine broker and a sawmill worker?
