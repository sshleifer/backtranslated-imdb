Awwww ... yes, it's comforting and all that an unfortunate family is adopted by ABC / Sears and has their house "renovated". That is where the humanistic appeal ends. I liked that early on, but now this show has become disgustingly excessive. <br /> <br /> Ten needy families can receive relatively luxurious homes with many treats for every family that every episode of this show boasts. . People in Habitat For Humanity should be shaking their heads in disbelief. For example, is it necessary for a healthy sixteen-year-old to have a jacuzzi in his room, or his bed to be fooled by the "Low Rider" hydraulics? Does the mother really need her old, dilapidated, run-down, rusted, restored and polished truck by some of California's best personalisers? A new one would have done the job very well, and probably for a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five-inch plasma screen in every room of the house? And then there is the question of who pays the increase in taxes on property and utility bills. Even after the zaniacs on "Makeover" leave, someone still makes a living. I doubt that Social Service friends see the humor of all this generosity. <br /> <br /> This program is nothing more than an assessment of ABC, and a tacit commercial for its sponsors.
