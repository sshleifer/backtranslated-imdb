We went to the movies with a group because the piece we were going through was canceled. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies of all time. It's not that I do not like cult movies I do. But nothing happens in the movie. You do not feel any connection with the characters. endless times without dialogue. And the car How do they carry a huge tent and chairs and clothes for every day in that car? It's a two seat! I have to say that the setting is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have done a photo shoot of the movie so that we could skip about 80 minutes worthless time without anything happening anyway. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it as it is a waste of your time
