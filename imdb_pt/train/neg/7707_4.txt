With a title like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!", Anyone entering this thing would be expecting: a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy mocking bad science fiction movies. It's supposed to be a mix of both, with a dose of parody scattered. Unfortunately, it falls very soon. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I realize this, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? I found just a few of the funny jokes or situations (ie the side-by-side phone conversations, the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereal, Superman walking by Lois, etc.). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but it does not. A cult classic is a film so different that only a select group of people understands it (or a similar description). "Attack of the Assassin Tomatoes" can be enjoyed by any 8-year-old child with a poor sense of humor, so it does not qualify as a cult film. <br /> <br /> There's a good actress in the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a clumsy and awkward reporter, but has a catchy personality, loves to overdo it and is a natural comedian. Unfortunately, it is misused here. "Assassin's Tomato Attack" is not as funny as, say, "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Frito" Movie, but I do not have a few hilarious moments, so I'd still recommend watching it once. Avoid the cut of the director, he has interruptions from the producer of the film and some supposedly "lost" scenes dubbed in an African dialect (can be found in English on the tape out of series).
