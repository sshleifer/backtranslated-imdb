This movie was slower then Molasses in January ... in Alaska. The man who placed the image in the preview should receive a prize for being able to put each of the 30 seconds that were entering the preview. I had to wake up with the people I was watching, several times. After it was over, I felt bad for waking them up. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is taken with the hope that something will actually happen, but nothing happens. It was easy to lose track of people's motives, and the characters were flat and uninterrupted. At the end of the movie, you expected everyone to die. Everyone runs around being despicable, stingy or pitiful, and usually all three. <br /> <br /> And worse, we watched a minute or two of the added features, just for fun and laughter that you understand, and all we saw was people being arrested about how socially conscious they are. If they had spent time in the movie they did by patting their backs, it might be worth watching. <br /> <br /> I was brought waiting for the thrill of '24. I have a lecture on social awareness through the sandman's slender eyes.
