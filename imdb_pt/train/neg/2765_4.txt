As this movie was made with a supposed budget of $ 70 million and without being completely redone is beyond me. Plot and dialogue are beyond amateurism. Characters say things no real person would say and almost never react to things that have been said before. No one seems to be anchored in the real world. Lead performance is good, since writing is so bad ... but a lot of supporting roles really drag production down. The hero's hair probably should have received its own credit, it was so strangely flashy of attention ... not to mention that it gave one of the best performances in the photo. Finally, for a movie about LA being surrounded by giant reptiles, this movie is shockingly annoying. What a pity! If you see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking of ways you could have done the SFX scenes and built a much better movie around you. Unfortunately, it would not have taken much.
