Wow, what can I say about this movie? It sucks. I'm surprised it was rated as high as it was. What is wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: what's not wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just crap and clich√©. Here you are very well about what it is ... A little nerdy kid, no friends, gets caught, dies and comes back like a scarecrow of revenge. "Everything" is packed in 86 minutes worthless film. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time watching. Also, the second one is not much better so do not bother watching it ... I rated this movie as a three because I liked the scarecrow costume, not because there was something good in the movie. I think you got the picture.
