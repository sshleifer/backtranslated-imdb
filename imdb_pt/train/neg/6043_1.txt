you should be watching my comments on many films under Evren Buyruk .. I'm off to make another comment about a movie that is not worth a minute of talk though .. This movie is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking himself - almost literally - die. The only surprise in this movie is that you do not have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was just a sad and sad loss of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this movie was just sucked. Slow does not make the movie bad, it was bad. The sketched plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic details is not cohesively drawn together in a significant way to a plot except to highlight a few gore that is illustrated from various perspectives, finally in the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, put me to sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - which was even more disappointing). I usually do not like to make negative comments or opinions about the work of others, even when they suck, but this movie guarantees a movie. . It's a shame these great actors have been embarrassed by this end result.
