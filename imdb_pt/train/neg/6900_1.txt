I just sat in the theater bored as hell, I wanted to get out in the middle of the movie. The plot is simple 4 Samoan guys shipwrecked weddings. So they have to bring dates to enter the wedding. To yawn. <br /> <br /> What bothered me most were the so-called gross jokes ... They were highly baseless, clich√©d and played in your face, to make you enter the already embarrassing movie. The acting was below average and I felt that this movie kept talking about nothing but a lot of bland jokes and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> All in all, one of the worst movies I've seen since 2006, dull, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank god a friend yelled at me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
