I can not believe this movie came to the video, and that the video stores are willing to put it on their shelves. I literally asked for a refund. Take away the fact that the film has no historical truth, and is still the worst movie ever found in a video store. Not good enough to be called a B rating movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing the horrible voice and music made me sick. Anyone involved with this movie must be taken out of the union, it gives the industry a black mark, but after watching most of that movie I really do not think anyone involved is a union member.
