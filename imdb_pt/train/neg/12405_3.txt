The shame of it! There I was, comfortable in the armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, excited in the hope of another splendid evening of Muppets' entertainment. What I won? Disappointed! How can the Muppets go from the sublime Christmas Carol to that? The mood was awful, the songs were worse than Country and Western (and that's something) and the plot was as confusing and poor as the Blind Pew. I think the main problem was that they bit much on Treasure Island's attempt. A short tale, like Christmas Carol, is perfect because you can weave the Muppet jinks high around it .... here the need to drag the storyline along has stopped all the fun. Where will the Muppets go next? How about Muppets Wizard of Oz?
