This movie received the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film of 1990. In recent weeks, I have seen dozens of nominees and winners of this award for the last 30 years and I really think this movie may be the worst of them all - yet , was not just a candidate. Has won!! I suppose 1989 must have been just a horrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like the super-thin Uncle Festers. Simple hinged figures appear that are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on its back. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, like that by magic, in space. Each has a pole and its also a box on the platform. The platform begins to tilt slightly and in response the men move in an effort to balance the platform. This continues and continues for a longer time. The only relief from this boredom is when one of them acts pretty unpleasant at the end, but that is not enough to make it fun to watch at a minimum. In addition to passable stop motion animation, this short does not offer anything of interest to me .... NOTHING. <br /> <br /> By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why I was not among the nominees. It was a LARGE short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the previous year. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years has resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny that it seems almost criminal to ignore him. Pixar could not get in? This seems unlikely.
