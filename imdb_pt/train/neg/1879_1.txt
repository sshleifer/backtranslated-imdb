It's hard to believe this is a sequel to Henry Fool. Hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comical, Fay Grim is slow, boring and not going anywhere. Where did the wit go? I'm disconcerted. <br /> <br /> It's been 10 years since I've seen Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. This is not the fault of the actors, who are good (Parker Posey) or big (Jeff Goldblum) - it's entirely the plot's fault, the dialogue and even the filming (the low budget is no excuse). A big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you liked this movie, you might not like Henry Fool so much ... the two films have absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the personalities of the characters ... it's all a scam to attract Henry Fool fans to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> I'm changing that now - Henry in some kind of prison with a Taliban?!?!
