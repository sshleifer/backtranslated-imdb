This is possibly the worst fencing film, sword fighting, ever done. This is not only because the so-called sports fencing is bad, but because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to play a semi-naked sex scene and later supposedly dance in group around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose it holds the public's interest. What a waste of talent from F. Murray Abraham. You're best served with exaggerated buck movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer, I recognize the near-impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport in the movie, but if it does, it has to have newer, better-designed characters and a deeper storyline.
