You have to hand him over to Steven Seagal: Whatever his other shortcomings, he has good taste in women. If you choose a Seagal movie, there will probably be one or more very beautiful women in it. And generally, they do not act as mere eye drops; they engage in action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" features the Ciera Payton duo (who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones, and finds time to wrap them in a catfight and a bit of lesbian caresses ! And if it seems like I'm spending a lot of time talking about them, it's because the rest of the film, though passable, is so uninteresting that it's hard to find much else to talk about. Ironically, the weaker aspect is probably Seagal himself, who can not seem to bother trying to pretend to care. Being this a type of military action, there is very little fighting in him, and he does not fit his role (a stealth fighter pilot, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking .
