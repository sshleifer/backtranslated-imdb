I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget this movie ... for the wrong reasons. This movie is supposed to be funny, it's not even a single laugh in the theater (maybe to josé garcia and gérard Depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. Sometimes it was difficult to understand what they were saying. They just speak fast and do not open enough for us to understand. I was with a friend and over 4 or 5 times I caught myself saying after a line it should be funny "what, what he said", and I'm French. I hate to say that, considering the fact that I think good films are made here, but I apologize in advance for all the foreigners who will see the film (if they ever show outside of France). <br /> <br /> It's deeply sad for this cr @ p. 2/10
