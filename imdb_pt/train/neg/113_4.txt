Today I found "They All Laughed" on VHS for sale at a rental. It was a very old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on the cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy. I searched IMDb and the User Rating 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked at "Mick Martin and Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Wow ?? four stars! So I decided that I could not waste any more time and see right away. In fact, I just watched "They All Laughed" and I found a very boring and overrated movie. The characters are poorly developed and I spent many minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes that fall in love with the women who are chasing), but I did not laugh over the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as a handsome and very seductive man, with women falling in love with him as if she were a Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the biggest attractions are certainly the presence of Playboy in the center and companion of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband after the release of the film, and whose life was shown in "Star 80" and "Death of a Centerfold: Dorothy Stratten "; the incredible beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, even fifty-two-year-old Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo", by Roberto Carlos. Although I do not like it, Roberto Carlos is the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60's and is called by his fans of "The King". I will keep this movie in my collection just because of these attractions (mostly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Much Laughter and Much Joy" ("Many Laughter and Much Happiness")
