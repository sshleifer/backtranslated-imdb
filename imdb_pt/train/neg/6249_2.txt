(r # 97) There's one good thing about this poor man's Pokémon (do what you want): the opening theme. It has to be the coolest theme song of any Japanese anime TV show made for the consumer-oops-I-want-to-tell-the-fans-carelessly dubbed. Unfortunately there was need to add some kind of show after the opening theme. And they simply could not come up with anything more interesting than people arguing out loud about which cards are better than the others' cards. Freud would have a picnic, unfortunately I can not imagine why children would want to attend a show where the dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the run time. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your wretched Pyramid Diamond Animal in a single blow! Do not you see that you have no chance to win this battle, you idiot?" HAHAHAHHAHHAHA! I'm about to use my Delta Times Pie card from Destruction Force, which eradicates each of its Munchers and makes its Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom destroys all the useless Significance Attack! I bet you did not see that coming! <br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they do in this show, say.Which in another show of low quality kids I used to watch, that is, the commercial Pokémon phenomenon (pity for every soccer pet mother), at least the monsters had the courtesy to fight from time to time, "Yu-Gi-Oh" is just in the calm words of critic A Orange Clockwork, by Roger Ebert, "clear and boring." Not to mention wordy (I realize I'm being hypocritical here, considering the phrase I just wrote). <br /> <br /> This show goes on forever. I do not know if there is any plot, and the static monsters do not have any Pok characters Even when it's not compared to my cartoon as a kid, this show sucks. It's unintentionally funny, but it's not funny enough to be worth seeing. Bye, bye, sleep well, dream of wet dreams.
