- A newly married couple moves to the house of their husband's ex-wife. It's not long before the new wife starts to get the feeling that someone does not want her at home. She sees skulls all over the house. But when her husband investigates, he can not find anything. Is anyone trying to get you back to the asylum she was recently dismissed from? Or is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house? <br /> <br /> - This is the first time I watch The Screaming Skull without the help of the MST3K team. And, in all probability, it will be the last time I watch it that way. Can you say boring? I'm not talking common nonsense - I'm talking watching grass grow bland. There are large extensions of the movie where nothing happens. The screen could have gone blank and I would have gotten as much entertainment as that. The characters continued with the most monotonous conversations imaginable. Screaming Skull could probably be marketed as a sleep helper. <br /> <br /> - The actors do not help much. Most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a part of elementary school. I did not look up, but I would be shocked to discover that someone associated with this movie has already appeared in anything of cinematographic value. I will not even get into the script that the actors receive to work. Let's just say the characters get some of the dumbest phrases ever uttered in the movie. <br /> <br /> - You've been warned! Avoid this at all costs or at least look for the MST3K version.
