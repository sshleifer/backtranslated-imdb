The main reasons to see "Red Eye" are Rachel McAdams, who features a stellar performance, and Jayma Mays, who is wonderful as an assistant hotel manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy surpasses so much that he becomes caricatured. The rest of the movie is filled with holes, about which I will elaborate. <br /> <br /> Please do not read over if you do not want to know what happens! <br /> <br /> Here is a plot synopsis. The character of Rachel McAdams (Lisa) runs a hotel where the inflexible new Director of Homeland Security plans to stay that night. Rachel is returning to Miami from a funeral, but taking calls from her assistant until the plane leaves. Meanwhile, someone is parked outside his father's house, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa needs to do is call the hotel and take the director's suite to one where Jackson's teammates plan to fire a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> So, here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences: 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call, and in the middle, the phones on the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to pretend she's making the call, but coincidentally, a guy on the other side of Jackson's aisle is also making a call and starts hitting the phone to indicate he's dead. Jackson picks up and picks up Lisa's phone. <br /> <br /> 2. At one point, Jackson fits in the head and Lisa, of course, is knocked out ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson catches Lisa by writing a note in the bathroom mirror (extraordinarily large), and he knocks a little on her. Miraculously, the only person who hears anything is an 11-year-old girl, whose word, of course, is inconsiderate. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa stabs Jackson with a pen in the throat as the plane lands, steals her cell phone and makes a mad run for the exit, fitting into the aisle between the seats and 18 standing rows of passengers . Despite knowing there is a passenger with a pen stuck in the throat, flight attendants force Lisa to open the jet-port. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, all of these are reasonable (if not highly unlikely). But here's where it gets really stupid. Lisa enters the terminal at Miami Airport, and there is no cell phone signal (all major airports in America have good cell phone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. She runs through the airport with Jackson in pursuit, and no security officer ever delays them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport as the gates train pulled away to the terminal, lost some of his voice from the pen in his throat, but he can still be understood. However, he does not bother to call his man out of Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at Miami Airport, but what they showed was very similar to Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and leaves. Of course this time, when she is going to make a call, the cell phone says "low battery" and soon turns off (when will they stop using this device futile plot?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone still said "low battery", Lisa arrived at her assistant just in time to save the director and her family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the room window in the 40th where the director had been. moved. Of course, they hope we do not realize that the hotel is surrounded on three sides by the ocean, so the missile probably could have been thrown in the first suite, thus negating the need for all of Lisa-Jackson's conspiracy. What's the story here? Was the director's original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a bad view? However, everyone leaves just before the missile hits. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa drives to Joe's house to save his dad just to see the killer outside. Although she stumbles (while he's shooting at her) by putting her jeep into the house, no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe's house and drives him out (we do not see how ... maybe another butt). He then explains to Lisa that he did not kill his father yet because he wanted Dad to see Lisa die first. (Give me some time.) What is this? Saturday morning drawings? <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the film (about 20 minutes), Jackson chases Lisa around the house, and she fights with him. Of course, a real killer (for example, one perhaps played by Jason Statham) would have eliminated Lisa (or someone who is not a trained killer) in the first 30 seconds. During the course of this chase, Jackson steps on Joe at least once without bothering to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson prevails, and he's about to kill Lisa when (you guessed it) he's shot by Joe. <br /> <br /> So here's my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven to stick to terror. Or maybe he should meet Michael Bay (who directed the equally stupid "The Island") and make "Red Island".
