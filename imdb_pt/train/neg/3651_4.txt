I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I have a movie with a few funny jokes and many that just do not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was confusing. It would have been funnier if they'd had someone new, rather than Moriarty resurrected. Some of the things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. The McGarrett of Hawaii 5-0 was not at all like McGarrett. Connie Booth is obviously very good with accents. She's from Indiana, but she played very well English and a New Yorker. Unfortunately, it was not presented much in the script. I was expecting a funniest movie. Instead, I got a pretty confusing movie with a bad script. Quite ironic, since both Booth and Cleese were in it together. Maybe they were about to end on 77.
