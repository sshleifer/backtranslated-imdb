This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming feature of this film is that the next time people ask me which is the worst vampire movie I've ever watched, I'd have an adequate response. <br /> <br /> I think it's filmed in 35mm, so it's already tacky as hell. I would not have bothered to comment, but I noticed that some fanboys (probably connected to the movie) claimed that this was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me unmask the myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good about the movie. Everything screams cheesy. The actress is ugly. The fight's choreography is the worst I've ever seen. The fight scenes are incredibly amateur. Imagine a girl waving her arms in a circle, impotent and giving weak kicks that would not hurt a kitten. Obviously, the director simply took people off the street to give them roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I know the director does not have a lot of budget for the film, but better films have still been made on a smaller budget before. Unforgiven.
