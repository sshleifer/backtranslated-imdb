I bought the DVD version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife, who loved the version she aired on television. But the version put on DVD was a disaster. The lighting was poor to nonexistent and whole scenes were simply excised. In one example, Adele is being taken to bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - arriving in the middle of the sentence - where is the next night. Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never introduced, which leads us to wonder if they dozed for a few minutes during the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $ 6.32 it was a gyp. <br /> <br /> Be careful what version of this movie you buy! We're sending this back.
