I've seen other guinea pig films like Mermaid in Manhole and he never dies, and while they're very sick, they at least have a little sense of humor to them (however dark). The Devil's Experiment, however, is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks by subjecting a young woman to many methods of torture and violence and there is no plot or redeeming values ​​for it. It's not remotely scary except for maybe the mentality, but it's definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment. Now, I'm not the paradigm of good taste in movies and I like my trash and junk, but that was too much for me, actually. I'm all disturbing, in fact, I look for things that are upsetting whenever possible, but that was a bit much. The young woman is kicked, beaten, subjected to continuous noises through headphones until she drooling, and then tossed with raw meat and viscera and left hanging in a hammock in the forest somewhere. If you think this sounds great, go ahead, but this certainly prevented me from seeing more things about the guinea pig. 1 out of 10, absolutely nauseating.
