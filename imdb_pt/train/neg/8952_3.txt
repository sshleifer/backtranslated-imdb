After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece all my life, I am now 37 years old, but never having read the book, I am totally confused by what I have just seen. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as I am sure most are, but only through rumors and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, this movie would have been a complete mystery, and even with that I am not yet more educated about the history of 1984 than before watching. <br /> <br /> On the positive side. .. The cinematography is incredible, Hurt & Burton offers perfect performances and the overall feel of the film is wonderfully dark and bleak. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark film. <br /> <br /> Now to the lower sides, and there are many ... <br /> <br /> There's a war going on, less about propaganda), but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of used names (Eurasia etc), but they do not mean anything without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what he does? where does he come from? where does he work? Why is he changing the news? Why is not he on the front line? Why does not he eat the food in the canteen? What is the drink he drinks throughout the movie? Why is he so weak and sick? Why does not he brainwash like the rest of them? What is the matter with your mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little background story would have been cool, without rubbing it, essential for people like me who did not read the book. Without it, it's just a confusing and hard-to-follow art movie that constantly makes you guess what's really going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack has been disjointed and poorly edited and the constant chatter on Big Brother screens floods the dialogue in places, making it even harder to figure out what's going on. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice, but it's very annoying anyway. <br /> <br /> Besides, I know this has already been mentioned before, but why all nudity? It seemed totally free and looked like it had been played there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage. <br /> <br /> I personally can not bear the way that Hollywood feels it has to explain the story of the lines to the word these days. We're not all brainwashing simpletons, but that's a few steps too far to the other side. I can only imagine that this totally depends on the fact that you read the book because if this movie really is the 'literal translation' that I've seen many people say, I would find it very difficult to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic is. <br /> <br /> There is no denying that it was light years ahead of its time and practically predicted all the changes in our society to this day, (perhaps this was some kind of bible for the Powers that they are?) , but many science fiction novelists did the same without leaving gaps in the plot. <br /> <br /> I think I have to do what I should have done right from the start and buy a copy of the book if I want to make any sense out of it. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed with something that I've waited for years to watch.
