I've tried watching this comedy, but it's very hard to bear. This is a bad movie, narrow and full of clich√©s. It's definitely not funny, but really annoying and boring, in fact. Bad script, bad acting. It's a complete waste of time - and there's nothing left to say, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 points.
