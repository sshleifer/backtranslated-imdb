This film is a vehicle for the Schwarzenegger clone, Alexander Nevsky. His charisma, however, is insufficient to elevate this film above the level of his unsatisfactory script. He has little to add to his act of Arnie. <br /> <br /> Michael York is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat. Watching him revisit his D'Artagnan act since he was a better actor made me uncomfortable. Come on, you can do better than that! <br /> <br /> History is full of holes and inexplicable relationships; The top of this account is Vlad's informant, who sounds like an American woman, but from the context seems to be working for a Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story takes place well after the end of the communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contradiction to this, Vlad can drive a utility vehicle as a police car. The action scenes are poorly filmed and, therefore, lack of momentum. <br /> <br /> No need to watch film ...
