Guys who - even THINK of watching this movie already have some disturbance going through their heads .. This movie has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper (if he thinks it is) is another B, I mean E-Grid compound film of a bunch of teenagers excited at certain sex scenes being watched shortly before leaving their speckled spleens in a nearby tree. It's not scary, funny or funny. If you really feel like bloody things without plot, then watch Cabin Fever, at least the director did not fall asleep in the middle of driving this crap. Just watch this if you absolutely have nothing to do in life and the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey crying on the TV set.
