This movie was so relentlessly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching. Direction, editing, production and screenplay seemed to have been made by high school students who did not know much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any kind of sense. Great emotional moments and climaxes (such as one at the beginning between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (as one suggested at first) go completely out of nowhere and are not set up as if they were in a more elegant setting. and effectively made movie. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any kind of connection with them. The performance, surprisingly, is not totally bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays as a particularly bad / epic western / epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story he tries to tell. I have read many reviews that advocate the film as being important to Australians because of the subject. All of this is fine, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOES NOT DO THE GOOD MOVIE. No one is saying that the subject is not good, just the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event for Americans, but that does not mean that I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good because it was still bad. A failure everywhere, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.
