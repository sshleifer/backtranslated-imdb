Always enjoy great movies that deal with the supernatural and deep thoughts of the spirit world. However, this movie just turned me off as much as its production and direction. There is nothing to enter into deep discussion about what this story has to tell; All I can say is that it was a great waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, did an excellent performance in their homeland, England, and we saw him on "Still Standing," a TV series. Heath Ledger, played the real evil face and we recently saw him in "Brokeback Mountain", 05, gave a great supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair) did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith. Do not waste your time, you will be sorry!
