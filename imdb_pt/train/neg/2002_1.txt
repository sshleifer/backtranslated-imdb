A shaky handheld camera was used, supposedly to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I started getting seasick just by watching it. It looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera (no offense to CP sufferers, but I do not think you'd expect to get much work as a cinematographer!) The camera work was so nauseating, and so distracting, that my wife and I consider this unacceptable and we give up after 10 minutes of torture. I checked back some time later (it was appearing on TV), and it had not improved. I suggest giving this a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten!
