I'm a big fan of old horror movies, and since I'm middle-aged, the old for me is a movie made before 1970, the majority being made in the 1920s to the 1960s. I'm not a big fan of movies of modern horror, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could reminisce about the stories there, but I really really liked the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. All the stories were great though. So why did I like them so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was bad, the pieces of horror were augmented with a close-up of a horrified face with fear, and the funny pieces were really funny! This sequel is either very lacking in these elements or they are totally missing! I'm writing this just by partially watching because the movie was a complete waste of time and I hung it up to do other things like write movie reviews on the movie, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get a higher billing, this is telling you something ... 4 out of 10. In addition, Romero's expertise is hard to find here, they must have told him to tone down a PG standard I do not know what this was rated on but seems PG to me), and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on. He is shown on the Encore cable channel if your die (yuck yuck) to see it.
