I gave this movie 2 stars just because Dominic Monaghan really put effort into his acting. Everything else in this movie is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only does the director need to rethink what she's doing for a life career, but maybe she should watch some movies. As Dominic Monaghan is a very dependable actor, putting him in a movie of this caliber makes him look horrible. Whoever the "actor" was Jack's best friend, he should never have stepped in front of the camera. I did not expect much from such a small movie, but maybe a little more time and effort should be put on the characters and the surroundings. Do not waste your time or money on this movie (as I did) you will be very disappointed.
