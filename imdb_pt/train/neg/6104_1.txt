"Fungicide" is possibly the most incompetent, embarrassing and deplorable "movie" I have ever seen. The acting is criminal, the direction virtually nonexistent and the special effects presumably brought together releasing a monkey with learning difficulties on a helpless laptop. <br /> <br /> Far from me stifling creativity, but I truly believe that things like this should not be done. I'm sure the "filmmakers" will say that, yes, the "movie" was hampered by a low budget (as in anything) - but in that case, they simply should not have bothered. So they offered the world something so terrible, so execrable, that only the fools could get the slightest tinge of pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> Starting the "movie" was not like I was expecting "Citizen Kane" or anything. I was expecting a bit of low budget with maybe a little creativity, a hint of fun and even a little energy. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, our leering anti-hero scientist, who works in the basement of his parents, is seen mantically stirring a little in a cup. Apparently, this high-level science is the end result of years of research. His parents then send him to a strange hotel in the country to relax. There are other people there who are simply too horrible to write. Anyway, the scientist puts his test tube in some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people. (Wow, I'm getting suicidal just by writing the plot summary). Our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar (attaching a "fuse" - really a piece of string - to it). The barrel explodes inexplicably with the power of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all mushrooms. The end. (Thank God). <br /> <br /> This summary is as good as the "movie" (and it really makes it look a lot more interesting than it really is). I really should never have passed this stage of development (by which I mean a sketch of plot scrawled on the back of an envelope with wax chalk). Someone should have really taken a step and given someone a vigorous shake and said "NO". <br /> <br /> And these "special" effects. Well, they are "special." This is crazed CGI. And made by a person I can only assume believes that the bicycle pump is the pinnacle of modern technology. And when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home-computing bundle, they are represented by actors mixed in a sheet (I'm not joking). <br /> <br /> One of the most inexcusable things. about the film is its laziness. This can be summed up by the scene in which the hero turns his weapons (to Clint Eastwood) and then fails miserably to put them in his pockets. I mean, let's go ahead, some retakes and he could have gotten it, but just to leave it as it is - really weak. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that money was spent on this camcorder junk. Producers of "movies" should be ashamed and forbidden to go within fifty yards of any filmmaking equipment. <br /> <br /> I also think it wrong that friends and relatives come to the IMDb. and post lying evaluations and giving stupidly high ratings that give a totally inaccurate "movie" picture. "Fungicide" is an absolute farce of cinema. Mr. Wascavage is very, very stupid or very, very cynical.
