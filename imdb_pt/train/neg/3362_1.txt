The Haunting is another bad horror remake with exaggerated special effects and a large cast of on-screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities except perhaps for cinematography. Sims remakes are not bad, but the remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are. I suppose the A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract us from the boring plot, ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts to scare your audience, however this is a movie not a magazine tabloid we no matter who we care about the characters and the story two things this movie missed. The plot is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and ripping off four chapters and then using what's left for the movie is so boring and a lot of it is inexplicable. The characters are very fine and although the interpretation is good, you do not care about any of the characters. Lily Taylor makes a horrendous performance and it looks like she's 8 years old. She is old when delivering her lines not to mention what she is horribly glaring at. Lily Taylor is not made for the horror genre. Ghosts are stupid and extravagant, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper to Halloween with a smoke machine. There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and is not even funny without wanting simply sad. The house is beautiful and well designed which is probably the only positive thing about this movie looks good but that does not save it from all that is brutal. I can honestly say that I felt like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting in TV at no price so I would have stayed even more pi $$ if I had paid to see, but fortunately I was on the Scream Channel. The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to dominate you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.
