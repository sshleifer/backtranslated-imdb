In my humble opinion, this version of the great musical BDWY has only two things - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch.) But to me that's all there is. Most of the cast seems to be walking the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and no wonder people get over Harry McAfee when he's played by George Wendt, who seems to prefer being back on a stool hotel in Boston. . Jason Alexander is passable, but this wig has to go and I've seen better dancing in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good to have a version of the stage script now, but I hope the young people who have never seen a musical, DO NOT judge everyone for it.
