Who ever wrote the two or three complimentary reviews or were involved in the production of that movie, freely used term, or bank rolling, and if this was the case, I would want my seven dollars back! The actors, once again used weakly, are terrible, in fact almost none of them did anything again, which is a relief. The scenery and all that screams, we had 7 dollars to work and a day to do it in. Was this filmed in someone's yard? Everything about this project says low budget. The actors, at best, were on the D list. Do not waste time, unless, of course, you want to get it back and try to recoup the rent. The main evil guy looks like that 70's punk who ended up marrying his grandmother, the daughter of moore. My local blockbuster video store list this as the most returned movie with sad comments attached. Even as a rental of 99 cents, this movie collects dust. Someone really should have some favors. This is a super stinky one and I give 10 mouths.
