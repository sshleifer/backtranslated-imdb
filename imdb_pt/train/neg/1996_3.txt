This little sad movie bears little resemblance to the Broadway revival of 1971, which was a "nostalgic" success. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed this revival, he rewrote the book extensively. I have the feeling that this screenwriter did as much as a change from the original 1925 version as well. I played the innocent "womanizer" Jimmy Smith onstage in 1974, and I thought this $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the anticipated pleasure of seeing "Topper" Roland Young playing "my" part was a big disappointment. Three songs from the play remain and are done very poorly. Even the classic duet, "Tea For Two," is made as a virtual solo. The many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco are not proud at all, and the star, Anna Neagle, is embarrassed. When I feel cheated of spending a dollar, I know the movie must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the version of Doris Day, which is actually called "Tea For Two" and is about doing the play (the original, of course), so those who are looking for the real "No No Nanette" can find a more recognizable version. over there.
