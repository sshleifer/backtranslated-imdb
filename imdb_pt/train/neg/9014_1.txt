there are those movies that are bad, they are funny, so there are those where you scream "I want that one and a half hours of my life back" ... that's basically what this is. <br /> <br /> Dean Caim tries to be an actor, but fails. the sfx is very bad (repeated scenes and stones that look like falling paper) and the fake plastic guns that have torches etched in them ... the split screen effect used to show several things going on at the same time is just terrible. <br /> <br /> This movie can not be used as one of those simple night entertainers, it's so bad <br /> <br /> If I could have negative ratings,
