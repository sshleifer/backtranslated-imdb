This story about three women is a very sensitive study on: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), who is about 37 years old, and Martha (Frieda Pittors), the oldest being the mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from a village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha dreams of her youth when she was young. In fact, nothing happens in this movie, so you wait for something - for example, an accident - that can dramatize this story. As time goes on, you discover that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. This movie is disappointing because you expect women to learn from your experiences, which is not the case, so the person gets a feeling of emptiness.
