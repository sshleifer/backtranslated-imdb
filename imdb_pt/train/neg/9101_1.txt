This movie was like "The Disney Channel after Dark". Take the language and themes "we are not disobedient" and you will have the devices of dialogue and plot that insult the intelligence of those who do not describe "Saved by the Bell" as quality television. The dialogue so ridiculously clich√© and consciously dirty, one might think that the script was the product of locking Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of each bad script that each one has already had a part in creating. If that was the intention of Roger Kumble, mission accomplished.
