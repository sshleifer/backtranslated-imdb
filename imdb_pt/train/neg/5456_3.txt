This is just one more of those heinous movies you find on Lifetime TV, which depict the disgusting behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathic way. Along with other nasty movies like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster", this movie takes a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why she is not such a bad person. Give us some time! Here's my question for the filmmakers: If LeTourneau was a man, and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, would you have taken a photo sympathetic and empathizing with that person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> <br /> Imagine changing the genres in this movie, and then you'll see why me and others here consider it a useless piece of junk. If the genders changed, there would be no attempt at empathy with the criminal. Instead, we would probably be treated to a picture of a monstrous and ghastly man attacking a young girl, with her lascivious behavior to arrest him in prison, and his victim suffering from brainwashing suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason why LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is because of his sex. <br /> <br /> Let's call it a sword spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Clear and simple. I do not want any excuses. She is a criminal who belongs to the prison and deserves our scorn and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.
