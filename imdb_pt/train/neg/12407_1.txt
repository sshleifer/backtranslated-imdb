Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a nanny for young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie really misses her mother and continually visits her grave (conveniently located in a graveyard just behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> begins well with a truly strange sequence in the graveyard ... then collapses. The story is thin and there are tons of padding to make the movie 85 minutes long. The acting is terrible in every way (with Cole being easily the worst). Misdirected with some of the WORST issues I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes (and sound) are cut without rhyme or reason. Also the film has a terrible (and obvious) post-production sound. <br /> <br /> As for blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and the one there seems incredibly bogus. I've never seen this fake-looking blood - it looks like ketchup! Boring, senseless - a drive-in movie legitimately overlooked. You can skip this one.
