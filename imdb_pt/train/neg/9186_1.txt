Do you know that feeling of joy when you watch a movie that is trying so hard to be a serious and thought-provoking piece of film and fails miserably? When can you not but laugh at the terrible nature of the garbage that covers your screen? "House of the Dead" struggles to achieve even this low level of cinema. From beginning to end "House of the Dead" can recreate the feeling that you've just woken up to discover that the cat put your business curled up on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the outset that female actors have been escalated to their cleavage size (which they exploit blatantly) while males for their hardcore "kick-ass" attitude. I honestly did not care about any of the characters at any point in the movie and actually found myself wishing for their death to spare me a good time of that torture. Uwe Boll should have considered viewing two hours of footage of the game itself as a movie. At least then, let's improve acting? However, not all the blame can be attributed to the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a compelling film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst part of the film and actually contains lines like "These are zombies, pure and simple" and "In cap'n, we should not go there! It's bad!". <br /> <br /> We all know that zombie movies will never be particularly provocative or full of meaning; at best, are two harmless hours of action, blood and terror. Rubbish, yes, but fun junk. It's not the kind of trash that comes out of your bag as you drag it around the room and suffocate your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana peels. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" has received such negative reviews that no Danish filmmakers bought the film. If only we could have the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final score: 1/10.
