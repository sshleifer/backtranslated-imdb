Comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable, so save time and money by renting this timeless classic. Speaking of punctuality, there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed in who could find the most anachronism in a movie. They would have loved this movie of all the songs and some of the clothes were wrong. There were astute references like "they paved paradise to build a parking lot". The filmmakers hoped to draw a few smiles from us, but basically made me moan. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are incredibly political and socially intelligent for teenagers. Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties when they wrote the movie. Very little of what the characters said was believable. Combine the poor writing and misinterpretation of this film. Although, there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams cheered things up as the future child of flowers and, despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was very good. Showing that feature that would boil in his eventual appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
