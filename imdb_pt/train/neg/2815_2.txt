Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who normally makes very good horror movies, but he could not do very well. Englund plays the well-known Marque De Sade, who in the 17th century was imprisoned for his obsession with pain and the pleasure of causing himself pain, as well as watching others feel pain. The story is so confusing with the flip-flop from one century to the next and I was confused about what was going on and what the purpose of this movie was. All I saw was a young woman who was trapped by a strange lesbian who wants to keep it to herself and the young lady was fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and discovers that he is out to kill her and then Englund enters. One century after another, claiming to be a descendant of De Sade and trying to kill her, because she reminded him of Madame Momoselle (wrong writing) or whoever was in the photo above the wall De Sades. The film was terrible, I'm surprised Hooper for hiring Englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable, especially the part about the eyes. Englund tries to make a return of his movement once hit "Nightmare on Elm St." using these needles to pull and remove people's eyes. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
