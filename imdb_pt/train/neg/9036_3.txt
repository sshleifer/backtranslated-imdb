I can not believe I wasted my time watching this crap! I did because Leonard Maltin gave it an "AA" rating, and for TV movies this is generally a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The acting was OK, but who wrote should be denied access forever to any medium of communication. The plot is ridiculous, the motives of the bandits totally absent and the various silly and superficial family interactions. For example, Daddy preaches that violent reaction to aggression is EVIL, but he reveals himself an "admirable" person NOT because of his "ignoring the idiots" philosophy, but because he is very good with fists ... < > <br /> The ONLY message I could gather from this pap is that the nuclear family is good and alternative arrangements are bad. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
