Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> Unusual setting for an American war movie, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> Unusual subject, four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers, from one who takes the illegitimate child of the dead son of one senator, to another living with seven Marines (one at a time) before being murdered by her husband returning POW New Zealand. <br /> <br /> Unusual to see Paul Newman deliver such a poor performance as soon after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody Up There Loves Me". <br /> <br /> Unusual for two well "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, to leave so little of themselves in a movie. <br /> <br /> Unusual that I could be bothered to write a review of such a poor movie, give it a miss!
