All other comments have already said what I was going to say, here it goes anyway. I thought this was Italian in the beginning, sorry for that in Italy. I was not bored because I kept waiting for something to happen. Who did this song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather when? Was it Alan Parsons? I saw this in a package of 10 Brentwood and the quality was as expected, terrible. Full of stripes and stuff. The movie was an incoherent mess. Goofy music and characters with no concept. The main guy should know in the first minute that the doctor was crazier than the patients. I thought the "doctor" directing the "battle" scene would never end. Had some beautiful babies though. It seems like these dumb movies always play a naked girl or two and that leaves you hooked. I gave a 2 for nekkid women. That bird that people dance made me want to take my own eyes. Poe probably made about 3,000 rpms in his grave when this thing left because it was loosely based on a story from him.
