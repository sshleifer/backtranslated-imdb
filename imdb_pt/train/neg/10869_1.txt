A friend of mine loaned this video to me and I was quite excited to watch it, but after ten minutes of James Hetfield and Lars 'slow vocals pounding on what appeared to be slow-motion, I began to think,' Why am I watching that? This question will be going through their minds at 5 ?? 10 minutes after you click Play. I returned the tape the same day, as you would suspect, not worth buying or watching! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
