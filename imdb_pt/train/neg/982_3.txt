The real star of this ridiculous story is the glorious technicolor. A visual delight to the eye, the film can not stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued, at first, with the idea of ​​Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion to "find" their capacity to love. What follows is a big disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in the production and feels his torment. Dietrich's incredible wardrobe overcomes his performance - sometimes his face is scary to look at - an insensitive mask. As a monk, Boyer supported the monastery liquor formula (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when he leaves his "marriage to God", the reaction of his fellow monks holds the shock and fear perpetuating organized religion. The viewer feels that Boyer was quite free of his past. However, the journey that follows is very predictable.
