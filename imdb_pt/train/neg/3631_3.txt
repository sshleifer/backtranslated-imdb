Of course, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is one of my favorites, Knappertsbusch, 1951 in particular. The whole Syberberg approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly starts to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace. The achievements of Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. What happened to movie editing? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The spectator is never transported spiritually. His impulse is to run home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner was right, that Syberberg missed. And that setting with those "clever" reminders of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will there ever be a viewer of that film without any prior knowledge of Wagner?
