Disappointing and predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can not maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre "Anywhere But Here," starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, gave a much better view of a mother / daughter relationship. With better acting too.
