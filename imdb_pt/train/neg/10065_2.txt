Much worse than the original. It was really * painful * to sit down, and barely held my six-year-old interest. <br /> <br /> Introduction of some new Pok√©mon is marginally interesting, but the plot is extra-fine, the dialogue is still poor, and the music is mediocre. Watch the TV show instead - it's much better.
