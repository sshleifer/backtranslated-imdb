Despite much style, flash and glitter, this French musical can not speak. The songs are repetitive, predictable and tedious. The story is uninteresting, as are the many characters. <br /> <br /> People go into music and dance without motivation or reason. Most of the cast wears wigs and fake hair, and the sets seem hopelessly tied to the studios. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, a negative effect on the video. me. Certainly a shame, to have such a talented cast in such a weak final effort. <br /> <br /> It goes to show, I think, where followups (in this case, for the great classic, "Umbrellas") often go wrong. You can not recapture, just recreate.
