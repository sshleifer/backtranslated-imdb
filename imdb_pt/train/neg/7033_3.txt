Black Candles is a confusing mess of the same director who brought us "Vampires" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others ... I'm just watching the ones I saw. Anyway, we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by, a pin is positioned on a voodoo doll and then pierces it, and the man walks away. I'm not sure if it was good for any of them, at that moment. Fast forward to where the man's sister came to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everyone except her is involved in something, what happens to be worship of the devil . It's really hard to tell who's who at moments during the movie and gets a bit confused at times. To spice things up though, there is a scene of simulated bestiality (I hope it is simulated) with a black goat, sure to please everyone. Ugh Sometimes this echoes "Rosemary's Baby" minus the baby because the hostess is always giving a woman herbal tea and the place smells like any unpleasant satanic herbs that they are too, because this is still being observed. However, herbs are not the only thing that smells like this movie. The end seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers may wonder where they were during the middle part. It's not incontestable, it's not very good, and I think it all depends on what you like to see in the movies, and there was not much here that would do a lot for me. 3 out of 10.
