This film (along with Rinne) are small pearls among the rehearsal tribute photos that have gone to horror movies so far in the 8FTDF "HorrorFest". And, yes, it's a weak compliment, in fact. Because there is not much worse in the cinema than candidates for authors who think that the atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with the Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely on the chief of directors. Of course, it would have been nice if he had transferred to film, but this happened instead. It's a very beautiful film, with some genuine scares, but the last roll is strictly for the audience of latter sleasting cineaste.
