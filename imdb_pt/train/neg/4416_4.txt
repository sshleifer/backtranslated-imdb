A less than subtle nudging in the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker tone of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humor plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetorical questions are asked, especially "If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?" <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton excels in her role as an exaggerated version (although some might disagree) of the stereotypical religious teacher who launches the "line of business" and condemns half the world to burn in Hell. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of her school, she invites her first students to return and hold their Christmas contest. <br /> <br /> However, when the quartet "updates" her play to parody Sister Mary's "fallacious" teachings, the nun is pushed to the edge, sending the spiral story into a chain of unhappy events. The ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Go watch the play instead.
