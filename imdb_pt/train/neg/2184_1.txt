This film is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill-conceived plot devices. <br /> <br /> Movie Story: The director of this movie was a pervert who drove around town filming random women. When his wife discovered the rolls of film, he was forced to create a story quickly. He claimed he was making a movie called "The Brain That Would not Die". Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her her "called movie". That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and "The brain that would not die" was born. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Plot summary: The groom's main character is killed in a horrible car crash (which he caused by ignoring the clearly placed traffic signs). He grabs her head from the debris and revives her. After resuscitating his head, he goes and picks up a lot of prostitutes. That's pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie. In the end, he fights and is killed by a monster who lives in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monster saves a prostitute and I suppose they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Side Notes: The final credit screen states that the movie is called "The Head That Would not Die". /> <br /> I hate this movie!
