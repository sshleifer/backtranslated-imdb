Columbo's films have been in decline for years, this year may have come to an end. Peter Falk gives the same uninspiring performance and comes so scary in this movie. As usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unprecedented, so lack of plausibility is always missing. Brenda Vaccaro chews the landscape and pulls faces of pantomime, and Andrew Stephens is a very unconvincing lady man. (Its weak, though, was a joke!) The script was about the numbers and their condescending delivery. They should never have brought Columbus to the nineties, they just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots, better scripts, and sharp characterizations.
