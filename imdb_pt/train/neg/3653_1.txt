I can not help but I look like movies that are made to be scary and are just plain bad. I personally listed it in my top 10 worst films right under the creatures of the abyss! Watch this movie and have a laugh just do not expect to see any Academy awards for acting. More chance to understand the movie. In all honesty I've seen much worse than that. Also, some maniacs roaming the desert cleaning up the same people who have just died is unbelievable that this was original. I think it's one of those love or hate movies. you can make up your own mind, yeah, it's horrible, but pull it somehow that's why I love it
