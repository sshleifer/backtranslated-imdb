This show comes with interesting places as fast as the travel channel. It is heralded as reality, but in fact it is pure soap opera in prime time. He tries to use exotic locales as a front to get people to a fake contest and then attract viewers in the novel style of competitors. <br /> <br /> He also borrows from one of the first CBS pioneers - Beat The Clock - inventing situations for his competitors to try and outdo. Then reward the winner's money. If they can match it with a bit of interaction between the characters, even better. While the format of the game is in slow motion against Beat The Clock, the true achievement of this series is to escape reality. <br /> <br /> This program has elements of various types of previous successful programs. Reality of television, hardly, but if you are addicted to competitors, venue or contest, this is your cup of tea. If its not, this whole series is as I say, drivel dripping with gravy. It's another show hidden behind the reality label, which is the trend that started in 2000. <br /> <br /> It's smooth and well-made so it can last a while yet. After all, the same goes for the reruns of Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Brady Bunch. This simply does not employ professional actors. The level of intelligence is the same.
