"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many films of the 1950s about teenagers who come across the supernatural. In this case, the adolescents can not pay the rent of the place and are evicted. With nowhere else to go, they decide on a seemingly haunted house. As you may have guessed, when they arrive, some strange things begin to happen. And there's a twist in the end. <br /> <br /> There's nothing in this movie that you have not seen in other movies, but it's good entertainment, though. My favorite character was the dirty-mouth parrot. Well, let me rephrase this: he did not speak as a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things we do not expect from a bird. The pure movie hokum, but harmless.
