There were a lot of really great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this movie is certainly not one of them! It's a shame The Child is no better, for it works from a decent idea that includes some sometimes successful terror themes. We have the idea of ​​a vengeful child, who worked so well in classic films like The Bad Seed and then we have the central theme of the zombies, which of course has been the backbone of many successful horror films. The plot is basically this: the young woman blames a load of people for her mother's death, so she goes to the graveyard and resuscitates the dead to take revenge (as you do). This is all good, except it's boring! Nothing happens during most of the film, and despite picking up at the end with something good; is not enough of an end to justify the rest. The film was obviously run on a budget, since the locations seem cheap and all the actors are silly. There is not much I can say about the film as a whole, as there is not much to do. The Child is a dark horror film from the seventies and I certainly do not recommend it.
