Somehow, a woman working with a scientist puts metal balls in the mouths of people who are supposed to change her personality, but in reality turns them into crazed murderers who look like zombies. The "guinea pigs" for the experiment are young women, half naked and naked, in desperate need of interpretation classes. This movie is horrible, atrocious and incredibly bad. It has little or no logic in the script. You will really have trouble following what is happening. It has no special effects. The computer screen that supposedly represents a huge scientific breakthrough looks like nothing more than an old Atari screen. What's even worse is that there is also a felt-haired marionette (looks like a lonely child in summer camp) called George, who is like a personal maid / confidant of Jessica (the "leading actress"). Throughout the film, you will be subjected to the idiot and sophisticated statements of this doll. But wait ... you'll also get a lot of softcore, unerotic, almost nude scenes with the girls with some guys from the bar. All along, a very annoying soundtrack plays in the background, as if some sort of spiritual discovery had occurred. None of the actors are good. There are only several degrees of bad. The bloody and "horror" aspects are filmed in a particularly inept way. The movie really looks like a teenager. No coincidence Henry Sala, the director by name, but not by trade, did not make another film. I was bored almost in a coma watching this silly asshole! What about the end? What happened? If you know, let me get into the secret, because for my life I can not figure it out. All I know is that I wasted my time looking at this crap that made the start of my weekend a nightmare!
