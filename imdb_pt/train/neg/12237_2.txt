Original Claymation Rudolph: Very good. Original Frosty cartoon: It needs a bit of work, but it can be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on the Fourth of July? Come on! Give me some time!!! This was a movie that should not have been made. It was bad. It really was not for any particular holiday, except July 4. This made it especially bad since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And any movie can be ruined by singing too much. Frequent songs made this movie seem much longer than it actually was. The film tried to mix two familiar characters from the Christmas season with a traditional American holiday (which almost seems to "limit" America), many nonsense songs and a bad storyline. The result? A bad movie that can not be watched at any time of the year. I suggest you give up this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
