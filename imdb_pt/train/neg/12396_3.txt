There is not much good to say about Underneath, Soderbergh's fake effort for neo-noir. Soderbergh remakes Criss-Cross's noir decent Robert Siodmak faithfully, not much altering the plot at all, however the adaptation drains him of every ounce of his state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere, giving him the same story set not much places, lifestyles, and less attractive anachronisms. Soderbergh, who would later make wonderful out-of-the-way movies like Out of Sight and the Ocean series with great style and atmosphere, remains dangerously obvious for modernization, renewing the story with the ugliest, dullest, and smoothest clothes of the early 1990s. nightclubs have terribly revolted garage gangs, Peter Gallagher's uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster's anti-hero is left by his fateful girlfriend for compulsively buying lifeless modern gadgets like stereos, TVs and other modern equipment that suck up the reaction. It could have been more fun and less boring if it had some saving graces as a good trail, more meat for its characters, more than just William Fichtner giving performances that are not t wood, a clearer rhythm. Unfortunately, Underneath does not have any of those things. Soderbergh, a good director, does not use his dry detachment for the benefit of his film this time around. This arrangement works wonderfully when he is directing a crime film with more tongue in his cheek, like the photos of George Clooney previously mentioned, or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex, lies and videotape. With a film like Underneath, it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer.
