What a lost cast. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert usually does not disappoint me, but I feel cheated after seeing this. movie. <br /> <br /> The only thrill is to see Elizabeth benches in her bra. This is a sad phrase about this movie. It was very promising, but it was like having sex with a transvestite. <br /> <br /> This is a self-absorbed gut. <br /> <br /> I can not express my bitterness enough to have watched this movie. and I hope I can warn you of the same disappointment.
