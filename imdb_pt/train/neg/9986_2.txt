The next time you are at a party and someone asks, "The other day I heard the expression 'The author's will.' Does anyone know what that means?" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could have survived this movie was through this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some comic strips and you will have a few laughs. However, the movie does not support the slightest logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why then can she make the chainsaw gag, of course. For me, the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four dollars at the video store.
