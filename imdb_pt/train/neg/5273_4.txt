*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview of this movie, I thought it would be at least a slightly admirable plot. But like most of the original superstation movies I was disappointed. This na√Øve family ends up driving through this "deserted" city to get a brake and find this camcorder showing these people doing everything they want and finds that they all disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or exhibits what the hell is chasing them. They are more gaps than I can tell and do not explain anything that happens like or what. It ends where the family goes into a car accident and gets posest, brainwashed or something (which is never explained). The next thing you know is that they hope to somehow figure out how it all happened, but it ends up leaving you completely confused.
