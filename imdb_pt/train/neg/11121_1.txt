I really can not understand how anyone could give this disgusting movie more than one star ... How can you like such a slow movie where all the scenes of animal abuse are real? I do not even want to imagine the excruciating pain that innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would torture them like that for no reason, or just for money? I tell you, that director is mentally retarded, or he's just a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. He really deserves to have his hands cut and burn alive. <br /> <br /> It contains several horribly barbarous scenes that can cause shock, especially for sensitive people and children: a real frog is skinned live, fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, birds are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than horrible; has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made, along with another, called '' Cannibal Holocaust '' or something like that. I will never watch or buy any movie directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste their time watching, especially when there are many really good movies out there in which all animal abuse scenes are staged. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, few people liked that - which is natural, since it is the worst movie ever - then it was unsuccessful. I hope this causes the retarded director to realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to REAL animals will NEVER be commended, and that he will stage all animal abuse scenes in his subsequent films. I truly believe that everyone gets, but what they give! There will be a day when all the retarded and cruel "humans" will feel the same pain they once inflicted on others. <br /> <br /> However, this is probably my only negative review. I usually do not comment on a movie if I do not like it, but this time I just could not shut up. I had to tell you the truth, because animal abuse must stop!
