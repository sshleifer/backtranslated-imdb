This movie is deeply disappointing. Not only does Wenders exhibit only a very limited musical spectrum of blues, it's his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings in the film that make watching and listening absolutely boring. The only highlight of the film is the interview of a Swedish couple who befriended J.B. Lenoir and showed off his private video footage as well as telling stories. Wenders' introduction to the film theme begins in a rather interesting way - alluding to the world culture (or, in fact, American culture) traveling in space, but his limited view on the subject, as well as the neither funny nor totally fascinating reproduction of stories 30's movie as a mere aid to sleep. To yawn. I expected more from him.
