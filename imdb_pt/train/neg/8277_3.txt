This may be unbelievable, but this movie grossed $ 878,138 in Russia! It is displayed in almost all cinemas and still running! Well, I have no idea why distributors put their eyes on this particular "movie", which had almost no screening across the world. That's some kind of puzzle! Haha! Maybe it was based on the fact that another movie, "Pledge This," with Paris Hilton, which also came out on DVD almost everywhere, had big shows in Russia and grossed more than $ 1 million. In addition, the two films had a lot of promotion, like the banners spread all over the city, commercials of TV and etc. Speaking of cinema, I would say it is boring and absolutely boring. It might be better actually. Even if you have Jessica Simpson.
