this movie was not quite what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie were called something else, no one would notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's really strange because I can not see the point. the prequel and the sequel just let it say that it does not make sense or combine. maybe I'm naive, but it's not a vol 1 & vol 2 that fits. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in jail in the 1st and dies in the original, and in the prequel he lives and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was OK but they should have changed around some actors and some of the story line and the name of the movie and it would have been a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really hoped it would end as the other began. <br /> <br /> If anyone has an opinion on this post, please.
