When thinking of captivity, many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, uninteresting, unsuspecting, non-sexy, unfathomable and unattainable. <br /> <br /> I used to hate those movies from the '90s to the mid' 90s which were basically Scream ripoffs, but these new imitations of Saw were starting. to make these movies look classics. They still value the same demographic that the other movies did so successfully, but now they add a new level of degeneracy that makes girls ages 12 to 14 destined to feel like hardcore and hip. This movie sucks sucky crap! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name has not been linked to anything good since 1993! Even so, I was still surprised to see that it had something to do with something so bad! Was anyone surprised when the film's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did not someone know when you first saw him? Just someone who never before in your life has ever seen another movie!
