The dubbing / translation in this film is frankly hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this zombie movie that otherwise is boring and derivative. I did not laugh so much in my life as I just watched Zombie 3 (and I've seen some very bad voiceovers in my life, believe me). Seriously, filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and earn millions of dollars. It's so funny. <br /> <br /> But ... If you fall off your couch laughing at dubbing in a Fulci zombie movie is not your cup of tea, then AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.
