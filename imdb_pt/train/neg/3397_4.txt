The trailer for this movie interested me enough to secure the DVD rental. However, the resulting film is absolutely terrible! Of course, this is not the worst movie ever made, or the worst movie this year, but it came very close! <br /> <br /> The main issue is the movie does not know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, suspense, teen porn? The story is interesting as it deals with the bridal traps by mail, but the movie is a mess. What starts as a slightly interesting "comedy" (a word I use in the vague terms possible), then goes totally the other way around, and degenerates into a very dark and nasty misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is lost! So did Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only assume to have done it for the money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in almost every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for all he did, and the dramatic elements are downright nasty. A movie to be avoided, unless you have to see Kidman or Chaplin in all your movies!
