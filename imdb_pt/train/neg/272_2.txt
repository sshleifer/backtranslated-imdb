When I was younger I really enjoyed watching bad television. We've all been guilty of it at some point or another, but my excuse to watch things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is this: I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worth it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, now I appreciate the good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. I, 12, would love every trivial detail, every line of dialogue flushed, every bit of unnecessary technobabble. The writing is beyond the insipid; so bland and uninspired that makes the lack of Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me anxious for the worst Trek show of all time, you're in trouble. The film Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, filled with fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful soundtrack and cool science fiction ideas. With the exception of a little bit of the original song, nothing that made the movie entertaining appears in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver watchable and Legend interesting, seems like he's half asleep in most episodes. <br /> <br /> The budget must have been too low, because sets sometimes look like someone's hold. Cinematography is not much better, as vanilla as the scripts. It surprises me that it shows in much more style (like Farscape) and substance (like the reinvented Battlestar Galactica) has smaller fan bases, less angry than this papanicolau. You just do not deserve it.
