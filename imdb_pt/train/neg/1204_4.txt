I remember Devil Dog playing TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching and laughing the next day. Not so bad for a horror movie made for TV, but it is derived (mainly from the Exorcist) and professional, for lack of a better word. This will not impress you with an artistic cinematography or a great performance, but neither is it a waste of time. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a few hours when you do not feel like thinking too much. <br /> <br /> However, if you go to the movies looking for a few laughs, you win. Do not be disappointed. The first scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cuddly puppy with Children of the Damned eyes, are hilarious and non-threatening, and the climatic effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) Are quite complicated. And watch out for the Satanist hooded in Maverick's masks toward the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's not a great horror movie by any stretch of the imagination, but I wish they still did things like that for TV.
