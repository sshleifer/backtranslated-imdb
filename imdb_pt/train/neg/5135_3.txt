I think the scarecrows are scary, so it's a shame that this movie does not make them anymore. <br /> <br /> A group of thieves makes an emergency parachute of an airplane in a huge field with scarecrows. One of them disappears with the sack and so the rest chases him while he is attacked by inexplicable scarecrows. The acting is hammy and the scarecrows do not impress (when they move). On the plus side, the director gets a little suspense with the static scarecrows. It's like Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb under a desk goes out, and that's a surprise. We know the bomb is under the table, but not when it's going to explode, and that's suspense."
