What can I say? I ignored the comments and went to see him alone. Damn the reviews were so good. What a waste of money considering the budget. <br /> <br /> Well, I went to see Kill Bill after that. <br /> <br /> To see a really scary movie, it would be the Crossroads! Bottom line-- I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than that crap.
