This movie had a lot of potential. Whoever went along with Jeffrey's story knows that there are so many neglected details in this movie that it's ridiculous. Much time and effort was spent on the film about Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. Where was the character development? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where in the movie does he approach his teenage years when he started killing and maiming little animals? Instead, we are giving a dizzying series of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but fail to address the main point of Dahmer's development. In addition, the reason the country was so intrigued by this story were the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he did to achieve this; his cannibalism and his desire for meat, etc. I could go on, but to summarize, many points behind the film, focused on your sexuality and not enough of the blood - the good things you'd expect to see when the title of the movie is "Dahmer."
