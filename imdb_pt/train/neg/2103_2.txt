Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on the wedding day, steals her body in her fake ambulance / hearse and takes home her dwarf assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep Bella's wife eternally young. Some second-rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible and terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi speaks very well, but you can tell that he needed the money. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely horrible, and most of the actors would have been better off waiting for tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell someone what happens and they tend to laugh a lot and require watching the movie. I got the DVD in a 2 disc store for Â£ 1, which I think is a fairly accurate rating, someone paying more so it would be out of their mind.
