Unless someone enlightens me, I really have no idea what this movie is. It looks like a picture with a message, but it's far from it. This film tells a useless story of a New York press officer and his problems. And that's basically everything. When this agent is played by Pacino, one should think that it should be something important. But it's not hard to think of how this movie is meaningless and tedious. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is "Simone") that deserves the title of "the most boring and meaningless film of the year". So, what's going on, Al?
