I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thinking they were cop cops. They are, but Busey is in the opening scene, so does not appear again until 40 minutes after the movie. Although every scene he is in is incredible. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind wanderer. <br /> <br /> What is incredible about this movie is the plot. In the film, Fred Williamson is trying to find out who is chasing and killing sex operators over the phone. At one point I think it's your Busey. But I happen to be partly right. Busey is not the killer, but he is calling and harassing the women on the phone. Because? I do not know. No way he's connected to the killer, he just does it for fun, I guess.
