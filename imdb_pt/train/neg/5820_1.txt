This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm studying French in college and so I understood all the dialogue, so the language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it is really difficult to empathize with any of the characters portrayed in the film. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I do not think there are any professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Although I rated 1 out of 10, it probably does not deserve such a bad rating. This is just a futile effort to reduce your current overall rating to 7.3 for something more realistic. Maybe 4.3 is a more accurate rating because the movie is a true event that lasts no more than 100 minutes and that you will never get back. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I'm sure some college student is busting his nut making a movie twice better and half the length. However, if you want to join the bandwagon that seems to be rolling around the IMDb, you might as well go ahead and give "Lost in Translation" to 10 as well.
