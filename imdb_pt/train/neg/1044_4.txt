"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of those lightweight, family-friendly movies that you can watch and crossword at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen to buy a club and a crown, you do not have to "pause" the DVD. Just let it roll, because you will not miss something really important. No twists, turns or tension. It's not really an ethnic movie, it's a movie about a poor immigrant family that is Latino. They could have been any ethnic group. That made little difference. I've seen it a zillion times before. Simply connect a Jewish family, an Italian family, a Black family or an Irish family. Only the accents and names were different. If the Vargas family called themselves Bush or Clinton and was a Presbyterian, the film would have been a complete nap. <br /> <br /> It's funny that the critics here could not understand the place. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some the Bronx and another Brooklyn. As a long-time New Yorker, I vote in the Lower East Side. And it seemed the family never met anyone other than other Latinos. They lived in a small isolated / isolated enclave. Some interaction with non-Latinos may have created some excitement, interest or tension. Remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> And now for cinematography often criticized. I do not know if it was my TV or what, but all the internal photos seemed very ORANGE to me. The apt, the furniture and the faces were all ORANGE. What should that mean? And the apt. it seemed too tight for me. Someone here mentioned that the old apt / tenements had very large bedrooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What the landowners did was split a large apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can for them. <br /> <br /> And another boring thing .... This is the second family movie I saw and criticized this week that featured a teenager "masturbating". Is this private sexual act necessary for us to watch? Please spare me! What about these directors? <br /> <br /> So, "Victor Vargas" is a nice little movie. It was good for a change to see young Latino actors giving time and a chance to show off their talents, what they did. But the writers let them down, giving them a flat writing and nothing spectacular to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers close to the "forward" button.
