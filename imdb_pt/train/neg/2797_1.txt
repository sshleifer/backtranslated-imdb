I'm a big fan of the horror genre! I love horror movies / slasher / gore of all kinds. Some of my favorites are the "good" bad horror movies. But this movie has nothing to justify its viewing !! I will not spend much time talking about everything that is wrong with this. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible. The acting is horrible. The FX is not worth discussing. The "set" is an absolute joke !! The sad thing is that I think there may be some real potential in a couple of actors, but this vehicle left them nothing to work with. <br /> <br /> Just say that I saw it by "free" and feel that I went Stolen !! The time you would be seeing this would be better spent using your cat.
