These 2 points are devoted to the reasonable performance of Akshay Kumar. I know Bollywood films do not strive to be realistic, but PLEASE, a production of Walt Disney is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what any good father does ... expel the son of the son with his wife PREGNANT. Some things that were very difficult to swallow - 1. Priyanka 'cool indoor pool in the room' and go from that hunger in your garden shed to laws ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the stunt job, was bitten by dogs grumpy, then just leave. This movie is an INSULT to our intelligence. I do not really believe that I contributed financially to the 'people' who made this movie taking my family to see it, we left the cinema with a scowl, please do not subject yourself to this mess to Watch this take my advice and do not waste your 'waqt'.
