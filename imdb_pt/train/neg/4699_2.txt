Wow, the band of the naked brothers. What should I say? I think I can say this show sucks. number one: they have no talent, they probably can not even play the instruments. number 2: not commercial, they said they were famous, but no one even heard of them until a fucking show popped up. Look, I really do not hate it so bad I would give it as a 4 out of 10 but what bothers me is how everyone says they have such great talent and Nat is so deep and writes deep letters. Deep my ass! he talks about hardcore fighters with intimate feelings. wow, I could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be deeper than that. And they did not become famous by themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and they wanted their children to be too, so they made a bad show. I get the feeling that it will be canceled soon.
