This was a horrible movie. Basically Jane March was a North Korean spy korean sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to American forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid of an American military family, they all consider her Korean, although she seems whiter (I believe the actress is 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian, not even a little Korean), and the adolescent in the house starts to hate her and ends up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the US military in Korea are portrayed is completely insane. Of course the scriptwriter and director obviously were white men who never spent a day in Korea before this movie and did not intend to show a real view of Korea to the Koreans or Americans and instead tried to fulfill their pathetic fantasies of Asiaphile, without any consideration of how utterly unbelievable he made the film. Anyone who's been to Korea knows this is crap. In the end, the spy-girl North Korean honhyol is dead, in an obvious "paying for her sins". Very bad movie with a TV touch to it.
