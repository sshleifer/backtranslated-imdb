the directors' intention for these films is quite honorable, but their story of their productions made me realize that this may not take very seriously as other filmmakers would do. Keeping in mind its great 30-day television series but also counting on its MTV production "I bet it goes" that opposes its seriousness in any of the subjects it documents and also relying on its rather disappointing production "supersize me" hopes high. unfortunately, this movie disappointed me, however. as with "supersize me" after a while I wondered what exactly the point of all this was. The main statement is clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the playground is filled with useless things and repetitions that have already been shown this way or another earlier in the film, so it wears out and gets extremely annoying the end.
