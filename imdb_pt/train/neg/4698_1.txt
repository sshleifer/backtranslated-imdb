I mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car? So if its ten, it's too immature for a child to sing about "being my women", I mean seriously! Is the name too cheesy, nude brothers? just because they take off their pants ??? HOW CREATIVE. I do not understand why they need a TV show, I mean most artists do not really need a TV show about themselves, especially the bare brothers band. Heck how many of them are in the party freaking out. And seriously what happens to the movie? Jeez Nick used to be the hightlight of my growing years, but seriously The band of the naked brother? So many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the band name of Naked Brother, it's a stupid, uncreative show that should not be on TV.
