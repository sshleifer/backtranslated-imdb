Unlike the two other current programs of the endemol USA (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100), the pace in this show is very slow for what is happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 Vs. 100 can go off at a slow pace because games can change pace - or end - at any time. There is risk involved in every action the player takes, rewards are very variable and it is difficult for players to come out with a significant amount of money. Suspense is usually well used. <br /> <br /> Show Me The Money, on the other hand, is very slow. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. It would greatly help the rhythm of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST, and then the player will choose a dancer instead of wasting time talking about what will happen if the player goes wrong when everyone knows they are right. Random dancing is a filler that really looks like a filler. A lot of time is wasted while it is not happening enough ... and the fact that players can not choose to leave the game early ensures that there will be plenty of time lost. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I'm NOT interested in watching Shat stir your thang groove, especially soon after I have eaten dinner. <br /> <br /> I'm a lifelong show fan, but even I've had a lot of trouble sitting for an hour from this. Or needs major changes or early retirement.
