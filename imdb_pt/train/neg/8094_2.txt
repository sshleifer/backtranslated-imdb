As someone who read the novel and watched the movie, I have a different view on why the film was so flawed. First, any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably a satire, but comes as a cross between tragedy and controversy. Any comic elements, such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the film version, are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical impulse. And for the author's omnipresent white suit to fool you into thinking this is another Mark Twain, think again. A more appropriate literary precedent would be the Ambrose Bierce spectrum in a top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is equal in share clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new grains for his self-absorbed mill. <br /> <br /> So it is no wonder that the excellent production and directing skills produced in the film's production were doomed from the start. Contrary to true satire, which translates very well into film, the polemics are not based on universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior, but on a stubborn attack on specific people - whether real straw men or fictional men - who have somehow gained the wrath of the writer. Any effort to create a story or narrative successfully filmed from such a beginning must have a clean beginning, free from the influence or interference of the writer. <br /> <br /> That said, I also think the cast is guilty. It's not just that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith can not measure themselves up, but real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures. There is enough topical material here for a truly great cinema satire, but it does not even come close.
