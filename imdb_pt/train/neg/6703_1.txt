I noticed that this movie suffered many insults. Probably won some of them, but it was not that bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, it tried to tell a story. As a drama, this movie could work very well indeed. I just think the filmmakers lost track of the way to go when they did it (they should have added more funny parts if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite, it could have been a great movie. But, as a satire, it did not work in its current form - many scenes did not fit the context of the plot: for example, the robbery scene makes little sense in history. Still, it was not the worst independent film ever - is it in the Top 10 Worst? That is debatable.
