And I thought The Beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for the horrible script, if anyone can make any sense of what the hell was the purpose of that movie, pat him on the back. It's a cross between The Village and a poor quality script. It kind of starts out drawing attention, and then, as you progress through the plot, that does not make sense, and do not make me start talking about the end !!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is the great humor of Nicolas Cage, and his ability to be funny in the strangest situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, spare five bucks and go home and turn it on fire and when someone asks you why, just say the stupidest thing that comes to your mind, and there you go!
