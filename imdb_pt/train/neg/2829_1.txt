The worst, and full of people who really should know better (the cast has six Oscars in between). It is set in "contemporary" Africa (it was made in 1979) and deals with the slave trade. It is terribly scripted and acted, (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden achieve a low career in this), and completely devoid of excitement, no matter what moral focus. It is also ridiculously traced. You do not believe for one minute that any of the characters would behave the way you do under those circumstances. Richard Fleischer drives, but you get the impression that it was over the phone. This is as bad as it sounds.
