The premise of this expected sequel was very good and after the huge success of the remake I waited very sincerely. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept. The situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is really horrible. <br /> <br /> This time there are no characters or violins similar to the remake. Also, the blood is not as plentiful and when it does it is really bad. <br /> <br /> Violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think there is room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team that's hunting down a family of mutant cannibals. You certainly expect something different! When I watched the movies, I wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a clear example of how hurried movies end up becoming a mess and show poor quality in every respect. <br /> <br /> A mess that disappointed fans of the remake like me. That is why the sequences are never welcome; at least this movie is not as terrible as the 1985 sequence of the original.
