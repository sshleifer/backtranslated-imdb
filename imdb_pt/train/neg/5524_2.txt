I did not like this movie for numerous reasons. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I was extremely disappointed and I came to the conclusion that if this movie were to be saved, at least for me, it would have to come out of the huge hole I had dug. . Unfortunately, this did not occur. The two draws of the movie for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work because she was interested in what she would bring to the film. After that, I felt disappointed and for all three, although there were "moments" in each of his performances. I imagine that for each of them finding their "moments" was a very difficult task, given the fact that there was an incredible lack of character development and uninspired dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the film in general is so poorly written, directed and edited that the performance of anyone as an actor would suffer and be contaminated by it. The disrespectful way he dealt with sexual abuse and the banal and insulting view of small-town America, I think, were the two main reasons why this movie failed to reach its mark. As one reviewer noted and I agree, the film is almost impossible to market since it is finished. I suspect this, or at least hope (for the actor's sake anyway) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor. Sad to us, but if this is true then the actors can comfort themselves with it and feel a little good at lending their talents and time to such a failure. Ah yes and another thing ... I wished that only once could I go see an American movie that included the sadly disappeared but wonderfully bucolic scenarios like the one in this movie where the main characters were not distracted and / or disrespectfully side of the country with pop cans, broken CDs and other junk like that!
