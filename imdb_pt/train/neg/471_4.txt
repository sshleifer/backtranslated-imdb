An obsolete saga of "misfit in the army," which attempts to be surrealistic (the foreign legends) and vulgar (the gags of flatulence), but ends up being a mixture of many different types of humor, of them followed with much success. Barbara Bach, the Bond Girl of "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
