Why such a generic title? Santa Claus??? So bland and unpredictable. Films before that tried to make money on the Christmas spirit, most notably "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians", at least it was fun to watch because of the country weather, and all the footage being used ... for some reason, it seemed happy for me. But this movie just tightens up Christmas in the ass and squeezes the joy of all the kids. Does Santa live in space? Is your enemy a demon named Pitch? Does Santa get help from Merlin the Magician? How random is that? Well, since it was made in Mexico, some of you can understand how the film was made. I had to admit that some of the effects were crazy for the time. It was a cluster of follies! Despite all the problems with the film, it still looks like a Christmas movie. Good conquers evil, and Christmas is still part of our heart to every good girl or boy in the world, or possibly the universe, thanks to Santa Claus Conquer the Martians ... apparently. So, I guess you should try it even if it's one of the worst vacation movies ever ... though you should put a smile on your face any day.
