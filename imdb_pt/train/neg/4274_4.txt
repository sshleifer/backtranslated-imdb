We are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor. We can confess the truth of what we see, without being stupid, to confess that this spectacle is in many respects simply incomprehensible and that of course much of it was created from pure intuition, with no real concept. <br /> <Well, of course, many people like these things. I do not. I prefer well thought out and planned shows. And I also confess, that the show is very seriously for my taste and annoying ... these love and drug stories ... There are so many exciting soaps with a lot of suspense (Dallas, for example), but Twin Peaks can not pick up My attention. I do not care about these people except Cooper and Gordon Cole.
