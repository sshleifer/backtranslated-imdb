WOW! Why would anyone make a sequel to an already rancid movie? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least it had an idea of ​​what it wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. It just exists on the screen for reasons I can not explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is as follows: Twitch (played by Tha Dogg Pound's Kurupt) is transferred to another chain where there may be a box full of buried gold bricks. In jail, a riot breaks out between rival prisoners, one of them is shot by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape. During a marriage visit, Twitch's fiancee and Burke's daughter (played by Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and kept in an execution room. Burke reluctantly befriends Twitch and they end up getting in trouble with the idiot prisoners while they discover that Cortez has their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Opinion: This is the most unnecessary sequel since the Universal Soldier: The Return. The script is terrible, the acting is horrendous, the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a caricature. Look, I know it was a low-budget movie, but that's no excuse for these guys not trying hard at what they do. No one in this "movie" believes the characters they interpret. No one in this movie can be taken seriously as an actor. Kurupt should be ashamed of himself. His character "Twitch" is practically a puppet of little boys who spend most of the time posing while Burke or the other inmates. Bill Goldberg spends most of his time in a bad mood throughout the film as if he had to do a PHD (gigantic fighting scenes). The fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an HPD2 action movie is very annoying even when the action is happening! Do not let anyone tell you that this movie is rather decent, it stinks and is the main reason why people despise Follywood.
