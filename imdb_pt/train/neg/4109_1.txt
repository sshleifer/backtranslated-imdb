It can only be described as horrible. It's bad to start and it gets even worse. When you start, you really have to watch it because it is impossible to believe that it can get worse - but do not be afraid because it happens. Another poorly written screenplay for a donkey director for untold kids of movie stars of the past. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than acting or if the direction is worse than both. As for the hero - well, he sings everyone, including a scene in which he hits the daylights, opening the closet door and breaking it against the window with her. And in another scene he is thrown through a window and falls 20 feet into the concrete - he does not blink - then gets up immediately and gets stuck in the bad guys. This is a really ridiculous movie. Lucky that only cost me $ 1 to hire.
