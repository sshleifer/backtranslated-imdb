"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad mood that has a bad guy in a bad way up to his crates in quick-drying concrete. While we wait for the cement to dry and the film find out what it is, we are periodically retracted in time, without rhyme or reason, so that we can attend events that have led to the cement thing. A boring junk movie, "Cement" suffers from the lack of a story, a clumsy execution, and the most omnipresent of film failures; There is no reason to care. A time killer for the sofa potato needed at best. (D +)
