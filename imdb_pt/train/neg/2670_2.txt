There's no way you care about these characters. A bunch of spoiled middle-class kids take some drugs at a party and go out together and argue. I just saw it on TV and did not think it was a 'movie' as such, plus a post-'Life 'indulgence that does not really have resonance or drama fit for it. Things of this sort will be commissioned by time immemorial, unfortunately, an irrelevant middle-class "lifestyle" crap that takes itself too seriously. There's David Baddiel and that bird from "Cold Feet," you know what to expect. There was a lot about it in 2000, it was a particularly British malaise ... "are they educated and do drugs? Friends, but kind of dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships? Sounds great!" That kind of nonsense, and stuff from comedy and gangster post-Guy Ritchie ... dark days. If you like it, it will irritate you to the point of violence.
