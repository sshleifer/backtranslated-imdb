What a terrible, terrible movie! One of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, the whole. "A guy meets an eccentric woman he likes, but he's already involved with someone who is not right for him ..." I expected something predictable and I did not care. Movies are always fun mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this one! Every joke falls and "romance" makes me want to vomit. The title character is one of the most "please kill me" characters I've ever seen on my television, the "eccentric woman" is not very eccentric, more like peculiar and irritating. The "other someone" is the most reasonable and mature person in this movie, but it's also annoying. This movie sucks, there's no way, do not waste your time.
