More than 20 years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I've ever seen. The Scandinavian ninjas silently enter a scene, shoot their noisy, noisy submachine guns with a savage abandon and then quietly leave. Wow, how are we going to find these silent invisible killers? Just follow the capsules and smoke! Painfully bad dialogue (or was it brilliant and just mistranslated?), Not an Asian spot in the cast, and a massive total of 3 Asians among the stunt staff. The plot is ridiculous, the acting virtually nonexistent - then again, ninja can not act! Save yourself - avoid watching at all costs!
