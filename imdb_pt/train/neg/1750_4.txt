HERA PHERI by Priyadarshan was a good situational comedy. This film, however, does not really have a story, but it's quite funny but illogical. <br /> <br /> In fact they are not a proper story, but they get a good flow. The first half has 2 funny scenes like the one where Akshay and John invite Neha for lunch and another when Paresh comes in. <br /> <br /> The first half becomes boring slowly, but the second half is funnier than they do are no script <br /> <br /> Jokes are funny, though ask yourself how they never hear the voices of every person from within the rooms? <br /> <br /> The climax confusion is treated as one but the movie abruptly ends <br /> <br /> The direction is right The music is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar excels in his part that has now become his second skin but that is his movie completely and he overshadows all the others <br /> <br /> John stumbles and fails the comedy Paresh Rawal is hilarious Rajpal is well The girls are tall and sometimes and strange also Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu is seen now) are good in parts, but they scream very often Manoj Joshi is well
