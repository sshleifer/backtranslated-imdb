Yes, definitely better than my view of Death Tunnel. In fact, some of the deaths were very original and the blood was decent. It was as if Wrong Turn knew Hills Have Eyes. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When "high school or college?" are discussing horror movies in the kitchen, everything Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream (1996). The thing about the big-boobs girls, etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Steve was NOT a Scream Pirate Randy? 3) In addition to the fact that it happened in October, what the heck did the movie have to do with Samhain? Very unnecessary if you ask me. I find it funny when I see those 80's horror movies that explain loose ends pointing fingers at druids or a pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow, they did a reference from Sam Raimi !!! 5.) Why was Gary and his sister in the movie? They are characters had nothing to do with anything. And is he so psychic that he could not even see his own death? 6.) When Gary was being killed in the bathroom (at that point, the deaths became simply Tromas-licious), how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs, but did not hear them when she was outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis - this is basically a Scottish dish, not Irish. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson is if you're like Shae and do not amuse yourself or smile the whole movie, will you be the one to live? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like chilli meat dishes. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, did they forget that Steve was stuck there and wondered where he went? 11.) Was there more than one killer? Shae hit that one, but never found any of them. <br /> <br /> 12.) What happened to the flashbacks to other people? Half of them, Shae, did not know if they were alive or dead, so what was with that? 13.) Why did not they kill Gary and his sister before? 14.) Why did not anyone ever call the police? And apparently everyone knew that these people lived in the forest, why did not they ever organize some kind of attack? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies or vampires - so how could she turn into one in the end? I'm with everyone on the giant "huh?" in the end. <br /> <br /> Better than the death tunnel, but still rather sloppy. I still do not understand why they put him in Ireland, considering that Samhain had almost nothing to do with the plot.
