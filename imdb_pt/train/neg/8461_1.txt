I did not know that Willem Dafoe was so difficult for the dollars that he would be disgraced by such a disturbance in this monstrosity. Hell: I'm going to donate the money I would send to Ethiopia if he was so desperate. I've never seen such a pathetic and disgusting movie for a long time ... who paid for it? They are wanting some fiscal or insane blow. A 5-year-old would be ashamed of the plot, and I'd rather have cancer than sit longer than the time I've already suffered. Everyone involved should be locked up for a year in the sodomy ward of a third world prison. Avoid at all costs. I would give less 10 if possible ... unbelievable.
