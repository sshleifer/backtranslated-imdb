For me it only comes out as a novel. I think any representation of wasteful people can be considered "social commentary". But in the final analysis, I just do not care how you characterize this movie. None of the characters are very friendly or engaging. I did not feel chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, you are lost in your unease. And despite the turnaround provided by Dorothy Maguire's complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) reversal on the witness stand, the story is not enough to keep my interest. No matter how Freudian symbolism and psychology are cast, this story is despicable, melodramatic and banal. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is nobly made of wood. This is the less engaging role of Lauren Bacall and one of her poorer performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack feature more inspired performances, but their character is vile, and he's pathetic. Robert Keith, as the loving father, out of touch with two malicious adult children, is the nicest character. Most interesting of all, however, is Robert Grake, who looks stern, in a small role as owner of the bar. He is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerners, but here he is an honest and lovable fellow. <br /> <br /> I take my social commentary with an interesting and engaging story and some friendly characters, thank you.
