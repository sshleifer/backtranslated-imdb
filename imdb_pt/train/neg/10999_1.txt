Imagine the worst skits on Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90-minute movie. Now imagine that all the humor in those bad sketches is removed and replaced by stupidity. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Do you understand? <br /> <br /> Ok, now go see The Underground Comedy Movie. That vision you just had will look like the funniest thing ever. UCM is the worst movie I've ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs ... very few. But it was lame. Even if the movie's intention was to be lame, it was too dumb to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not mad about wasting my time watching this was someone else I know who bought it. He lost his money. Vince Offer did not write or direct anything else and it's not surprising why.
