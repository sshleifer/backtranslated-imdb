Let's get right to the point: this softcore porn movie is marketed to the masses with a name that the studio is milking every last dime out of American Pie pie. Period. <br /> <br /> The entire plot (and this should not imply that there is too much to go around) serves as a vehicle to show the public more breasts and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're a Tween guy, and you're too scrupulous to buy real porn, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, the movie does not have much to offer. <br /> <br /> The acting is unsatisfactory, the character's development is virtually nonexistent, and the story is an absurdity of nudity, drunkenness. and jokes (none of them particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Go buy real porn if that's what you want to see, and if not, go watch a good movie. Animal House, Kids, or even the original American Pie are all great cinematographic works, and all contain heavy use of alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not how much, how you use it"
