Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little heavy metal, you saw internal jokes all over the place. If you know anything about pornography, this fake documentary will leave you cold. Everything in it is false. <br /> <br /> Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it to the top. This movie is decidedly not funny because it shows an image of how pornography is done that has no relation to the real world. <br /> <br /> The acting here is uniformly awful, but that would not matter much if the main idea of ​​the movie was good. But not that.
