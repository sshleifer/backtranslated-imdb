I do not know where to start. This movie looks a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows they used to do in the late eighties in the early nineties. Sort of like Captain Power or the Power Rangers. It's full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy "secret agencies" and villains. <br /> <br /> The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The direction is terrible and there is little for continuity. It seems that someone just played a lot of scenes and forgot that it should be a plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes of the film is in the beginning, when several villains plant an explosive device in an agent's car. For some reason, even if the device is clearly stated to be "detonated remotely", the thugs decide to chase it on their motorcycles as it moves away. This persecution continues. all the time with the bad guys doing absurd and completely useless bicycle stunts. Getting up on bikes, doing wheelies and so on. At one point, an accident happens and one of the attackers is thrown from his motorcycle, we see the bike (clearly cgi) thrown over the agent's car, but the pilot disappeared. Then, a few seconds later, the cyclist and the bike return ... apparently unharmed by the accident. At this point, even if the car has an explosive device, the attackers choose to shoot the agent while they pass through it and then blow up the car. Which was also clearly done with CGI. Sound confusing? Yeah, and so is the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I could say that when I say cgi, we're not talking about Lord Of The Rings type cgi here. We're talking about cheap cheap Power Rangers cgi type, actually I think we would have been better at Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savini and Todd made this movie I'll never know, I can only assume that they did for money, as a favor to someone or because they were blackmailed to him ... probably the last.
