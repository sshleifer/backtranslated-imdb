This was a rip-off from the same crap that we had to watch Bob Saget host for half an hour before that. Dave Coulier just thought he was funny and was pretty much the same show as America's Funniest Home Videos, except with the hosts who had a IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen must have really needed the money and Coulier had to go to the bin for his jokes. It was torture enough to see him imitate Popeye and other cartoons in Full House. That guy who played all the pranks of the world deserves to be on the tip of a wedge of Grade A. Coulier must have needed money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
