This is really bad. Lamas shows how a second-rate actor does his job. But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ in anger grabs a fellow police officer by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the letter "I have the evidence in you!". (It makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I could not find it on iTunes). Talk about seeing the future ... Very funny for words. The rest of the film is forgettable. The score and the songs are more interesting than the script. I give the sequel. Which raises the question of why they would do a continuation. My understanding is that foreign sales drive many of these B movies. It does not say much about the world's viewing habits.
