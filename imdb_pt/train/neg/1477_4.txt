I saw Dolemite and also (Avenging) Godfather Disc, two other works from the blaxploitation cannon of our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this movie, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will always have a special place in my heart. Out of sheer nonsense, lack of skill in filmmaking and absolute enthusiasm (frankly a little too much), The Human Tornado can not be surpassed. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old friend Dolemite is living with a white woman when some angry local cops invade the house without good reason, and you do not know it! The woman in bed with ol Dole is none other than the sheriff's wife. Her cry when she sees him: "He made me do it!" Dolemite's cry: "& $ * @ $ are you really ???" Subtlety has never been your strong point. <br /> <br /> Highlights? The cameo of a very young Ernie Hudson (of the fame of the Ghostbusters), the errors of continuity (characters looking to one side and another in the next, Dolemite suit changing color in each scene of the nightclub act), and Demonic Queen Bee's eyes on her first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the man really think he looked cool in this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you have to admire the enthusiasm he has. If he is jumping totally naked from a cliff, or barking orders to his gang in rhyme (eg: Quick! In the cave! I have a plan to let that mother $ * @ (% & dig his own grave!) Man commits Certainly he goes to sea, never more than any other time he is doing kung fu. The climactic battle is filmed at high speed, but occasionally slows down to let Rudy pose and close his teeth. I'm not sure if they wanted to see as well if they had accelerated the movie as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe it was so fast, in any case, "Matrix" is not. <br /> <br /> Human tornado, much like the original Dolemite is a movie incompetent, but at least it's fun, and you certainly have to give credit to these people for the effort, not much, enjoy with my warm recommendations.
