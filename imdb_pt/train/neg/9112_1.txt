Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intentions 1, again, just barely made. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and luring me to watch it, I ended up feeling dirty, because it compares to watching a soft-core porn. I'm not sure if I should blame some of the idiot lines of the actors or writers ... and I always feel bad saying that because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically a waste of my life. It literally amazes me that some movies are made, and that's no exception ... I can not believe they would do a third.
