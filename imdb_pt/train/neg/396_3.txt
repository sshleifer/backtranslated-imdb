I saw this when I was in the theater, it started so strong that I mean in 1980 that this was a daring movie and the special effects were great right now. Now you would have to have been at least 30 or more in 1980 to really understand this point because studying films historically loses the mentality at the time when expectations and other psychological factors related. Now, as I said, the movie was engaging in suspense and a lot of fun. It builds up to an excellent climax then .... Ends I mean the person who described him as having a water balloon in his hand before playing it, besides being a very poetic description. In my experience, it was not strong enough. My wife and I were well ... how can I say that? We were upset, I mean we paid money, we invested the time to watch the movie which was great. "We both felt we were stolen with an ending that convinced us that the production company must run out of money and could not get up enough to finish it properly. In fact, my wife said it was better, not over, just over stop!
