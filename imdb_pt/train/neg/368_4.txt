This movie is really silly! I saw him at 11 years old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would recommend this movie only for children under 12 years. I do not really care, but I think he answers a few very good questions that kids need to know, like: 1) Does money buy? happiness? 2) Should I lie (to my parents) about things I do not think they would approve of? 3) Money buys friendships? 4) Money is everything? 5) Should not I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? Surely these are very unrealistic situations, but I think if parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video too, to show / scare their kids that lies have the potential to hurt him.
