The Discovery Channel / Animal Planet should be ashamed of you. This fantasy is modeled after the series "Walking with Dinosuars". Even if this is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing the fantasy dragons with the T-rexs and the extinction of the dinosaurs. Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of saying Sci-Fi gives an air of factual authenticity to this show. <br /> <br /> By itself, the show is about a 7.5 / 10 far as the entertainment goes. But the way it is presented I have to give a 1/10. Do not get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy, but the way they put it is so wrong. I can actually see children and adults slow believing that they have found a dragon and that this is real. <br /> <br /> I also think that this weakens the great series "Walking with Dinosuars" because now you have to see this. with an idea of ​​how much is fantasy in that miniseries.
