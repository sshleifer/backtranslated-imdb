This is an atrocious movie. Two young demented girls seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to offer in relation to a plot or a spoiler. I would just comment that the ending is almost the most absurd part of the movie. Much of the film involves Locke and Camp chuckling, all the while smiling psychotically at the camera. Add to it a soundtrack that repeats over and over again, including a Vaudevilian song about "dear old father," which suggests an incestuous quality that the viewer never sees. The music is annoying at first, then ends up subjecting the viewer to a worse torture than the one shown on the screen. The theme here is crazed youth, understandable as a reaction to the 60's, but made with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
