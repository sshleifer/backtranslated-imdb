This is the first of these "8 Movies to Die" collection that I have seen and certainly did not make me want to see any of the rest ... although I have heard at least a couple of them are decent. I do not know, that was not terrible, but it did not do much for me. Their basic dysfunctional cannibal family in the suburban kind of thing, Mom and Dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), Where they continued to bring home food supplies to the street whenever possible. The best part of this was the creepy gothic sister, who naturally invites a friend from school who never leaves. Anyway, of course we have a butcher in the basement and so on. This family is like the white bread version of the Sawyer Clan, they are nasty and do bad things, but they do not go soulless. I see a lot of comments from people who liked this, and I guess I do not know what I missed, but I found it to be very mediocre and I would not recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10.
