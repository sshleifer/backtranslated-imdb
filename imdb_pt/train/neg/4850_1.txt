Some unrealistic movie spoilers included. <br /> <br /> From real life experiences, this movie continued to disappoint from the outset. I am currently deployed on my second visit to Iraq as an infantry man. This movie has nothing close to what would happen in real life events. From the beginning to name a few: the pump cart, EOD elements rolling solo without escorts, Sergeant EOD sneaking out of VBC, having sleeves rolling all the time in ACUs, where I had to give up on my haji Copy of 2 dollars, the sniper scene. The list would continue, however, it is unnecessary to list the wrong things happening with a time interval of 2 minutes before anything else is incorrect; and the point was made. <br /> <br /> This film is for people and critics to see that they have no understanding or experience with developments or with the military. <br /> <br /> People with military experience or knowledge of the military will be disappointed by the imprecision.
