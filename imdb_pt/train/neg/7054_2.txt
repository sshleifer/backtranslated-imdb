This movie was absolutely pathetic. An unfortunate script and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drooling over bikini girls. Sometimes I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I could not even sit through the movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is nothing impressive. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only important part of the film is the parody of Anu Malik and his obsession with shayaris. It was very hilarious. The songs "Sini Ne" and its remix version were very good. You can always rely on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, it looks like Emran does not have a good Bhatt script to support him this time around.
