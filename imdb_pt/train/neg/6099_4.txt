This was a less thrilling short film I recently saw among Turner Classic Movies. While the film came about due to its very intense Technicolor, the film itself was not as moving and sometimes the plot seemed very tacky - as this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience not even one consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the movie things were repeated - like when the characters talked to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "Ma'am," "Miss Barton," or "Clara." In addition, a sickly Confederate soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, A Confederate, a Rebel ..." - almost as if he were the cartoon character Mojo Jojo of the Powerpuff Girls. This was just a sloppy writing - period. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" on the TV show SUPERMAN) bearded as President Garfield. Yes, it's under that beard.
