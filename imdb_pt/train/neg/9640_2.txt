I've always been curious about this movie because it's so hard to find, so when I came across it on Ebay I forked over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it's so rare! This film is so bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the final credits, which show all the scenes where they got in the way of their lines, are literally the highlight of the movie. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, for an obvious reason, his topless scene), who uses his powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into that reality. When she pulls some type of box as an object, the military casually tosses it into the open back of a truck with a soldier to guard it, and, what do you know? SURPRISE! A boy with a rubber foam costume appears, instantly kills the soldier with a scratch on his face, then flees to a nearby town. But instead of mobilizing half the county's military to find him and protect the public, just let Pettyjohn and Ray find him on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all their LONG credibility before that. That only escapes being voted for me just because of unintentional laughter, someone needs to alert the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not already know it! 2 out 10, really, really bad!
