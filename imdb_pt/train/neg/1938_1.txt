Where to start? <br /> <br /> # 1 Amitabh's son, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30 years old. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in prison for over 33 years ... he <br /> <br />) Telepathically sent the sperm home? <br /> <br /> B) Did you ask a good Pakistani guard to send you to him? <br /> <br /> C) Allow conjugal visits in secret Pakistani prisons <br /> <br /> D) All of the above <br /> <br /> E) The producers were having a little too much bhang <br /> <br /> When did they approve the script? <br /> <Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanna - he's yum, yum, yummy ... and apparently he wants her - who does not, right ?! ... But when her father is expelled, and then killed (I hardly think this is a 'spoiler' as you would have to be brain dead and blind not to see it coming in the movie) he is well without emotion for this catastrophe and with the (metaphorically) tip of her hat, leaves her behind to save her father, no matter her loss, and says (paraphrasing) "God willing, we will meet again" ... Basically meaning " I'm going to get my dad d my work done, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- callus beyond the low-life standards of Hollywood ... # 3) There are so many holes in this horrible loss of time called movie, you can drive all the jeeps, camel trucks and anything extra through it Pass - really, complete and total waste of time - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes, only one - as in the dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dancing - but not worth Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan take acting classes? ) for best Indo-Pak conflict films ... In fact, Veer-Zaara is very good - 7.5 / 8 I would say!
