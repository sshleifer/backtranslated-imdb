I loved the original story, had very high expectations for the movie (especially since Barker was talking about it in interviews), I finally saw and what can I say? It was a total MESS! The direction is everywhere, the acting was atrocious, the flashy visuals and choreographies were simply flat, empty and completely unnecessary (what about generic video clip techniques such as fast-forward-slow mo nonsense?) It was rather stylish, but did not need this movie and cheapened the vibe in some MTV video Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo). Although some of the killings are pretty cool and brutal, some are ridiculously ridiculous (the Japanese girl's first death was hilarious and Ted Raimi's death was stupidly funny). He simply runs all over the place with zero tension and suspense, moving away entirely from the original storyline and then coming back to it at the end, which at that point just seems to be spoiled even further. No explanation was given, that is, I knew what was going on just as I had read the story, but for people who did not it is even more confusing as sometimes I did not even know where I was going and what I was trying to to do - an insane tangent was going on all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted to like this movie because I'm a big fan of Barker's work and I loved the story because it has an immense potential for a thunderous movie, hell I even liked some of the movies of Kitamura as fun jokes, but this movie just smelled of amateurism and nonsense from start to finish - I did not care about anything or anything, the whole thing was rushed and severely cut from the real source, turning it into something completely different. Granted it was bloody and Vinnie Jones played a superb badass, but everything else went all over the place, more than disappointing. Eviscerated
