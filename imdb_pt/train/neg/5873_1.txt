I do not know what they were thinking. By them, I mean, anyone remotely connected to that mess. I've seen such bad movies, I've seen such bad movies, and then there's that. But I'll tell you. Anyone who wrote the script was able to put what could possibly be the most stupid dialogue written on the screen. film, either from a technical point of view or from any other point of view.which allowed it to be made and then The launch must have been fired immediately. There are some well-known names in this film. In fact, I hesitate to use the word movie.it is more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less than 0 sense.anyway. I do not see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this. I find this really cheap, and I'm still stolen. Even if I had gotten this movie for free, I still would have been stolen. 0/10
