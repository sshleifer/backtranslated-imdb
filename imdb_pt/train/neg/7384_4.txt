STAR CLASSIFICATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a reconnaissance mission along with three new recruits of attack teams after disobeying a direct order from above. However, the night before the attack, all are found massacred by a murderer with seemingly inhuman force. With French police toying with his own investigation, he goes in search of those responsible, only to discover a corrupt faction of the military dealing with a new deadly drug that alters a person's DNA and gives them a new terrifying force. <Br /> Bad cover. Bad title. Bad post-production tampering. And bad trailer. Very bad movie. But, I have to say, I do not think Attack Force is his worst. I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here (maybe not Steveday!), But I think a lot of the criticisms have originated from all the bad news that went before the movie, rather than the quality itself. I must say that there was not even a dubbing or ropey issue as I was led to believe. The dubbing there was (which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) It was quite awful and quite frequent, but it was not used in such a large segment of the movie as I thought. The plot flowed very well, considering all the mess of the original film called Harvester, which continued. In addition, as another reviewer noted, the film has a beautiful gothic look, a new twist to a Seagal movie. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst point of killing, however, was the complete and total lack of any exciting action. , with just a few badly filmed fight scenes for any fun. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, however, I'd rather watch this again than Flight of Fury, Today you die or go out to kill. **
