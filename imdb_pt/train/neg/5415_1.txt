Dil was a memorable film that brought to the celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The film was followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti, all excellent. <br /> <br /> But every successful director makes some horrible movies with some successes. Pyare Mohan is one such film. <br /> <br /> Although the comedies are well told, they can not laugh at the viewer. Compared to the kind of comedy movies being made today, that's stupid. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please do not watch it. Because pathetic comedy will make you cry alone. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is worth losing.
