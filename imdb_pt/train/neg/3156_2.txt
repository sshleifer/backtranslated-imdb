I just want to make one thing clear, I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really disappoints him. His acting is still superb, he is still charming as ever, and he still looks great. But the movie itself is a load of crap! Natasha Henstridge, sorry for saying this, comes a little manly ... you're constantly waiting for her to run away with her best friend, who's own sub-storyline is a little weird. Me and my family (who sat and watched the movie with me) were also put off by the soundtrack of the film; sometimes the song simply did not fit what was happening in the scenes. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I found to be a very disappointing movie. I could forgive the fame of the protagonist, I could forgive the weird characters who were thrown into the mix, and I could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment, but the choice was to cut across the middle section of the film. and jump straight to the end ??? The end was obviously planned from the beginning, but as it gets there, it is not counted. If you are a fan of Michael Vartan, you can skip this movie: buy a poster instead.
