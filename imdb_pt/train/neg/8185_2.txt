Oh my. I decided to go out to the theaters with some friends, wanting to watch one of these Christmas movies, and I leave in anger. The movie failed. End. Paul Giamatti, who I consider a good actor, played his character and rolled horribly along with Vince Vaughn, who has always been one of my favorites. They try to turn a Christmas movie into a new style. Kind of evil, mixed with good, but everything turned out very wrong. The first ten minutes were not so bad, but once we saw Santa Claus, it was over. Not improved, the rate remained the same, there was no character development, and it certainly is one of the worst Christmas films ever invented. Do not watch, whatever you do.
