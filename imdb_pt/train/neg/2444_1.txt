Two houses, a street, a phone booth, a car, a girl next door, a kid next door, and a zombie. This list of ingredients should be enough for a great horror movie. All you need is some light blue, ambient music and ... done. Not in the hands of the Dutch director van Rouveroy though! <br /> <br /> I like to organize "bad movie nights" from time to time. The concept is very simple: drink a little, get some friends movie lovers and immerse yourself in the worst that the cinema can offer. For such a night, this peace of dirt is one of the best. Laughter guaranteed! <br /> <br /> The most bizarre is that van Rouveroy still defends his film as if it were a great achievement. To be a witness to this, you will have to listen to the comment track of the DVD. Once again: disbelieve and laugh guaranteed!
