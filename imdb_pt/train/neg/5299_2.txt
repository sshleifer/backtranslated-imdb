I really like slasher movies, but this one is really horrible. The acting is lame, the script is bad, and the atmosphere is nonexistent. The plot is as follows: a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughtering people in a small American town. That's the plot. Very original, huh! "The Night Bring Charlie" is not even bloody enough - if the movie is not going to be scary, at least they should make it bloody. Avoid this cheap piece of junk at all costs. If you want to see some good slasher movies, check out " Madman "," The Burning "," The Prowler "," Just Before Dawn "or" Humongous "- just do not waste your precious time on this useless piece of junk.
