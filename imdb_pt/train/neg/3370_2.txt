Just a dumb old movie. Stanwyck's first child gets stuck in a really stupid way, and then her husband gets stuck in another really stupid way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck is unhappy once again and comes across a convicted fugitive. She has the chance to kill him, but fails in a very stupid way. In the end, her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us through the narration what the idiotic message of the film is. All is well than ending up dumb. <br /> <br /> I've never been able to figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck came to be a protagonist in the golden age of Hollywood; Is that nose so beautiful? So photogenic ?? The film is mercifully short, lasting just over an hour. It's as if the director feels like he's messing up, so he thought it best to keep the crap.
