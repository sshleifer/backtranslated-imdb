When I was in the movie store the other day, I went through Blonde and Blonder, but something about it looked like it could be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people criticized Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder could have been just another secret treasure that was passed. But when I started to watch: executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew there was something scary. Not only that, but both of which were considered the pinnacle of sensuality: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them but they were not aging well and they are playing roles that I think were more geared towards women who are should being in their 20s, not their 40s. The story was just plain bad and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are their stupid blondes stupid, they really do not have a clue when it comes to what's going on in the world, it's really sad. But when the girls are somehow confused with murderous killers, the cops are in their story and are really calling the girls' geniuses out of their attitudes of "ignorance is bliss." They are prepared to make a "hit" on a guy, and they think they will "show him a good time", but the real killer is crazy and wants the affair and kill the girls. <BR> Denise and Pam just look very clumsy on the screen and almost as if they had read the script the day before. I know this should be stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it was unpleasant and unnecessary. Would I recommend this? Not in a million years, girls are currently trying to maintain their status as "sex kittens", it's more a sign of despair and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
