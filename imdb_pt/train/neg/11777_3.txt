Years ago I saw The Godfather and this left a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the performance memorable and the plot a classic. Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked forward to Part 2 ... I was so glad to realize at the beginning of Part 2 that here was a good accompaniment to the great Godfather movie, everything was again almost perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG !, I wish I had stopped in II. The plot was not good, it seemed to me a story made just to have a story, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's protégé was a weak character who would have been eaten alive in Padrinho 1 or 2. So scenes like, Corleone being invested with all the traps of the Catholic Church with full chorus, the murderer on horseback moving away at sunset, the invisible helicopter gunsling from the meeting (where the 'treats' escape and everyone is shot), daughter and first cousin rolling pieces of pasta through a board, the pathetic shot on the steps ..... Corleone filling sweets with he orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and cunning is not ready for an emergency?) ... NO, it was not good and with the best will in the world I will not be able to watch again. But I will watch 1 and 2 many times over the years.
