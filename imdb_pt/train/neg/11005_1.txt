This film shows a line of sketches, which partially pass to each other. I realized the passage later in the movie, at first it only irritated me. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in this movie appear without any recognizable line of expression and simply try to wriggle around that fact, using nonsense and obscenity. The attempt to get comedy without any funny piece fails. <br /> <br /> My personal and maybe subjective result after watching this movie (My God, it hurts in my head every time I call "movie"): A bold attempt to turn anything into something big. But it failed. At least the director did something out of nothing. But it is not good. <br /> <br /> Many movies are not as funny as planned, but this is the best of them all. It is the real-life manifestation of the worst-case scenario in the cinema. No. To correct me, it's even worse than that. A movie with such bad jokes, they are not funny at all. It is not even fun to watch the protagonist, writer and director (all three in the same way) perish by drowning in the sea of ​​bad movies. The movie is too bad for that.
