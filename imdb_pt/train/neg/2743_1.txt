I have to admit that I did not finish this movie because it was incredibly stupid and not worth watching. I watched him with a room full of children, who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude mood. The director, Bob Dolman, seems so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that he overrides the actual story with which I grew up. This is not a good movie for kids! In addition to the fact that the content is so gross, the movie is simply stupid, has bad stream and has no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then do not waste your time watching such a bad movie that makes you angry. Buy your children's book instead.
