I think that's just about all I need to say. I feel compelled to explain my actions though. Basically, I've never seen such armor production, and I mean that in every sense of the word. Although physical camera work, boom MIC operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable, unfortunately they are not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of the classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts of great characterization and plot, this unfortunately has a horrible script, a horrible performance and, worst of all, terribly unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> It's a crime that for every independent film you receive, distribution like the Haiku Tunnel, there are another 101 independent films that died in silence. I do not know who the Kornbluth brothers are at Sony, but this may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production came to be distributed. I'm pretty confused as to why they chose this. <br /> <br /> The ONLY part of this movie that contains any intrigue is the title. However, the reason for this is even a disappointment. I hope this review spares some people who might be intrigued by the title of this movie from watching it. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, and I forgive a lot when I'm at the movies, but that was too much. I will never forget 'tunnel', for making an important point in my life experience of the cinema. Shame is such a low point.
