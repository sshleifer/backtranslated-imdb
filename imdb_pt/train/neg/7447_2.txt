I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical novel set in the 1600s, when the West was several days away from London and law and order were much more difficult to apply. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The acting and production values ​​are good, but the way the story was mistaken was terrible. Why do television adaptations do this? Why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would like them to change the story? One of the great mysteries of life !!! The BBC made an excellent version that was televised on Christmas in the early 90's, and I'm still trying to find a copy! Follow my advice, read the book and do not bother with this insignificant version!
