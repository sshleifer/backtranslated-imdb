R O B O J O X. <br /> <br /> Burn the master. <br /> <br /> Grotesquely horrible. endless; without closing. <br /> <br /> Completely and absolutely the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replaces "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> I hate this completely outdated, unedited, unorganized, unguided, unmanaged mess of a thing called "Robot Jox" - and I just found out - THEY DID A SECOND ONE!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar, Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their films. This mess makes these movies bad - not terrible, horrible, and grotesque like this thing. This is the only movie I've ever heard of - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10 out of 10 people found this review helpful.
