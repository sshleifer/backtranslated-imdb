A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and is transformed into Snowy the Snowman's evil twin. Then go on a kill. Interesting plot. Sounds scary. And this is scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it's kinda cheesy. I saw it on the cable and I'm glad I did not pay to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low budget movie that can become a cult movie. I'm sure you have a loyal fan base somewhere. I'm not just into it. Although I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes that I found amusing. Such as the bath scene and the post-explosion scene with Picasso's reference. It was also fun to watch the many ways heroes try to kill Jack and he just does not seem to want to die. In summary, "Jack Frost" is a good low budget comedy for B movies, but a bad horror for low budget B movies.
