I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering and being killed. The extent of character development was giving each character a name and occupation, and that's about it. There was no real plot, and neither character seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes only started on their own, coming out of nowhere with a techno track. While watching this movie, I kept asking, "Where is this happening? What is happening?" The acting was the quality of the drama of high school, with hard wooden delivery, as if the actors were reading letters of tips without understanding their lines. The problem of delivering the lines became even more obvious due to the horrible sound design. The ADR appeared to have been recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly being careful to reach their marks, appearing almost robotic in their movements. So these indifferent automata are driven by a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there. This was happening, now this is happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching. Definitely not worth the nine dollars though.
