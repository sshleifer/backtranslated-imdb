This movie is horrible. Scenes of decent fight or not, the acting is really bad, as you can tell they are reading your lines a card. With painful line delivery by everyone in the cast. Think of watching a college play and shrink with the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions (strange pauses between the character's different lines, combined with a hasty delivery of line by others). If the movie was an action, this could be forgivable, but much of the film includes the plot setting and the Family Guy style, irreverent and cutting (Oh, wow, they're badly made). I'm guessing they were trying to be funny with these but again came off as a group of high school / college students having fun in the afternoon trying to put together a funny clip on Youtube. <br /> <br /> Now for the fight scenes. They are not so bad considering the level of quality seen anywhere else in the movie. Nothing great, certainly, nor anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated (Nothing like Master Drunken). The fights have an overly staged sensation, with MANY cuts at different angles with blatantly different positions from those involved. <br /> <br /> In short, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the friends of the guy involved with this very, very cheap production. What face can you ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced, and stared at this school masterpiece.
