I rented this movie from the library (hard to find for good reason) purely out of curiosity. I'm a big fan of Plath and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is horrible, not because it strays from the original text, but because it strays without focus or intent. The scenes are poorly constructed and do not take the viewer anywhere. What about the false voice of Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with the Greenwood situation; Plath's poetry was completely misused. Marilyn Hassett is completely unbelievable as Esther Greenwood (or any 20 year old), partly due to the cast (she was 32 years old during filming, the age that Plath was when she died) and partly due to her not being able to act . Hassett is all emotion, no craft, no skill. The direction is mediocre; the director simply covers what's there, which is not much. The only reason I'm giving the movie to 1 is because 0 is not an option. Sorry Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone to adapt your good work into something more appropriate.
