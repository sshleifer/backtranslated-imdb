The plot was very straightforward and easy to follow and contained lots of direct comedy to a point where it was just annoying. Some of the audience seemed to find it funny, but I like a smarter mood. <br /> <br /> There were several Swedish actors known in the film and their performance was decent considering the script. Lena Endre was beautiful as ever. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original movie, so I can not tell if it's better or worse. <br /> <br /> If you like movies like SÃ¤llskapsresan this movie might be worth a look.
