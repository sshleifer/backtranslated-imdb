As a conclusion to Hammer, I was dreading the moment when I would have to get up the courage to watch this movie and the next, Holiday on the Buses. I had seen One the Buses, the movie, and found one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was filled with all the horrible comedy that hit the screens of British TV around the early 70's. I'm ashamed to say that there were actually parts of that movie that I laughed at. I do not know if it was because I was now familiar with the characters and enjoyed some of the situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey particularly funny, though I could swear that at no point in the trilogy did he say his catchphrase, "I'll get Butler." Having watched Holiday on the Buses the jokes were starting to wear out and these three films could be compared to a Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, in which the second film made is the best (although this is probably the only way to compare). <br /> <br /> Only the people who would like to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series, who will no doubt like this, and Hammer's completists like me. For the finalists, I would say that this movie is not so bad and I can certainly think of Hammer's worst comedies.
