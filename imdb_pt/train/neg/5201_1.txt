The story is seen before, but it does not matter if you can make an appropriate storyboard. Of course the director did not spend his time on the storyboard. In parallel, the cameraman spent a lot of time tilting angles that do not match the message of the film. The funniest thing is, however, if you take a look at the movie site, you can read that it was on purpose that the director chose to make the film with bad camera angles. Because it reminds us of the hunt. But I've never heard of hunting with bad camera angles ;-) It will take 1 star because the story is good. It's a shame that Ti West has not spent more time reviewing his story. It's as if the movie was more important than the planning. Because you have a camera does not mean you should make a movie right away ... come on. Everyone can make a movie, but not everyone will be so good. So a word of advice for Ti West is: stop and label what you want. Use your time to start planning and not shooting until everything is on a storyboard. You certainly have the capacity and the desire - so do not abuse your talent.
