Since many horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters do something stupid at some stage during the process, the girls in this movie collect Gold, Silver and Bronze at an Olympic ceremony at the Darwin Awards. A mentally handicapped baboon would have made better choices than them, and would have shouted much less in doing so. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a grainy image, deliberately amateur camera work (my 92 year old grandma so far wields a camcorder with better results), extremely poor sound and no perceptible plot / narrative, so this is your ideal movie. Also note that you should take advantage of the following: women shouting for no reason, women whining for no reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this film. For example: "we have to find Stephanie" "yeah I can not believe I was talking to her, like, last night" "did she call you last night?" "Yes, she wanted to talk about a date she asked for." "What? How did she not tell me?" As in, our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and a series of terrible weapons, but I have a problem with the fact that she did not tell me she was going on a date. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the budget is down. That does not mean you have to make it seem like it costs half the budget. The score is interesting since everyone - except for one - was written and executed by the writers / directors of the film itself. In fact, it seems like the whole budget was blown up in a track by The Duskfall, a death metal band from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about the whole movie is the ending that leaves us with the possibility of a sequel.
