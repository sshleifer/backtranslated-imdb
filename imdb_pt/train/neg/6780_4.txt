This film was a critical and box office fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that later became a play - which failed on Broadway. The story is about some navy officers on leave in San Francisco during World War II. They have 4 days of leave that they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The movie snakes a lot and none of the characters look too real. Cary Grant is usually brilliant in comedy and drama - but here he does some sort of wheeled dealer and he does not really do that. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn was initially set to play alongside Grant, but had other commitments - so Suzy Parker came on the scene. She had never acted before, but it was the best photographic model of the United States at the time. I think she did a good job considering all the pressure she was suffering. Grant's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in some brief scenes - really did not work. The studio was trying to give her some class, acting with Grant - but the character had no substance at all.
