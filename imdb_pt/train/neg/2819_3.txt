The Marquis of Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a double role, free sex and nudity, murders and chaos ... on paper Tobe Hopper's night terror seems to be at least a fun and entertaining film given the Ingredients . It is not. It's a less incoherent conspiracy that brings little entertainment. There is basically no plot other than a few vague things about a cult that follows the work of De Sade, who for some reason does not clearly feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. This is very beautiful, I think it has something to do with the Gnostics, but who knows what the writers were thinking. Most of the film is a sinuous mess as the heroine is exposed to various oddities, dream sequences and erotic encounters, interspersed with Englund scenes as prisoner De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery. It seems that the manufacturers were trying something serious, but whatever their pretensions, they are buried in tackiness, poor performance, scandal and the pretense of decapitated heads. <br /> <br /> There are not many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always, and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, though not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of nudity during the film, but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see the movie where the guide "When you're as criminal as I came" from the Australian guide to movie certification ratings was in front of so many VHS tapes of the nineties.
