This sleek and sexy movie is a must-see. Only with multiple views can we truly understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally I like the narrator for his clever, no matter left untouched, narration style. The introduction catches you immediately and holds you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. It provides a wonderful insight into the training world and allows the audience to really connect with the inner horror that this movie exhibits. The screenplay keeps the movie wonderfully well. Not only for children, but the older ones will also gain a greater understanding of the trainable and the modern understanding they have about sexual experience. Before its time and innovative in cinematography, it certainly defines the word "masterpiece".
