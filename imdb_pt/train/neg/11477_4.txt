Sorry for my neighbors in Nevada, but this one is bad. <br /> <br /> Brian must have had a lot of botox because he had very few facial expressions throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Alice looked like she had a plaque tied in the back. She was tough all through the movie. <br /> <br /> I looked at Alice and Brian and was amazed to see the extensive work of art. I would have guessed they were first year students. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason took the film frankly with their jokes and ease with each line. Ed certainly has not lost his charisma. I wish I had time to meet him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I love the snow scenes and scenes of the shops and church because I've been there. I do Nevada City my home and was eagerly awaiting the premiere. I was sadly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
