Sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to enjoy the good ones. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This will always be in the bad movie category, simply because everyone except Shu Qi's performance was terrible. Martial Angel tells about Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief who turned right after leaving his lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years earlier. But her past returns to haunt her while Chi Lam is kidnapped by the rescue company's security software Cat. In order to rescue him, she calls her old friends from her orphanage days, six other grumpy women, to save the day ... <br /> <br /> I may have said the corny synopsis, but that's a tacky story. In fact, the whole script and direction had no quality. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and associated with a plot that was as thin as rice paper in the water. If I could summarize, make a bad movie of Jackie Chan, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw away the budget, and you get Martial Angels: a formula job without any imagination. <br /> <br /> Mind you, I have to give credit when credit is due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person to leave unscathed from the terrible action, as was her performance that shone. Okay, you can not say she was excellent - after all she had absolutely nothing to work on - but she managed to get some character out of her role. Moreover, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made any other impression - though these were mostly glimpses and very brief. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the movie fell apart. Scenes and dialogues were completely unnatural and unbelievable, special effects were obviously made at low cost with no attempt to wipe edges between people and the blue screen mask poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes, elemental and unfavorable camera angles. and direction I've ever seen better than a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was too much of an issue for cooks. Most likely, the budget was shaken by too much enthusiasm for having seven babies on the same silver screen. That did not leave much else. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the way this movie was made was like a cheap porn movie without porn. Charlie's angels, it's not. In fact, while the sisters can do this on their own, none of this was actually so apparent here. <br /> <br /> Definitely forget.
