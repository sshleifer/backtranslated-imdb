My comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which I find quite offensive, since I am making an effort to judge this film for other people. Please be tolerant of other people's opinions. Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsche's works is not understood, so I will completely change my comment. <br /> <br /> I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons. Subject: One must be very careful when making a film about a philosopher who is still not understood by the masses and between the peers, brings passionate discussions. One thing philosophers agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a film about your life, which obviously includes your "ideas", is something that you should be extremely careful about or do not do anything about. Wisdom begins with what you do not know. One might think that this is not a review of the film itself, but the film is not about an imaginary character, it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had great influence in the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen subject, the tomato. There is a responsibility to producers when they make a movie about real facts. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken. <br /> <br /> Script: One of the first things I noticed was the ridiculous accents. Because? It distracts what it should be; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It does not help to put things in a correct geographical perspective or in time! Come on, make English right or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson got the right part ... letting his characters speak a grumpy Aramaic in passion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is very exaggerated. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor to represent Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the facts are far away. <br /> <br /> And so on. It's a waste of celluloid.
