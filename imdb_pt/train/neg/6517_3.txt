I went to a screening of this movie and although I had some moments that made me laugh, I had some very important flaws. First of all, it features to be the humorous exploits of a real-life divorcee trying to find love in Los Angeles. What transpires is a depressing, narcissistic and bland joke through the filmmaker's love life and professional life story. Jokes wear out quickly and you suddenly see yourself without caring about this man's progress. The ridiculous thing is that the director simultaneously presents himself as an extremely annoying and highly flawed character, and then expects us to worry.
