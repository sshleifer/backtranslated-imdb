This version is pretty insipid, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt's acting style is completely inadequate for the daring passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored and petulant teenager whose dental appliances hurt! I also can not believe they eliminated the great scene of Edward's marriage proposal at the end of the book, one of the most exciting moments in the literature. I appreciate that they have finally used a woman so young and simple to play Jane, a character who is supposed to be a friend of the world, but if you want to see a version that comes closer to the personalities and passions of the novel, please see Version of the years 70 with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and beautiful to play Jane, but no one touched the Rochester character as Scott did.
