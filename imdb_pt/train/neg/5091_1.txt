My comment is for the Russian version of the Space Race called Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space) hosted on Russia's First Channel from April 10 to 13, 2006. A poor translation could have ruined some details, but I doubt that's the case. The number of factual errors is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of the first missiles). Even half the film in the US contains several errors and omissions. The public is not informed of any US V-2 / A-4 releases. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same serial number 'UE' onboard. Apollo 1 must be cast on the Moon, etc. In the Russian half, everyone is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is saboteur and traitor, Mishin is an alcoholic, etc. Men as functions; without motivation, without life. Uniform and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting release (I think this was added especially for the Russian version).
