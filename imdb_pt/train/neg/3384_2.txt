If you were to judge only on the basis of the film, the committee that gave the musical "A Chorus Line" a Pulitzer Prize, and the Broadway audience that kept the warhorse running for 15 years, were all in heavy narcotics, singular sensation This movie certainly IS NOT. <br /> <br /> What had someone to think that Richard Attenborough was the right fit for this material mystifies me completely, but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sitting on the screen like a piece of clay. Not content with the original score the way it was originally written, someone decided that the film really needed a new song to give the film a bit of security. So we are beaten with the Oscar nominee (!) "Surprise, Surprise". Well surprised, surprised, the music stinks, and so does the movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: D
