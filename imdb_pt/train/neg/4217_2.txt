This was recently in the classics of AMC's vibrant movie and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of "Journey to the Core of Earth" and "Mysterious Island." I was very disappointed not only with acting credentials, but with the silly story that goes with a five-year-old comic book. Make sure you spot the wires that are holding the wings of the Pterdactyl when they grab "Ogar," a half-idiot premodern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left open to redo the same effects in "People that Time Forgot". Do not waste your time.
