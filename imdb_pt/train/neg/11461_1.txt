Please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just do not do it. Especially if anyone is lucky to be dozing by their side. Damn cheek, if you ask me. I hoped something would happen - it never happened. I'm not one of those people to stop watching a movie in the middle of the road. I always have to see it through. What a big mistake. Do yourself a favor and go paint a wall and watch it dry - much more fun. Please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - just do not do it.
