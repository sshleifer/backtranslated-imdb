Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen; I was ready to leave after the first ten minutes. The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners. Do not get me wrong, I love stupid and stupid movies as much as the next girl, but the whole premise, writing and humor sucks. It seemed to me that they were going to a "Napoleon Dynamite" feel - strange and random scenes that would lead to a cult audience. Instead, she was forced, clumsy and strange. <br /> <br /> The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I felt totally awful that she (and Sissy Spacek) had signed up for this horrible thing. <BR> Thank you, I did not pay for it.
