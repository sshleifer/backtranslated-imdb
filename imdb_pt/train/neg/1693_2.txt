My husband and I went to see this movie, being the fans of horror movies that we are. Two hours later, I found myself wanting both my money and my time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this movie basically contained the best points in the movie. There was nothing too scary about the movie, other than a good timing on surprise tickets, etc. I found that most of the "scary" parts were more comical than anything else. After seeing other films based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is considered scary in Japan is not what is scary here in the USA. My advice: If you're a fan of real horror movies, spare yourself the pain of sitting there. I really can not say that I would recommend renting this, unless you have a free rental coming to you.
