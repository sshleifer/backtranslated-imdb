I visited one of my relatives a while back, and we showed up at a theater, so we thought we'd go in and bid on this movie. What a mistake! This movie is horrible in every department. I had never heard of the movie before, and literally everyone still did not hear it. No wonder, this is as important as possible. It's a comedy, so it says, well, the only funny thing is the director's ability, or lack thereof, to make such a movie. Coming so close to Christmas, this should be titled how to cook a turkey in less than an hour and a half - or the time that passed while I was leaving. At the end of the movie, you will feel like you have been poisoned by food in a sick turkey, and you regret having wasted your time with that dribble. Who knows why such things are done? Some people left the theater before the movie ended and I blame myself for not leaving much earlier. This really pisses me off that you pay good money to see something decent, and all you go out and see is a poor TV movie that should be shown at 2 o'clock in the morning, it's actually so bad, TV day is not should be showing it. What more can you say ... probably not enough swearing could do it justice.
