A lot of other reviewers here, including many whose opinions I respect, keep this slice of European horror sleaze in high regard. Personally, I did not like any of it. It is an incoherent attempt of an atmospheric period between sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best makes these kinds of movies very well. Unfortunately, the infamous exploitation filmmaker Joe D'Amato does not. D'Amato's best known films are famous for their high thickness quotient. This, one of his first films, does not have the constant disgusting scenes that his most notorious "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the Darkness" did. Ultimately, it's an incoherent movie that fails to engage the viewer in any way. Without the sleaze factor, it becomes very annoying. As I said, others liked this movie, but I thought it was a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are some advantages to the film. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is in it, and she looks really hot and is often naked. However, the cult movie icon Klaus Kinski is completely wasted on a subplot without connection to the main movie. He seems bored with the role and does not have the manic intensity that he does at his best. The score is legal and there are some brief moments of unintentional violence. Still, this is a pretentious and nonsensical movie that manages to be incredibly annoying. (3/10)
