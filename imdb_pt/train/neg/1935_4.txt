Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely superfluous sequence of two excellent fantasy films. The film offers the special effects of spells that can be expected, but fails painfully on all other fronts. All actors play extremely silly caricatures. You still have to be in diapers to find your joking humor even remotely funny. The plot is predictable and development is sometimes erratic and often slow. In the end, the movie begins to resemble old Godzilla movies, including sleazy special effects and a (well, still another) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I had smiled if I was waiting for the camp. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see what fancy jungle fans have to put up with - in this case, because someone thought they could extract some extra money from a camp. formula of success. They will not be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead like a dodo.
