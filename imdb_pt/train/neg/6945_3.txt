Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has his son killed and his wife violently attacked in a home invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help you through post-traumatic stress. Then Archer is confronted with a man (Til Schweiger) tied and gagged in a chair. He is told that this is the man who killed his son and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he wants with him. And there are a variety of instruments there to help you ... <br /> <br /> The film is interesting at first (and shows real restraint in terms of blood and blood), but it gets stupid by the minute and has some highly unlikely. twists and turns. It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked that anyone really thought of using it any more. As talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer got involved in such a crap as this one is beyond me. This gets three stars for acting, but the stupid plot and really unbelievable twists make it a difficult task.
