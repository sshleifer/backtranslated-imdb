Maybe it's not my genre, but the plot was horrible as was the performance of Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in the role of being seduced here (while in marijuana? Why did this need to be included? This plot weakened considerably). Also the character of Farentino. It would have been better if she had had more respect for a relationship. Would the movie try to say? not much.
