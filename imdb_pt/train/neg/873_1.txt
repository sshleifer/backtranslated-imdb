An executive, very successful in his professional life, but very incapable in his family life, meets a boy with Down syndrome, escaped from a residence. Both characters feel very alone, and the apparently less intelligent one will show the executive the beauty of the little things in life ... With this argument, the Amelie-like atmosphere and the sentimental music, I did not expect a morbid, repulsive movie. Finally, as there were some interesting scenes (the boy sometimes is a pretty violent guy), and the interpretation of the two actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue watching the film. French cinema, in general, has the ability to show something that looks very much like life, as opposed to the more stereotypical American cinema. But because of this, it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd end, with the impossible death of the boy, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive's family, the cheap morality, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the face Waving from the sky like Michael Landon ... Really nasty, in my humble opinion.
