It's hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, that we end up with this piece of cinematic junk. The original was a dark and high-impact thriller that achieved cult status, demonstrating the art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This movie adds nothing, does not deliver anything, and finally ends up in the big box of failed sequels. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a pretty talented and capable cast. Unfortunately we're treated to a 90-minute dissertation on Catherine Tramell's self-indulgent life ... or it's Sharon Stone. Possibly a copulation of both. <br /> <br /> If the desire is also to see a continuation of the sensual provocation of sex as in "B.S.1", forget. You end the tedium of soft pornography that ultimately supports the old saying that a woman can be more seductive in clothes than out of them. It is interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was playing with her skivvies, through the 1966 GEORGY GIRL, when Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and quite capable of staying right here. <br /> <br /> If you are a true movie fan then you should see this movie and judge it using your own rating system. If not, you can expect the release of the DVD in the "rated", "unrated", "colectors" edition, or "ultimate" version, and maybe in another 14 years we will be saturated with the news of "Basic" Instinct 3 "height in which Mrs. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody will care.
