This is possibly the worst Christmas movie of all time. The plot is virtually nonexistent, the acting (Affleck in particular) is poor at best. Fans of Ben Affleck are likely to defend this movie, but deep down they must agree. As much as I could muster the plot consisted of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman, is told by a psychiatrist to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget about his childhood. In doing so, he ends up paying the family who currently lives in the house to be his family at Christmas ... and that's it. The film continues and eventually he meets with the daughter of the family .... blah blah blah.
