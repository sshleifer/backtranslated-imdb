I could not believe it when I put this movie on my DVD player. I thought about giving a good laugh, since I played D & D for half of my life. I had to turn it off as I had company and they were wondering what the crap I was watching. <br /> <br /> It ended later, and I should have left it in the soft-core gay clown porn at the beginning. No, they convey fart jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as KKK ... This movie is pretty common for anyone who has ever played D & D. <br /> <br /> No wonder it looks like Real D & D did not allow them to use the game. Who would have wanted their names linked to that?
