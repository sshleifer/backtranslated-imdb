This movie is truly brilliant. It shies away from banality to behave at such speed that you do not even see common sense and decency for humankind to whiz by. But that does not stop there! This film reaches the bottom of the barrel so hard that it returns to the ridiculous comedy spot: see how Kor, the aspiring Bean-conted Conan with plenty of hairs on his neck, shakes his sword swinging his sword like there's no tomorrow (and the way like him Actually, I was amazed that there was a tomorrow for him, or at least for his beer gut. Do not miss this movie, it's a fantastic joke through idiocy and sheer mentality! And once you've finished watching this one, wipe the tears of joy (or tears of frustration in an attempt so inept to tell stories) from your eyes, because some idiot gave these people another $ 5 to make a continuation!
