This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say I've never seen a movie worse than this !!! <br /> <br /> And I NEVER WORRY !!!! <br /> <br /> I'm a huge fan of "B" horror movies. As you can imagine ... I've been exposed to some of the worst that the film industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> I was drawn to this movie by its title. I mean, come on ... what true horror fan would not be intrigued by a title like "Vampires vs. Zombies" ??? Images of the "undead" struggling with each other with "non-life" danced in my head. I thought to myself ... "this I have to see" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well ... sorry to say ... "this I wish I had not seen" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very misleading to say the least. There were no vampires fighting zombies. In fact, there is no plot !!!! If you asked me about what this movie is, I can honestly say that I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie absolutely does not make any sense !!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of this disaster ... I felt sorry for the poor souls who had invested money for this project, for they certainly have no commercial sense !!!
