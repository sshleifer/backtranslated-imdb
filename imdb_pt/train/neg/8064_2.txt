... I watched it in my teens. This movie was slightly entertaining. What I liked about Soul Survivors was the Gothic atmosphere during the party scenes, and the constant swings between 'dream' and 'reality'. <br /> <br /> If there were no movies like 'The 6th Sense' and 'Don' Look Now 'I would be surprised by the ending.
