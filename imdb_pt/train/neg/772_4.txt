This movie is not as good as all the Christ movies I've ever seen. And I am quite surprised that in this story Pilate wants to end with Jesus when the Scriptures (as well as the other films) say differently. There is also a very important question: the resurrection. None of the other films skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians is in this same event. As Paul says in one of his letters: "If Christ has not risen from the dead, our faith is vain." One very striking scene for me in this movie was seeing the remains of the palm trees that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus was NOT a myth. And, in fact, he was also a Jew. There are many documents (religious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or, I must say, God became a man) that has indeed changed mankind. I strongly advise him (as he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator on the 1st. Century.
