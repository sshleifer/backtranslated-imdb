1 st watched 3/8/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about meat-eating zombies in a three-story film chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating parts of human flesh in 3D !! Wow, not !! This has been done repeatedly in 2D in a zombie movie, but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story, not the real eating meat. That's what made the original classics of zombies good. The meat consumption has just been added as an extra. In fact, we are bored during most of this 3 part chronicle because of the end of the lame movie (as in the twilight zone) easily understood and peacefully revealed. The last story is actually the story with which the film started (having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we can also see flesh eating zombies in that scene. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this banquet in 3D.
