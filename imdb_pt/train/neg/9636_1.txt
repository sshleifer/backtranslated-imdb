This astonishing waste of production money is the film's proof that the rich and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. One-piece (silly) from Tennessee Williams and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular mountain mansion on top of the cliff in the Mediterranean must have looked like a fire a winner when presented to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. Visually, the movie is spectacular, but this is the force of nature that allowed the definition and the fact that a real house is used instead of a set. Taylor's strident antics, Burton's half-asleep wanderings, wacky dialogue, laughing Noel Coward, ridiculous story and plot devices and absurd costume simply annoys the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money, talent, and clear evidence that famous and famous people can be idiots like the rest of the people on the planet. Not even fun. Just terrible and crazy shocking waste.
