The only reason I remember this movie is because it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 years old and my friend was 18 years old. We were the age when action movies were what we liked the most (ok, second more). We left feeling so insulted, wanted our money back, but the time could never be recovered. <br /> <br /> The issue is what killed this movie. As the truck is attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the film completely insults the intelligence of the public by having these rogue villains in 4x4 VW Bugs firing rockets at the truck. Please rocket into a truck known for carrying PU? The worst thing is that these VWs can take 15 to 18 shots from a four-rocket launcher. You would see in VW with 4 rockets firing 2 of them, would cut the truck with the last coupled, would return a second later with two rockets coupled, would shoot another, then it would go in front of the truck and now it is back to a complete set of 4 rockets . <br /> <br /> We resist waiting for a grand finale that never happened. It looks like they ran out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
