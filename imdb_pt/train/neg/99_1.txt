Some of the films you choose for a kilogram are pretty good - 23rd century movies have cast dozens of obscure Italian and American films that were great, but although Hardgore has released some Fulci films among others, most of his production sucks such as Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it's not as annoying as the Fedor de Carne. Other than that, it's a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built by a conch. <br /> <br /> It's been noticed elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie that inserts previews of the action into your credit sequence, so by the time you reach the zombie attacks, you already saw all this. <br /> <br /> Fans of bad movies will have a ball watching the 18,000 errors of continuity and the diabolical performance of the cast (especially the hitchhiker, who was so bad he made me laugh a little), and congratulations to Hardgore for getting into the spirit of things, casting such a bad impression that it looked like I was watching a homemade video of a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Horrible and horrible things. We all did stuff like that when we got a camera, but common sense prevails and those movies languish in our closets somewhere. Avoid.
