I'm not surprised even the cowgirls catch the blues if this movie is something to go by. I expected something better from Uma Thurman, which was the reason I went through that experience in the first place. A horrible movie with only music as a redeeming quality. It's a shame that we are unable to give 0 out of 10 on these assessments. This movie deserves this.
