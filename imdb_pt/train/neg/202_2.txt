This is not the sound of the bees, this is the effect induced when watching this extremely long, extremely annoying and misinterpreted film. As I have done this for all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep I will never know. The plot is simple ... 3 completely nasty idiots talk about sex for 3 and a half hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly. That's even worse, if that's possible. I really should be a masochist if I could watch this whole movie without turning it off ... or killing someone.
