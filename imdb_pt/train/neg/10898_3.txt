If you like to comment on movies where the script comes in the middle of the movie, that's the only one. A scene and acting like in a porn movie, but nothing is happening just some groping and playing the third kind. Which actually becomes very annoying after 45 minutes of contact but no action. Some of the actors that I saw in actual x rated movies and there their acting then was much better. All special effects are made by the great "Rondo", which performs all the magic in your mind. A cult movie is written on the box. Does this mean that this movie will not be watched? <br /> <br /> Get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on New Year's Day.
