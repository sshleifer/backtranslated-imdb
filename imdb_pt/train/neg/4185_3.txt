I give this movie a 3 as it is worse than the cult films that deserve a good 2. Does not it make sense to you? Well, that does not have to. This is another vampire movie with a stupid plot, no, let me rephrase, incredibly stupid plot, where space cowboys (complete with cowboy hats) fight against a space race of idiot vampires. <br /> <br /> Does it get uglier? What is this? The only good thing about this movie was Natassia Malthe, with her stunning Norwegian beauty. God, I wish Michael Ironside and the DeLuise brothers would stop accepting idiotic roles in idiotic movies! I mean, at least SeaQuest was cool! I know Mr. Ironside from many movies, he played in 164 movies on that date !! It is true that he was rarely in an important role, but still!
