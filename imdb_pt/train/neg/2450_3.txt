I watched Peter Jackson's version of The Lord of the Rings when I was reading the Two Towers and thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At this point the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released. in DvD, but I told myself that I would finish reading The Two Towers and The Return of Kings before I watched it (as I thought it would show the whole trilogy). <br /> <br /> So when I finished the trilogy, I went and brought the DvD, which was a stupid idea, because it was absolutely bullshit. <br /> <br /> I was really bored 20 minutes, which was very strange because I love the book and I have to say that the creator of this movie could even think of fitting at least 1 and half of the books into a film of 2 hours and 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> None of the characters had emotions when they were talking and they seemed to read it from a page, even my favorite character that is Gandalf did not look anything interesting. <br /> <br /> The animation was the only good in parts of the movie except for the orks (they looked horrible) and Aragorn and Sam face it. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this movie was released because there was not even an appropriate end, but maybe it was good that the manufacturer ran out of money because the film could not get any better. <br /> <br /> I hope no one will judge the books in this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
