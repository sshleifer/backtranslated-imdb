This movie goes from 4th to 1st without worrying about the 3rd or 2nd, grinding the way to the finish line b-movie. The blow in the beginning is easily the best and most intelligent part of the film. This is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the tub takes place so fast you may miss her. Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro for this bad mess to mediocre. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this supposed marginal society are holy - especially the unbelievable character Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
