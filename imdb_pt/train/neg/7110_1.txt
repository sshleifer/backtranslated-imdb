Well, you have to give the director credit for how brave he was. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total cast of five people (no extras at ALL), but he also decided to use below-average special effects with a messy and annoying plot, so did he, and I'm not joking, I put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you can die of fear !!! However, they promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. Having a lame and scary gardener is always a good move. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you watch Mystery Science Theater 3000, you should have seen it already. They like to show horrible movies, just so you know. <br /> <br /> A good gift for someone you hate.
