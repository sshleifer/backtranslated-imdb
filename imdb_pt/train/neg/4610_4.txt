I watched this movie because I noticed that Kari Wuhrer was in the cast. I've long had a theory about her, that she's a talented actress, but she never seems to be able to prove it, because she's always in this kind of low budget B movie. She's still beautiful, and she's still trying to act on the unfortunate stuff I always see. This is no different. The movie is often ugly and disturbing, but that's no good. George Wendt played against the guy, and it was so shocking that he was recognized for his role. Another note about Ms. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I last saw her. Perhaps reduction surgery, or (most likely) removal of implants. This is not a bad thing. She still looks great. I'd like to see her in a better movie.
