Spoilers ahead if you want to call them like that ... <br /> <br /> I would almost recommend this movie so people could actually see a 1/10. Where to start, let's start from the top ... <br /> <br /> THE HISTORY: Do not believe the premise - the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people who understand what the mysterious events are . It is a basic draub, go to the movies of hut without intensity or "effort". <br /> <br /> THE SCRIPT: I usually give credit to independent writers, it's hard work when you're just getting started ... but that sucks. The story is flat - leaves you emotionless throughout the movie. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of "Woah, you totally scared me" and "I was wondering if you uh ... if you would like ... uh, you would come to the cabin with me". It makes me want to yank all my hair, one string at a time, and feed it to myself. <br /> <br /> THE CHARACTERS: HOLY CRAP !!!! Some have described the characters as plans, I want to go one step further and say that they actually have an inverted arc of characters. They really begin to work in a parallel universe and they almost begin to act backwards ... <br /> <br /> THE ACTORS: Worse than the characters are the actors. They already get poor written characters and add dramatic acting in high school. The "Woah you totally scared me" was said so monotonous and slow - as if it were idiot. I could complain for hours only with the actors. <br /> <br /> TECHNIQUE: ILLUMINATION: An eight-year-old would be disappointed with the lighting of this film. Too bleak in the areas, too bleached in the others. The director should not use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene correctly. Baby steps! SOUND: How many sound faces are needed to make a real movie? 9. With so many sounds, this should sound incredible, but the exact opposite happened. There is a particular scene that really stands out, these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes at every camera angle .... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn how to use it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm running out of space. Rent it - I challenge you ... Rent and learn from it ... give it a rating of 1..it deserves it. <br /> <br /> Leaving ...
