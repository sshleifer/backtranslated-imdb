After reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth, I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say I was a bit disappointed. The story was difficult to follow because the film is defined as a series of flashbacks between the present and the recent past that are very poorly executed. The characters, despite the best efforts of the actors, are flat and uninteresting. Sex is and nudity is more explicit than it needs to be. I've never seen a movie where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions for a plot that was not explained well to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.
