To be honest at the time I first heard this show, I think it might be a bad idea to do a program that would make Muslims use racial jokes in themselves, but it's the exact opposite. I realized that the program doing this can help people understand that if a Muslim uses a word like that in real life, that does not mean it's a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they play with their stereotype, observing the program, ordinary people will realize that although there may be bad Muslims, this does not mean that we are all bad, we just try to live 1 day a day, how difficult it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like "Blow up" or Yaser saying that we would end the competition, and people took the wrong way. Being a Muslim I know things like this usually do not happen, but they do happen and a lot of people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, it's not true that things are not like that. people will see how we are mistreated by watching this program and this can make them think about how to act. I'm glad a show like this has popped up. There are many shows that Pyotr Muslim people like terrorists, many people find funny for my opioion is OK do it now and then because much prety everything is made of fun of who we are to say that you can not make fun of that is unfair, but this is done often and really gives the people of Muslin a bad name.
