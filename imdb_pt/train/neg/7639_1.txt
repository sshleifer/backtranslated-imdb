I saw this movie at NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and I thought it was very bad. The first and most disturbing was the way it was filmed; that is, a lot of slow-motion and overly artistic close-ups that seemed to have no meaning - history or aesthetics - as well as showing the skills of the director of photography (which I believe was also the director). This movie looked like what a pretentious film student would create. The lead actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very cute, but he was a mediocre actor at best; and the rest of the cast went from bad to bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. I have to admit that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the movie; laughing and sighing constantly, but I did not like it very much.
