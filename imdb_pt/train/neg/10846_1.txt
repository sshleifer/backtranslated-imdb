Not since Caligula I considered turning off the movie in half ... but then with this, I had only 15 minutes when I considered it. Unfortunately, I did it all the way. Make sure you do not. <br /> <br /> It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking, bloody, scary, scary or sexual. It is not one of these things, but desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's boring, banal, ordinary, predictable, and exceptionally poorly executed (videotaped, high school special effects, no sense of basic visual narrative, almost inaudible dialogue ... not worth listening to though) . /> <br /> This film is proof for the argument that even direct video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
