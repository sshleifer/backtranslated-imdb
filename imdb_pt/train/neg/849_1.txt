A star. That's all this documentary deserves. I did not feel so disappointed in watching a movie, let alone a documentary, for some time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel. Marvin spin-offs, for all his fun yet informative informative cheerful. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. Having seen all the other documents in the series, I realized that I need to see this too, especially after seeing relatively good reviews elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Well, for those of you who put a good review of this doc ... what were you thinking?! lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they managed to convey was interesting, the presentation failed in every way possible. He had a terrible flow, was incredibly unfocused in what he was trying to say (with shuffled and sometimes out of place information), horrible effects (which included the few moments of CGI and especially the effects of makeup) and overuse of the MTV style Effects camera settings. Speaking of makeup effects, one critic here mentioned how laughable the scene was when cave men came upon a giant monkey and how much it looks like a 1970s horror movie. . Well, there are plenty of moments as if people portrayed the monkeys' men looking ridiculous and acting ridiculously. None of this is aided by horrible camera positions and compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all is that none of this is shown in an interesting or dynamic way, or it seems remotely real. Nor does he seem to have been taken seriously. Also lacking any emotional impact that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in "Walking With Dinosaurs" of the fate of Ornithochirus (sp?)? This episode still leaves me on the verge of tears every time I watch. It is this kind of involvement with the subject that is missing here above all else. When you are more involved in the subject and it is a personal story, even if it is just speculation, you are more concerned with the facts surrounding you. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of this production is good storytelling. (at least on the BBC version I saw) and the music. Otherwise, DO NOT bother even renting this, unless you want to have a good laugh (which I did often, but usually followed by rolling my eyes). This does not belong on the shelf with the other "Walking with ..." documents. <br /> <br /> And does it make sense to learn that this document was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who did the work? others in the series? Hmmm ...
