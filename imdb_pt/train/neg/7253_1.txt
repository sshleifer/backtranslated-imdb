We rented the DVD hoping for a good western. The movie was beautiful and the scenes reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why exactly did the villain kill the owner of the mine? It's not really attached to the movie except to establish how bad it was and have a hiding place. <br /> <br /> The bank employee who is going bad only acts too badly to convincingly decide to hire killers for his employers. At least let us guess. No character developed for the owners of the bank or for the bank employee. Very late in much of anything going on. Absurd premise that Martin still needed to see the judge after all. <br /> <br /> The gang confessed to killing their in-laws. Even more absurd that he confesses to try and judge will not listen to the sheriff. even more ridiculous that Martin hanged him and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him with the armed hand to finally return to his city and save his wife from the bad employee of the bank. Would not he come back just after the swift dispatch of the gang to save the woman and arrest the bad employee of the bank? Just send the judge a note that the gang confessed before being killed on the trail ???? !!! Overall, very sad acting and does not make sense for the movie.
