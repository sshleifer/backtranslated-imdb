I could not believe some of the horrible dialogues that came out of people's mouths, and the end of the recording errors attached to the body of the movie was a real joke. And we took pictures of Angelique Pettyjohn (type) and Loren Crabtree. A teleportation device activated by psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were leftovers from Klaus Kinski's film, ANDROID, which gives the film a value greater than the cheap. <br /> <br /> Inside the container is an alien dwarf (played by Ray son) who begins to grab people to death. It was very funny to see this little 'creature' in a black reptile suit with what looks like a large beetle shell, running in the dark. We even got to see the little stamp and rip a ET poster, which I found hilarious. <br /> <br /> And then there is what appears to be a snake that also comes out of the container that is hammered to death by William Fair after the mini creature chews the neck of Frank McDonald in the kitchen. A low budget assumes ALIEN, I suppose ... <br /> <br /> The whole thing ends abruptly, it seems that they ran out of film at the end before the reel of errors came in with the final credits. Talk about the lack of funding ... Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director's comment that they were also not sure if Aldo Ray would do it through the shooting and would remember his lines. He barely did it. <br /> <br /> Low-budget cheese sneezing. It's fun to watch, I'll grant you that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
