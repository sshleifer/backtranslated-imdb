I thought this was a sequel to some types, and it's to be the original from 1983. But a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it. <br /> <br /> Actually, I had very few expectations for this movie, but I lost only 95 minutes of life. Without suspense - in fact, I feel clairvoyant, with little acting and so full of technical mistakes, then I, as a computer geek, just could not believe it. They tried to make a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours. But this is not even worthy of a low-budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie, this is a complete waste of time. Instead, get the original. The theme is still valid. Do not leave too much power in a machine. And the acting and the plot are much more stimulating and exciting.
