What a fantastic premise: a movie about the Berlin Airlift. Must have it all. Tragedy. Suspense Camaraderie. Berlin rivals Frauleins and tough American riders. love and tears. What we have, is a movie without any of the above. Heino Ferch tries to get past John Wayne, but he fails miserably. He acts so hard that at any moment he should break. He tries to play the tough guy, instead of being a tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Why were they throwing stones at a lake? Why does he bring his charcoal bricks? SFX is very, very well done. Although. Do hundreds or more airplanes over Berlin, look like an attack-fighter training squadron instead of an organized air transport? as indeed it was. Curiously, the White House, the Kremlin, and the office of General Lucius D. Clays all look like one and the same dark, dusty ensemble. Notice the same curtains, hanging from the bottom of the windows, as if it were a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why are almost all the scenes dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, appears as a small, insecure and loose general, who relies on his noble idea of ​​air travel. He was quite the opposite. So you combine all these individual mistakes and the result is a film that does not generate passion, nor suspense, nor historical accuracy. Sorry, it started so promising ??
