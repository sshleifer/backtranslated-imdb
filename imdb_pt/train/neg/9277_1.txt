I saw the omen when I was 11 on tv. I liked the trilogy. So when the chance to finally see one at the movies turned around, I did not let it pass. I went to the movies knowing that what I was about to see was not a movie release but a TV movie. However, being a fan I could not resist. But this Omen movie that I saw in a midnight screening did not bring chills that brought laughter. Risible dialogue such as "it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject God". How absurd. Not decent set pieces. Faye Grant's Good in V is wasted with this hell script. No surprises and no fun. However I did laugh out loud several times in our evil was.Truly Pathetic.1 out of 10
