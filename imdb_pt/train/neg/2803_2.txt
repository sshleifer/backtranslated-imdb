Considering the limits of this film (The whole movie in a setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors in total) should have been much better done. If you have these limits in making a movie, how can lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, they were talking a little below acting in Clerks, except that it was a nice movie, it had no substance. Well, you tried, but you really fail. <br /> <br /> It makes attempts to self-refer in some parts, but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors that it was simply bad. And the main character Neal face, that pathetic loser. Clearly, 10 people made this 'movie' and everyone knew each other, and it was probably a real rock band they had, but unfortunately these people really have no idea how terrible they are all over. This was done in 2005, but they all look so naive that it smells just the pre-grunge era. <br /> <br /> Fortunately I did not pay to see this (Starz on Demand delivers again!), but it was under the title "The Possessed" is not Studio 666, no matter what you do with the title, no can help. This could have been a much better movie done - there is no excuse for this bad movie when you have the obvious limited parameters that the filmmakers had when they did it, working within those limits you should do the things you can control and the things you you can work with the best you can. Instead, they figured mediocrity would be good enough. And this music video, wow that was bad, I quickly fowarded through that. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair, if you're all over the b-movie shit I suppose you will and see this.
