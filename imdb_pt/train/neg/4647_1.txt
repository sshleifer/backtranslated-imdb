Half the reviews were good so I took a chance for $ 10. Of course Priscilla Barnes had some talk about sex but it was not much. The whole plot after she may be the other mother actress and the documentary filmmaker falling for the young woman is stretching her. Not funny is not so cheeky is not much of anything, but a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry, this is based on nothing that has ever happened in the industry. It could have shocked what is popular today in adult movies mocking today's gonzo videos and what a great orgy they had 5 minutes to film that joke a bigger orgy was made bigger and better decades ago in the early 1970s.
