I got this movie for $ 5 at a discount bookstore, Adam Sandler is a great actor and I figured it would be a good movie, well, it was not. There was absolutely no story line, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "The F-Word" all the other words he said, cursing usually did not bother me, but that was over. And even worse than the lack of plot were the parts where Sandler would start talking to the camera in random parts of the film, this reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they saw the screen and asked questions. And finally, it's when they randomly put photos of bikini girls at random moments in the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie, it's a waste of money
