Some may scoff, but in fact there is real art in making particularly bad movies. That loses all fronts. <br /> <br /> A group of youngsters - women with panting breasts and continually wet t-shirts, of course - will shoot "blood surfing" and end up becoming crocodiles of the foot. <br /> <br /> Not only was the crocodile obviously false, but some of the props seem to have come out of the thunder birds! <br /> It's not good, from start to finish. I do not see it!
