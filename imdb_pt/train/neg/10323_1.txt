I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians, but I found this show not to be funny at all. The producers and the cast are likely to be happy to get good and bad feedback because, as far as they are concerned, it's being discussed! I was ready for some stereotypes and have no problem with that, because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But there was really nothing funny about these stereotyped characters. The father "fresh from the boat", who does not understand his daughter. The radical Muslim feminist daughter (who by the way is a terrible actress), and the modern young Indian trying to run his mosque as politically correct as possible (he is a great actor, I just see him improving). /> <br /> It is very artificial and the dialogue does not flow as well. there was a lot of potential for something like that, but unfortunately I think he failed, and I really do not mind watching another episode. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she is always a treat and a natural in everything she does, too bad that her daughter in the show does not have the same acting skills!
