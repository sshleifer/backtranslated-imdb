Connie Hoffman is very handsome and is attractive topless at times. <br /> <br /> That's it, people. The only reason to even consider whether to watch this movie or not. <br /> <br /> These sexploitation period pieces from the 70's are fun by virtue of their own hardness (wide pants, big hair, mustache Zapata, etc.). This is not. <br /> <br /> The script is bad, the acting is bad, the direction is bad, and the idea of ​​having a senior romantic leader is exceptionally bad. <br /> <br /> The title, insinuating a sex comedy, is grossly misleading. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend avoiding this as the plague.
