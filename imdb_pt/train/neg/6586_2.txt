If you enjoy the revival of Asian terror, do not bother with Gawi. The film hardly deserves mention alongside first-rate works such as Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even a material as good as The Eye or Inner Senses). These films overflow with subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters and a decidedly non-Western view of what is scary. Gawi is tied together with remnants of limbs and organs of all that has made American terror lousy in the last twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> The movie attempts to blend Asian ghost story and Hollywood horror film, but it is a bad fit. One aesthetic is doomed to suffocate the other; Guess which one? Having no story of its own to tell the filmmakers to get Ringu out of a subplot of evil children, the situation is desperate. Clich√©s, filthy characters, dull plot, a dull ghost, ho hum.
