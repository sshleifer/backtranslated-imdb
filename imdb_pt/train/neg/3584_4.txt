Interestingly, it is the eyes and mouth of Rene Russo - not Buddy the Gorilla - that emerge as the focal point of "Buddy," a production of Jim Henson Pictures via Zoetrope by Francis Ford Coppola. Somehow, numerous close-ups of Russo's face slipped through the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so often that the poor monkeys are overshadowed. Unintentionally funny true story adapted from the memories of Gertrude's "Trudy" Davies Lint about the wife of a wealthy doctor who turns his mansion into a zoo for pets and wildlife. The film goes beyond good intentions ... it positively falls with sincere sincerity. The film never shines with the kind of magical "family movie" it needed, and before long people and animals seem clearly programmed (nothing here seems real). About ten minutes later, two chimpanzees are playing in Russo's kitchen and begin to toss a butcher's knife back and forth (she misses Alan Cumming's head by inches); However, no eyebrows are lifted because it is all in a day of fun. Still, when the adult gorilla Buddy goes crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called - and everyone looks at Buddy out the window as he rips the furniture off the living room. Furniture should be the least of anyone's concerns in this frivolous and positive failure. But at least we know that Russo was in good hands: Whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up, she gives Rene unleashed yet another extreme close-up. I wonder what was the lipstick budget in this photo? ** in ****
