This movie was so ridiculous that I never finished watching it, I actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it on the DVD of the movie store. This movie made me sick not because it was bloody, but because I lost 2 50 in it !!!! Looks like my brother and I walked into a house and made the movie and edited the slaughterhouse stuff for him! I'm so annoyed, even the BTK killer deserves more credit than this was not even accurate I mean come on the cow's head was obviously made of clay or BUBBLE GUM OMG I can not even get all the words to explain this DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!
