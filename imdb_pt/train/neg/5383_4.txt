I guess I should start by saying that almost any style of work can be fun in parts. The real test is whether it's good from start to finish, which is why I gave the analog title to this review. Most of us would agree - even those like me, who enjoy reading many blogs - that blogs can not compare to good writing of the novel for several reasons. Similarly, EMF can not compare to good movie production for several reasons, and I really believe it is a bad example of independent filmography. From beginning to end, the FEM looks like a reunited vlog. (Wow, even MySpace gets some money.) If I wanted to see an hour of lonely girl15 - I would not - I would watch. The EMF, though certainly grittier than the media bubble gum atmosphere mentioned, is so personal that it does not have an interesting story. It's like watching the mundanity of life, which I think most would agree would be very naturally boring. And yet, the creators of FEM want us to applaud it, its very postmodern film about making a movie. Cue my yawn. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I go out not caring at all about it at all. I'm shocked that I'm really interested in taking the time to write this review, even. It's not that FEM is completely bad, because it is not; There are some moments when I smile or think maybe - just maybe - something of interest is about to happen. It's more than that it's just ... mediocre. I feel so indifferent about it that it is almost fit for a paradox: passionate indifference. <br /> <br /> I hope the creators / "actors" of the film get out of debt in their efforts. They will probably need this when one of them goes out and move on with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to lose and nothing you want to do; otherwise pass it on and do not worry if you have lost some excellent and undiscovered talent. You really do not.
