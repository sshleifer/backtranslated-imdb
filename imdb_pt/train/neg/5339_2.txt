OK, so I'm like most people, give me free tickets and I'll see most things now that multiplex theaters are so good (I remember the old single screen theaters and I'm the healthy side of the 40's) . In England, this movie was released as "Liar", it's a dog. It is a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for photography and set only.
