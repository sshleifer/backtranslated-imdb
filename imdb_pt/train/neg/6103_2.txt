To be honest, I'm surprised at the positive votes this movie has received. The film drags on during its 81 minutes of life, and the public has to suffer all the time. In fact, there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She gets a pretty pathetic dialogue and deals very well with it. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a very tough watch. I think the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy lying on the beach wearing a tiger print chummies ... give me a break. In addition, Valentine gives us a coarse and pathetic portrait of a suffering vampire who misses the day (to see a much more convincing version of the suffering vampire, see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The movie moves so slowly and is only positively punctuated and, to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This movie can honestly only be recommended to fans of Charlie Spradling (which I am, and I still had a hard time watching!).
