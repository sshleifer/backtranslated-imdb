The fight scenes are like Jackie Chan in slow motion and the intelligence attempts are pathetic (worst profanity from afar: "Guess what? This time I heard you coming"). The stars are an incompatible couple: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and charm of screen - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free (at least in this movie). Note to the director: In the future, please stay away from any love scene, especially when your lead actress does not do any nudity and you have to rely heavily on a double body. (* 1/2)
