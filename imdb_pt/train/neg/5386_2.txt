Although being one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me a good idea, I know a little of what was the first place ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original cut of "entry freshman" and being very satisfied. It was funny, sexy, cheeky, all the major requirements of a drive-in movie. you have to remember that it was filmed and released before everything else ... animal house, porky, etc ... then in its own way, this movie was really ahead of its time. for whatever reason, the film was distributed to the top distributors who edited half of the original film and then edited (shuffled?) the most random scenes of all time. the fat guy, the people with goat heads ... what the hell was all this?! I'm sure it was put to additional T & A, but it was so slow, it caused anything happening before it to grind to a sudden and painful stop. but after all, it's a fun memory for me ... especially in that I can say the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in!
