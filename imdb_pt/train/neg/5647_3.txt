We bought this series on DVD because of all the brilliant reviews we saw here. I gave three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting, direction and writing are brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we do not see the ad that was being broadcast so well in the series. If one observes it with discernment, you will see the whole litany of right-wing radical beliefs being promulgated by the Fox News Network (Faux). To avoid giving spoilers, I will refrain from pointing out all the dozens of specific instances. A brief look at the plots found here on IMDb will reveal that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide infomercials and call them news is justified with cute twists and passionate speeches given by some of the best actors in the world . We watched a lot of spectacles and finally gave up with disgust when they justified the torture using Attorney General Gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting us all. The series also succeeds in lowering male and female gays in subtle ways, using them as plot devices that portray more people. In short, the complete litany of the radical religious right. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America lost its way at the beginning of this century. As a history student, I myself would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and some of the advertisements produced by Hollywood for the American public during World War II. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle advertising can be, then by all means do it. Just make sure you buy a cheap copy used to avoid enriching the right ends on the Faux Network, which produced this farce.
