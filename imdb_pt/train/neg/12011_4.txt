John Pressman (Micheal 'I shoulda called Ditech' Lerner) works in a doctor's office as an orderly. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes him out of people who see that he thinks wronged him. But that ends up being a movie within a movie, but the lines soon go out when John goes to the movies to kill. Indicating a guy who is watching the movie to do the same. Lerner is properly above that, but Zelda repeats lines of dialogue over and over again. This gets annoying fast. But not as boring as the two girls who are watching the movie inside a movie. As a horror movie, this flaw, is too busy trying to be clever, trying to convey a message and seems to forget that a horror movie should evoke a sense of tension, or at least a leap or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of criminal: one of art. <br /> <br /> My notes: D +
