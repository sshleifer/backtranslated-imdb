... And being disappointed greater than ever. I will not do any direct reference or anything here, but to say the least, this movie is pathetic. If you are militarily trained, do not bother to watch. I put it on DVD with 2 friends wanting to watch a rather interesting action / war movie. Why could not I have read the reviews first? <br /> <br /> Already in the first scene of "bomba", the film has great flaws, and they continue to show and to become bigger and bigger. My two friends, not linked to the military in any way, identified a couple of mistakes from the filmmaker almost as fast as I and asked if some of the things that are happening are realistic. Well, as you may have guessed, they are not - not at all. Avoid this movie unless you are able to ignore those completely stupid and recurring mistakes that are being made. 2/10 to catch my interest in the beginning.
