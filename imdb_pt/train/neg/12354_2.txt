Of course I did not watch 'GI Jane' out of your choice. I was more or less forced to watch this movie around the house of my ex-girlfriends. <br /> <br /> GI Jane loses her credibility by immediately trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real setting, which of course it is not. The result is that the story automatically becomes constrained by restrictions, restricting the amount of humor (which does not exist) or entertaining action scenes, and then becomes too serious. The film thus becomes extremely annoying and predictable. "GI Jane" fails where other action movies are successful, mainly because films like James Bond, Dirty Harry and several others are bigger than life, but they never proclaim otherwise. They are escapist and therefore fun. 'GI Jane' tries to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing film by Ridley Scott, with a little credible plot, a little striking performance, and the only reason I give 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some technical work.
