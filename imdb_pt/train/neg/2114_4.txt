Just look at the sets, stage and edit, it's easy to say that this project did not have a proper budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi should take her mind off things like that. Young brides fall dead on the altar after saying "I do". His corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a couple of his weird minions, as his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injections of young virgin glandular fluids to stay young forever ... forever beautiful . An eager local Cuban reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that every missing bride wore the same rare orchid on the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be more experienced. A typical horror movie storm makes a visit to Lorenz's property a little scary; especially with a dwarf and a humpback drooling on the spot. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
