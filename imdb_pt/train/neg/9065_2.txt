About halfway through, I realized that I did not care about these characters at all; however, I watched a little more anyway. Regrettably, I came back the next day and finished. I should not have bothered. <br /> <br /> If you know something about the movie beforehand, you know that the main character will be a survivor of the plane crash - and the title gives a good idea of ​​what is going to happen afterwards - it goes pick up the phone and call people! That was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another bad aviation catastrophe film). <br /> <br /> I realize that this is an old movie, and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than it is today. But even by these standards, the acting was embarrassing. They were not characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect that this film was, more than anything else, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's career (Gary Merrill). Unsuccessfully, however - I have seen the oaks show emotions more genuine than he. <br /> <br /> Davis' playing the happy cripple (that is, a non-glamorous role) was probably regarded as a bold and daring challenge. career movement. It was not. It was just annoying. She was a sort of Tiny Tim in the film, making Trask (Merrill's character) see the truth about love and forgiveness (though she was less endearing than Tiny Tim), distributing wisdom about life and relationships without the slightest insinuation that your beloved husband I just died. <br /> <br /> The final scene, where Trask calls his wife in Iowa to reconcile, was so affected and overworked at both ends of the phone line that I almost cringed. I had to remind myself that these people really got paid for what they were doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> I noticed a lot of people seem to have liked this movie. If you find it edifying, great. But frankly, I just thought it was bad. There are many old Hollywood Golden Age films that have been much better written and interpreted.
