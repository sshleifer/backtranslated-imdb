I hired this movie expecting a few laughs, hopefully enough to amuse myself, but I was very much mistaken. This film showed minimal moments of humor and the pathetic jokes cringed me with shame to always hire you ... Targeting a 10 to 15 year age group, this movie will surely leave viewers outside these borders feeling very dissatisfied. Not worth more than 3 votes highly recommended for those who do not want to waste 2 hours of their lives.
