This movie was definitely the worst movie I've seen in my entire life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I did not like the way this movie was filmed. All the actors are unknown, and it seems that a group of friends got together and decided to film their own movie. but it's absolutely awful. I've never seen a movie worse. the story is so fake, and I just found out it took a long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it looked like it was not planned before they started filming. The story is very strange. I did not like how long it took to get to the point of the movie. there was no point filming this movie. If you are thinking of watching this movie, do not. You're just wasting your time.
