How have I enjoyed this failure of a sequel? All you do is play balls! Worst of all, it does not even compare to the first installment of the series! Comedy suffers from not being funny. Where did all the unintentional laughter go? Pretty slapstick action in the field goes on for a long time. Bob Uecker literally saved this one from a full nine-way closure. Which is next, the main league 4: return to the small league? Ehh, it could be! Leave this on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star Game. This one has had three major strikes.
