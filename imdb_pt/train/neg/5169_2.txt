ATTENTION: I would advise anyone who has not yet seen the movie not to read this review. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen them all, The Hamiltons certainly delivered a bit of entertainment, which did not happen. entertain me in everything !!!! I thought, in common with semi-bad acting, stupid plot scheme, and the twist at the end of the movie, which was very retarded, this movie sucked !!! Ok, so supposively these are people who eat other people. Yes ...... warning I said non-human people, not because they are not human, or wait I think they are, OH NO WAIT, THEY DID NOT SAY !!!! So, alright, these people are cannibals, or are they imbred, or what are they? I mean, maybe they are just "stuff" that came here to see the taste of people or, they are cannibals who ate people for a long time now, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE! WHAT IS IT! So if you think the Hamiltons is good, I ask you, why, why, why, why it was so amazing, because for me it was just a terrible off !!! A great BOOOOOOO! Go see The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail, or Borderland for an entertaining piece !!!!!
