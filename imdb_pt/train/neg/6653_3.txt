I just saw this movie and I must say it was a great waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) can not act. She read her lines very naturally, and she had a very unnatural facial expression throughout the film. Rosanna Munter, who played Petra, on the other hand, is natural. She played her role with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we've seen it many, many times before. She separates, he finds another, she gets jealous, he ends up with the other girl and they end up getting together at the end. There were no surprises, it was known that Eve would separate and that Adam would "bond" with Petra. The only thing no one saw was that Petra told Adam to go after Eve at the party. She got serious, which is one side of Petra that viewers had not seen at the beginning of the movie, and told him to win Eve's heart back, which was very cute. <br /> <br /> In addition to Rosanna Munter, there is a single actor who makes a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend it!
