This film was a big disappointment towards, intellectual niveau, plot and the way you handled your subject, painting. It's a slow motion movie that resembles an episode of Wonder Years, with a terrifying depth of depth. Nor can you convey your message convincingly. <br /> <br /> The approach to the subject of painting is very elitist, limited to vague and subjective terms like "beauty". According to the creators of this film, "beauty" can only be experienced in kitsch landscape paintings in the Bob-Ross style. A good art, according to this film, can be obtained by applying the basic theory of colors (as in primary school) and a lot of feeling. In some parts the film is offensive, for example at one point, it is stated (on the contrary, celebrated by dancing on the tables) that mentally disabled people are not able to have emotions or express them through painting, their works, by definition, 'citation' are useless. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the movie could get such a high rating, so again, so far few people have rated it, and they have chosen only very high or very low ratings.
