Wow, this movie was a great success. I heard that this movie expresses very well the meaning of friendship. And with all the Internet hype in this movie did I realize what could go wrong? However, the movie was just plain bad. It was boring and character development was never there. Space Travelers was also a horrible movie, if you did not like this movie, there's no way you like it.
