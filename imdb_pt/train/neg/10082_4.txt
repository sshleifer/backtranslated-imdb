I laughed all this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a collapse in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes out and offers you a job !!! Hilarious! The next thing you know the two women are going for it. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing sounds true in this movie "Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do". Clumsy dialogues like "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling that I had the chance to be happy and did not accept" do not help. There is a rich and distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A daring black maid - unbelievable that in 2003, a movie was made in which there is a daring black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be rummaging in the grave. The woman has a husband who goes crazy and wants the custody of the grumpy teenage children. Sheesh! No clich√© is left out.
