Whereas I felt like picking up a new Jet Li movie to see some, but kicking and fighting hand in hand without a brain, I took that title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie contains more battles with guns (Wing Chow Yun Fat, but not nearly as good), as Jet Li and the company's acrobatic battles. So it was a disappointment. The fight against the tap was interesting and even funny, considering that this was something totally unexpected in a Jet Li movie for me, more in the vein of saying Jackie Chan. <BR> But I would recommend the Fist of Legend, the Tai Chi Master, or even the Enforcer about this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for the overall movie score
