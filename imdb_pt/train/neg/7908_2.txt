I did not expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold. Still, I waited. It sounded a bit like "Bride and Prejudice". (L.A. guy falls in love with Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was a nice movie with some good laughs and friendly characters. <br /> <br /> "My fiancee from Bollywood" had none of it. The acting seemed flushed and the way to the numbers. The characters were so clich√©d that the story seemed to have been written by a first-year high school drama student. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seemed like there was a lot of dialogue dubbing. I mean a lot. I know that sometimes it is necessary but it seems like half of the movie was filmed in a closet and it became very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Two stars are being generous.
