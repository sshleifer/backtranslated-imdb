Here we have two misunderstood children who have never had a chance against a cruel and poverty-stricken existence: Robin Hoods was singled out by police for persecution because they were a bit wild at times. Gad! According to this crap, Bonnie was the sweetest thing in Missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic killer by a fun boyfriend who really did not want to hurt anyone ... he just wanted things without much energy to get them. Unbelievable dialogue, misinterpreted, poorly filmed, unrealistic use of arms, blood that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing. Avoid this bilgewater. Thumbs down. -5 stars.
