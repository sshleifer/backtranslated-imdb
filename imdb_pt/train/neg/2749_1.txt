This movie was very poorly written. The characters had no depth. They should never have made a film about it. My 11-year-old son could write a better script than Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor he did not like was the zoo keeper. He was the only funny and believable of the group. <br /> <br /> I love movies and I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was on my list at number 2. Being Demonicus. <br /> <br /> For those of you who really thought this was a good movie, you are seriously in need of brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the movie were not even dragons ... so why did they call it D-war?
