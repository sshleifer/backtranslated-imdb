Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfortable drama about parents and children, adult irresponsibility and aging. Billy plays a cardiac surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) that makes him look for his father (Alan King), an extra movie that considers himself a big star. The script is sub-Neil Simon absurd, with an abundance of phrases, a flat and unimpressive direction of Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode) and ready family conflicts. Crystal and King try their best, but King is overly anxious and often exaggerated. JoBeth Williams has another of her ungrateful roles, but she manages to bring her innate class home to the proverbial girlfriend character. It's a comedy, I think, but one that blinks tears ... shamefully. ** in ****
