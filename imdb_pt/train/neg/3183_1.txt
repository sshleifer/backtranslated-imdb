Sergio Leone turns on his grave ... If there was any movie that stumbles a man's life, this is it. The main character's "lone wolf" bravado is uninteresting and lame, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight-year education. Whatever the idea, it should be whipped on horseback. The only reason I'm wasting time is because there are a minimum of 10 lines. The family of Sergio Leone should sue, not for his crap, but because he is now immortalized as trash by the MST 3000. Shame. Disgusted. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey does shit that does not offend anyone, but cocaine users and gun specialists ... this movie is pure blasphemy.
