Yes I think. It is hard to say. It's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion. This film is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. For a scenario, there are some stone pillars, some stone seats, some stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a work of incredibly written literature. The dubbing really was not so bad. The voices remained true to the somber, gloomy, somber, life-sucking atmosphere the film conveyed. I saw this version of Hamlet at the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of three times, I was about to turn off the TV, despite being the MST 3K. <br /> <br /> Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves much better.
