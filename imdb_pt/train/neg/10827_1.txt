This ambitious film suffers most from the delusions of grandeur of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Highly derived from much better material ("Nashville" by Altman, "Lumet Network"), this heavy elephant takes a long time to get nowhere. Some mistaken deviations along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) do not help at all. Nor the uneven level of performances. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and plot could easily have been eliminated altogether; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing anguish. And how many times must we see John C. Reilly's shick Sad Sack ("Chicago" and "The Hours" will suffice)? Tom Cruise does well for comparison? his foul-mouthed, muddy Holy Roller was quite amusing. Speaking of dirty mouths, the script was so full of "F" bombs, which lost their impact in a short time. Nor talk about that horrible soundtrack, full of insipid and irritating Aimee Mann vocals. His extended version of "One," a sentimental number to begin with, led me to the distraction at the beginning of the movie. I should have heard the calligraphy on the wall and saved me another three hours when I was pushed to the edge of hell. One redeeming feature, which I have not seen mentioned in other reviews, is the group's best performance, by the unknown Melora Walters as Claudia, the self-destructive coke addict. His credibility far surpassed all others. This movie was taken very seriously and just did not know when it's over.
