The lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before the "yes" with the groom Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years, Henry still has not moved and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very worried. Chloe makes Henry talk to an attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley must get in touch with Kate's spirit hoping to help Henry get on with his life. When the psychic begins to feel attracted to Henry, Kate's ghost seems to nip the novel by the roots. There are some funny situations; but if you saw the trailers, you saw the substance of the movie. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought Bell stole Parker's show. And Biggs, as usual, a pain in the ass. Still, this movie was very exaggerated.
