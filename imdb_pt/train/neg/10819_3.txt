I agree with one of the other commentators on good story and good actors, but incompatible, and I would also say in a hurry. It's been about 24 years since I read the book how it was at school. But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when I watched this while the bits are left out and therefore does not make sense. For example, Jane and Mr. Rochester barely speak and suddenly he is proposing marriage !!! The actors do not have time to let audiences know how their character feels about every single thing going on in the story. The actors are good, but they do not get enough time to do justice to this story. Sorry to say that, but I really did not like this version. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C Scott would be Jane Eyre's film of my choice, but you should check out the 1983 mini-series of the BBC with Zelah Clarke. & Timothy Dalton in the two major roles. I love it so much that I watch it regularly. There is an abbreviated version that goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins.
