One wonders why someone would try to redo successful movie frames that have already been seen, as is the case with this movie. "The Wedding Date" is one of the best examples of why not try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been left in peace. If a project like this goes ahead with studio approval of great honchos, then go with big stars and brilliant production values, so people will come to the stars. <br /> <br /> It happens in this misguided attempt of comedy. The problem seems to be the way screenwriters transplanted the story to London, when it basically seems like a typical American situation that even the setting can not fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! Since Kat and Nick have no conflict from the outset, the viewer is not drawn to the film in the way the creators thought they would be. Of course Kat will fall in love with Nick, and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in "Junebug," appears as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie on course and not be cleaned to the man who loves her and is going to marry her. <br /> <For those who are interested, the credits at the end of the film last almost seven minutes!
