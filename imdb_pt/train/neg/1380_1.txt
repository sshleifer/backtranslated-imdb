This was the worst movie I saw on WorldFest and also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think that it is receiving this recognition based on the amount of actors known in the film. It's great to see J.Beals, but she's only in the movie for a few minutes. M. Parker is a far better actress than the part allowed. The rest of the acting is difficult to judge because the film is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unfriendly and therefore a hole to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie about an actor who can not work does not seem very original to me. Nor the development of the police. It looks like one of the many direct video films I've seen in the '90s ... and not even a good one in those standards. <br /> <br />
