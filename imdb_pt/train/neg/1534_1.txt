From the scanned footage in blocks to the acting that makes Keanu "I'm so wooden I could be a Prank me" Reeves looks like an Oscar winner this movie bites (pun intended unintentionally). The best thing about this is the eRATicate box in the second segment (which of all three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of plot and twist). I wish I spent the Â£ 3.99 that cost me in something else, as erm .... Natural Born Killers: Court of Directors. If you buy this, you're really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you are looking for something amateur and with actors who are more wood than a 2x4, then go ahead. However, if you want some quality werewolf action, look elsewhere, such as Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The Hunt Werewolf.
