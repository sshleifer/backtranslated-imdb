this has become a cult film in Chinese college students, although I have not watched it until broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK. <br /> <br /> full of artistic pretensions, the plot is mediocre and unreal; the 'spirit' he wants to convey is how independent artists 'resist the commodification of the music industry' and maintain their 'purity of an artistic soul' and would not 'sell themselves for dirty money.' this is really dull and shallow; the diologists are mostly pathetic. acting is bad. The sceenplay is full of artistic pretensions. It's a fantasy movie for kids and that's all <br /> <br />
