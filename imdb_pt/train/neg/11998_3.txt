this is a terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> first of all TOOO long. the longest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Stories are too damn Over the Top !!!! <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many stories that story The line is ruined. <br /> <br /> comedy was not comedy !!!!! it was not funny at all ... <br /> <br /> the story is so repulsive and poorly written that it does not matter if the characters live or die ....... <br /> <br /> I had some expectations of this movie ......... but my expectations were completely broken in the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> the only good thing about this movie is the MUSIC .... .. and obviously Vidya Balan. she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors ...... she is just a newcomer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the Loire that interprets their love interest also help to save this disastrous film. Govinda fits perfectly into the taxi driver's role. and the blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance .... Another talented actress, Ayesha Takiya, is completely lost in this movie !!!! so it's priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay does his part well, but he seemed far above the top !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also totally wasted ...... <br /> <br /> the only one that is not wasted is Salman Because he has no talent to be wasted !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> All this is a very Impossible movie with script Mishmashed and TOOO Masladar that the plot is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes. imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 is four hours long !!!! think and RETHINK before going to the movies !!!!! better avoid this !!!!!
