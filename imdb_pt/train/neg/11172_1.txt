The hugely popular "I Love the 80's" of 2002 is a stupid, offensive, and utterly disgusting pop culture mess that was the first of a long series of horrible television shows that ended the end of VH1, only time, the only real channel oriented music left on TV! I used to pretty much live on VH1 until spring or winter, I forgot which one right now, from 2002, when garbage like that started popping up for absolutely no reason. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I guess that's what you'd call it) I decided I'd go ahead and take a look anyway the first night it happened, even though the ads looked like crap. At least I can honestly say that I was not a bit disappointed with this because my expectations were obviously basic at the basement level to begin with. The emphasis of this program I discovered in the first 5 minutes was smaller in each year of the 80s and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (which is what I expected to see), but rather an improvised platform. by a whole series of really unnamed god-named comedians to show what they more than likely think are their comedic abilities * roll their eyes * ... more like lack of it if you ask me! Now it's pretty easy to see why no one has ever heard of any of these idiots before they show up on this show because they're all so terribly unhappy and pathetic in their so-called "humor" attempts that I swear I can feel my guts. one-liner they shot one after another! All in all, I have no problem saying "I love the 80s" was / is the litter of the smallest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore.
