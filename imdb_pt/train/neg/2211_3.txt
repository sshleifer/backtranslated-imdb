Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny, that sums up this movie in one word. What crap was this "thing", since it could kill me to use the word movie!?!?! I hope the director, writer and producer did not want to say that this would be good because it certainly did not! A scientist turning his son into a hammerhead shark, and the shark killing a lot of people the scientist invited to the island !!! I hate this movie so much that when I was watching I laughed at all the serious parts because they were so cheeky and unprofessional ... and they could not have made the shark seem more unrealistic, even though that "thing" had a budget a little higher than most low budget movies. All I have to say is watch this movie hoping to laugh at all the bad acting, and idiot dialogues, because if you're expecting a good movie, I'll be highly disappointed.
