Murders are taking place in a Texas desert town. Who is responsible? Slight novelties of mystery and racial tensions (the latter does not really fit), but otherwise strictly for slasher fans, who will appreciate the blood and nudity, which are two conventional elements for these films. <br /> Dana Kimmell (from Friday, 13th part of the infamy) is the spoiled teenage detective. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for violence and gore, nudity and some language.
