First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and start doing the job. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman is going out to do some work for his masters, why waste almost a third of the film on those sequels. So Hackman stays in a hotel and the arc of history is not going anywhere, simply proving to us that Hackman is under surveillance and everything he says or does is known to the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more time wasted showing the meeting with his wife. All of this should take 10 to 15 minutes at the most, simply as a setting for real action, intrigues and plot twists. By the time the actual action begins, I was so bored I just wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great, as usual, and the other actors too, but this is a failure of the first magnitude.
