"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; It's a terrible movie. Is it possible that the audiences and critics of American films are so numb and lobotomized by Hollywood droppings that they will praise up to the skies for even a mediocre movie with almost no laughter? That's the only reason I can think of why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use that term loosely because there's nothing funny in this movie) is getting good reviews. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie that stunned screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel until they would think his screenplay was funny. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well into film. He adapted "Fever Pitch" to a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was Americanized for a movie in 2000, writers D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not make a mistake because they kept the essence of Hornby's wit and humor. They made one of the best films that year. <br /> <br /> So why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" so painfully wrong? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters that we could like, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel excised everything for free in Hornby's work. By Americanizing the story, they massacred it, removing all that was good and unique about Hornby's work and replacing it with a conventional dribble. <br /> <br /> They turned a funny story into a stereotypical romantic comedy, never once straying from the miserable formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends, each with a different role. One is overweight, the second is cynical and ambitious, and the third is a romantic. Want to guess how many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) have? <br /> <br /> What made "High Fidelity" so fun was not only a good protagonist and a protagonist, but also supporting characters. In this "Fever Pitch", the six supporting friends do or do not say anything especially funny. They are so insignificant that they are neither decorative. The only reason they are in the movie is because the formula requires this. Poor Ione Skye ends up as one of Lindsey's friends in an ungrateful role. The lovely Skye must have been hoping Lloyd Dobler would come and take her away. Come to think of it, Cusack would have made an excellent Ben. Of course, Cusack is too smart to cling to such a tedious script. <br /> <br /> There is not a single lonely moment in this movie that looks original or non-forced. Every turn in the plot is predictable, every cable-free joke telegraphed. Ganz and Mandel work to laugh. The first 45 minutes are so horribly slow you wonder if these guys realized they were writing a comedy. You can mark the plot twists on your watch. It's almost as if Ganz and Mandel wrote this with the formula of a screenwriting guru stuck to the wall. When they came to a certain page, they looked at the formula and said, "OK, the guru says it has to happen now." And ready! <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the movie. They have no idea how to present their story and characters (they deliver the VO narration not to the protagonist but to the other guy who is sitting behind Ben at Fenway Park). Thanks to some extremely awkward writings, we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble in their bland initial meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is cuter and lovelier than most. She is as good as Goldie Hawn in her prime. But even his cuteness can not save this extraordinarily terrible movie. She tries hard to extract some energy and humor from this story. About 30 minutes after the movie, Lindsey tells Ben, "You're funny." The only explanation for her comment is that it was in the script. For Fallon, Ben never says anything even remotely funny. Fallon is neither witty nor funny; When he plays comedy, he excels. <br /> <br /> Fallon was never good at "Saturday Night Live." He was possibly the least funny person on that show. Remember that stupid sketch about a radio DJ that made all the voices? The only reason "Weekend Update" worked occasionally was because Fallon Bunny, Tina Fey, knew a thing or two about comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they are funny and behave so seldom, or ever, are really funny. This is true of Fallon. He thinks he's hysterically funny when he barely laughs. His stuttering and insecure manner did not work on the little screen; it's worse on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this image also requires some dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait until you get a lot of drama. Two scenes in particular - the first in a park, the second in front of Ben's school - are painful to watch. The scenes require an actor with a hint of dramatic ability, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. His range of emotions does not even go from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no personality or depth. Often he appears like an imbecile. And not an amiable one at that. This confuses the mind that Lindsey would find attractive about him. Compare Fallon's performance to that of Firth in the British version, and you'll understand how Ben is awfully boring, bland and forced from Fallon, and how he's wrong for that role. Watching Fallon in "Fever Pitch" makes a long time for the dramatic depth and comical nuance of Ashton Kutcher! As High Fidelity did, an Americanized "Fever Pitch" might have worked brilliantly. All it needed was better writers, more competent directors, and definitely a stronger, smarter, smarter leader. Do yourself a great favor: avoid this rotten movie; Rent the British version of 1997 and read Hornby's book.
