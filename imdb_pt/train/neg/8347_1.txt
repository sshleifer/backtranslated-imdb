The title should have been "The Walker." It was only him who walked. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in the movie that was good. The description of the film is not really in line with the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the movie is that it was a good son, but a terrible low life person. <Br/> <br /> I'm sorry for wasting my money and time on this movie. I saw people coming out of the theater in the middle of the movie. I was hoping it would be better ... what a mistake. I got worse. <br /> <br /> If there is one suggestion I can make for it, the producer is redirecting his life to another field, because making movies is definitely not his cup of tea.
