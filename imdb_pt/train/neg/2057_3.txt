Sorry to go against the flow, but I thought this movie was unreal, boring and too long. I got tired of watching Gena Rowlands, an arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing. Maybe the film has some cinematographic value or it represents an important step for the director, but for pure entertainment value I would have liked to have jumped.
