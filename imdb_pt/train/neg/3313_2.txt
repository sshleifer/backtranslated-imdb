How can anyone say that this movie is a comedy? If I had not gone with my finacee, I would have fallen asleep and would have asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like she was on the wrong set. I like most girl movies, but I hated that. This is the only time I saw both clevage and was not connected. These clothes were too exaggerated. No one talks this way anymore and I do not think they did until then. The dance part was horrible. My ex told me later ... "Did not you like that part? Did not you think that was wise?" I said yes just to spare your feelings. Now I know why we never got married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
