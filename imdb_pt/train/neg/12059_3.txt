The 80s were not very kind to actor Charles Bronson. Beginning with "Death Wish II" from 1982 and ending with this really horrible 1989 movie, the Bronson writers seemed to be trying to outdo each other with a progressive rudeness. "D.W. II" left little to the imagination in his description of the rape and suicide of Bronson's character's daughter, (a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail). "10 to Midnight" was the kind of disgusting movie that made you want to take a shower afterwards. Nothing redeeming about it. Other films such as "The evil that men do" and the remaining "Desire of Death" films of this period set the line between the high field and the high deer with their sincere depictions of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick out of showing a weary old Bronson, old citizen destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but the crappy craftsmanship (and terrible scripts) of these the films usually destroyed the little energy they could have generated. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these movies - is pretty well done, but it really does take the cake in cinematic disgrace. In this film Bronson: Sodomizes a wicked john; compels a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; makes remarkably xenophobic remarks, among other things that I have happily forgotten. Also described is the collective rape of a young Japanese woman (fortunately, this was off-screen, though well implied). <br /> <br /> What were people thinking when they made this movie? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with those horrible movies? For anyone interested in his best films, check out most of the films he did in the '60s and' 70s, such as "The Mechanic," "Death Wish," "From Noon to Three," "Once Upon a Time in the West," "Red Sun", "The Great Escape", "The Magnificent Seven", "Knight in the Rain", etc, etc ....
