This is the worst show ever. Buntch's grown up acting like children without humor at all. Even Sesame Street has more humor and more adult than friends "Friends" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on television and I've sat in front of the tube watching Friends "simply does not compare to others, contemporary He does not have to elegance of "Seinfeld" and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of "Frasier." The characters in "Friends" seem designed to make them disgusting idiots.This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl. The non-intelligent show is completely without any kind of advantage, the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric - though intentionally. (It may be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim less than his abilities, so as not to confuse the loyal friends of "Friends.")
