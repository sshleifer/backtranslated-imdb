knew nothing about the movie or was based on a bestseller. I tried to guess in the opening scenes about what would be, better guess, buried treasure and a list of dead. This lasted about 15 minutes when I got the movie. suspected the movie was crap. I will not bore you with how bad was the plot and the acting, but anyone who has given more than two stars should work for the filmmakers. I watched until the hero jumped on his corvette to run the hospital. He had his in his suit, shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and t-shirt. I could never get the continuity right. I have the Christian theme, hard to miss it.
