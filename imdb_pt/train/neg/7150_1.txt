After seeing the previews, I felt that this movie would be a good improvement over this fast and furious series. So, I already hoped it had a missing plot, but at least this time will not be loaded with a lot of impotent civility with fart cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could imagine a Fast and Furious movie with a worse story than by all means this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm being cool - no, I would not take baseball bat to my balls like what others have said). Not only did the plot not exist, but the action was crap too. I think the director thought they could just throw a bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For example there is a point in the movie where the guy presses the button on us and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a McLaren SLR to win. And after the part where Eddy Griffin fought with one of his "girls" (a comment from Imus would work in that case), the girl asks to stop and leave the plane and, of course, in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene, I could not take it anymore. So I could only see half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I've ever had. Then I had to stop for a few drinks to kill all the corrupted brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave 1 because 0 is not an option. You're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip set on the way home. I will keep all the bystanders in my prayers.
