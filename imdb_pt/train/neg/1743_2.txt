Unlike its title, this film does not offer seasoning and therefore the audience is subjected to a tasteless dish. All Humor seems forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of the Pakistani pieces available on video, including even the mannerisms. Everyone is screaming, screaming and doing weird things for no reason. The premise seems interesting, as it is a direct survey of Hollywood's Boeing Boeing. John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all his films, is a complete misfit. If we keep the morality factor aside, even so bizarre events seem banal. Kumar and Paresh Rawal, both experienced, try hard to lift the film being natural, but in vain. At least the characters of three girls should be contrasting to bring some interesting elements, but unfortunately also here they all seem brainless. , bimbettes (3Bs) that speak, behave and even scream quite similarly. The biggest hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls in their same house, pretending they will never know about each other? have sex, what else? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways. So, both drama without reason is not something the audience will digest easily. But surely, great meat show and tempting promos always gives s uch films a great initial. Now, to those who call it situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. Sense of humor from such a movie audience is certainly corrupt and demented as they are connecting to a kind of sadistic, weird and maddening humor where not the characters they laugh at but in themselves and in themselves frustrations that it seems so meaningless that we have to bear such things in order to laugh?
