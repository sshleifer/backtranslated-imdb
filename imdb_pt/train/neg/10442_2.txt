The whole internet buzz aside, this movie was horrible. I hoped the movie was more of a hoax than anything. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious thriller / horror movie, and they completely lost. There were only a few good parts and some good lines from Samuel Jackson. Other than that, it was a lot of blood and a few badly animated snakes. All the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie. Now that the movie really came out, I hope this joke dies. Do not waste your time or money on this exaggerated piece of junk. If you are looking for something that is fun and funny, just go to Snakes on a Blog.
