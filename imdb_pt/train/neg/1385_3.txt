"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" was a disappointment. I was told it was a kind of "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The film was barely nicknamed or the soundtrack did not work out with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was very bad. There was very little reflection on the English version of this film and appealed only to the genre "action without meaning". It's not a movie I'd like to see again.
