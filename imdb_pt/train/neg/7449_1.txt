Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Many absent characters, no romantic scenes, plot changes, very short, seemed to be low budget. Dialogue is hardly enough to understand the story if you are unfamiliar with the novel. In some scenes, it seems that Lorna has a sore on her upper lip. I'm sure the makeup did its best to hide it. I guess they did not want to stop filming until it healed, sorry. Most likely because this movie missed kissing scenes. Just a disappointing kissing scene at the end. Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and should be said true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much nicer, and more faithful to the book.
