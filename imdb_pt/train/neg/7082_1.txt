Ok, I wrote a blunt review b / c the movie is horrible. As I was expecting another comment (for Derrida) mine to appear, I decided to check out old reviews of this horrible movie. Look at all the positive comments. EVERYONE, I say EVERYONE, comes from collaborators who have not evaluated any other film beyond this. Crimminy! and wait until the review of "rosebud" [sic]. <br /> <br /> Check out the other movies commented on rosebud and we got great recommendations for. Ah, shoot them, they are the only other films of the two writers and director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as a screenwriter, and Tony, you can not get rid of a bad script. No work for you! ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A FILM WITH LOW CLASSIFICATION!
