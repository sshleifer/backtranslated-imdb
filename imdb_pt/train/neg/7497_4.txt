After seeing the trailer for this movie and discovering that Spike Lee was driving, I was excited to hear about this event. I was not alive at the time, I did not live in New York, so I expected more of a history class than anything else. What I got was an interesting performance, a lot of sex and about 30 minutes of film that really had something to do with Sam's Son. I think the movie was not about Sam's Son, but it was a peek in the summer of 1977. Label me disappointed. <br /> <br />
