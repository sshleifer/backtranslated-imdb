When this cartoon first aired, I got the impression that it would be at least half way down, boy, I was wrong. I must admit that watching this drawing is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney so many years ago. I watched a few episodes and two of them had Batman literally being kicked left and right by the penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat the Batman shit and I watched another episode in which Batman got his butt kicked again by the Joker, who apparently was using Jackie Chan's motions as he launched into the air like a ninja. Since when was the Joker or the Penguin a game for Batman? and even worse when it was fellow Joker and Penguin Kung Fu by Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, depressing and sad the way the Batman image is portrayed in this show. The animation is horrible and the dialogue is terrible. Being a fan of Batman since my childhood I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all costs because it does not project the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like an aspiring Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon I highly recommend Batman the Animated Series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and do not waste your time with this cartoon.
