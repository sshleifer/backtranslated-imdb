*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... From here on, the whole movie collapses. First we find a dishonest program with the indication that we're going to get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and stuff like that. We caught a guy in a slow accent talking of endless trash, two "ghosts" that serve no real purpose and have no such common character and a bunch of henchmen. Someone told me that they are vampires (straight from Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I did not realize it. <br /> <br /> The funny guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as Oracle, only for much longer and much worse. It has a simple point about cause and effect, it does, so it continues to do so and do it until it becomes complicated and stupid. Your final line before you leave is comparable to the "you know what happens to a frog ..." line on X-men, in absolute evil levels. The chocolate cake is such a lazy and pathetic clich√© and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing but what we expect the moment we see her. <br /> <br /> And then we have another kung fu fight !!! BECAUSE? Neo is, supposedly, the only one. He can do anything. He has the supreme power and for what he uses it. Bloody kung fu all the time. And while he can stop 1000 bullets, he is still cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 indecipherable henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see hallucinatory powers. I wanted to see him doing the craziest and craziest people because he can do anything. I have the same as before without the 'wow'. <br /> <br /> The legendary car chase. This can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's not just what we've been, it would be. ALL the cool pictures of this scene are in the trailer. All. So everyone possibly Wow was taken from us, so all we have now is a good chase sequence with, guess what, a kung fu fight !!! OK, it's not Neo, but you thought he would have explained to his closest friends about the reality of The Matrix. At least he taught them something. Is not difficult. "Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what happens to you in the womb." "It's not real, as long as you understand that nothing is real, so nothing can really hurt you." <br /> <br /> There you go. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, so the chase is not bad. It is never boring and it does not seem like 16 minutes. It is so below expectations. And yet, it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The final climax of the movie is probably the worst imaginable. They have all this elaborate plan that involves three teams. They then only show this sporadically between the long monologue, Morpheus' super preacher. To make matters worse, they never clearly define what this plan is that needs 3 teams. You know basically, but you do not know who is doing what, when, then when a team comes down you just do not care and you do not know how that will affect what happens. <br /> <br /> I'll summarize, happens Trinity can go back to the Matrix to set the final. That's the only reason this happens. Which raises the question: why did they need to send 6 people originally? Trinity arrives in five minutes on her own! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the center of the Matrix (so to speak) is treated lazily. Ooohhh !!! He runs to over 100 Smith agents! Woooooo !!! That must have taken a lot of attention. Only now they are in a hall, so the fight has no scale and ends in a moment. Dude, what a great ending !!! <br /> <br /> And then the Architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember that everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreigner? Join them and duplicate, this is how the architect is truly shocking. His only reasonable potential is that he is about to set the climax that is coming. <br /> <br /> And then it explodes! <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the options he gives to Neo. Choose a door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose others and all humanity dies !!! To consider the choice is something that this film tries to explore, is not a hero. If he had a choice of saving mankind and mistress dying or saving his mistress and killing humanity, there is the potential for internal torment and tension. In addition, with Trinity being mid-fall, the potential of a true cliffhanger would have made seeing the third most essential. But not. He does not save anyone or save his mistress. <br /> <br /> Now the worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and coming back to life in the end. In the year he left everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was that they did not realize that the ending of The Matrix made him look like Steven Hawking. "The Oracle told me that I would fall in love with the One, and I love you" .... Let's go !!!! How could the whole world have lost how terrible that was? <br /> <br /> So, what do the Wachowski do in sequence? Well, they make the end of the original look better. As? Well, doing almost exactly the same thing again (just changing characters), but much worse, I think my f and r keys would be wasted if I kept typing long before it got worse. <br /> <br /> And the cliffhanger is not really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. <br/> <br/> Basically, this movie is just plain bad. I really did not want it to be bad, but it is. Bad in so many ways. And to make matters worse, this is not a budget movie. It's not a movie with a very short schedule. It's not a movie that was rushed. It's not a movie in which a lot of influence has come from outside. This is exactly the movie that the Wachowski set out to do with Warner's fortune behind them. And that's what makes it so horrible. At least, Rancid Aluminum can say he did not have enough time or money. Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe it's not like that. The most disappointing and unfavorable film of all time. <br /> <br /> Undeniably. <br /> <br />
