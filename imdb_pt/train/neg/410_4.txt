Unfortunately, one of the best efforts ever made in the area of ​​special effects was made completely senseless by being placed next to a heavy, silly and equally useless plot and an inappropriate script and cliché. Hollow Man is a pretty useless movie. <br /> <br /> Virtually everything seen here has been done to the death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the elevator shaft!) - with the only genuinely intriguing element of the movie being the stunning special effects. However, it's just the same special effect done over and over, and at the end of the movie that was made to death as well. I was hoping, before watching the Hollow Man, that the theme of Invisible Man, which is little original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. This is not so. It does not take long for the film to become an overly familiar bloodbath and a mass of ineffectual histriones - the pile of clichés accumulates so fast that it's almost overwhelming. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a very useless job and his supporting cast is hardly trying his best. Good points may be a reasonable score by Jerry Goldsmith (but no competition for his best efforts), a very interesting use of thermal imaging and special effects. I was tempted to give this movie three in ten, but the effects boosted the Hollow Man's merit to a point. <br /> <br /> 4/10
