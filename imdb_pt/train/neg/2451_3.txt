This movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything I've ever seen. Really, if you are a fan of Tolkien, rent it just to laugh at it with your friends. I will not be the millionth person to rip your flaws ... all I'm going to say is that the movie (to me at least) missed important points by turning my favorite character, Sam, into a clumsy idiot. Shame, shame ...
