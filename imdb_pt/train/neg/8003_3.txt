Do not be fooled like I was by the "bright" comments quoted in the DVD box. "Wildly entertaining," "a seriously scary freakout," and worst of all, "ON PAR WITH JAWS." This movie is none of the above. <br /> <br /> Normally I do not bother writing bad reviews for movies, but I can not believe this movie is resting on a comfy 7 on IMDb. Does not deserve. <br /> <br /> After a daylight attack opened by a monster created by, what more, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, this movie is not going anywhere and goes there fainting. Basically and unlikely, a girl is stolen by the monster (I'll give them points for good creature design, but this is not WETA's creation) and her half-comic family spends an hour and a half tracking it ... in the sewers around the Han River. Their quest no longer has suspense - someone called it Jaws - and when they find it, you realize it was all very meaningless. Other than that, a large part of the film is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in a funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. That was bad. I'm not kidding. Do you want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.
