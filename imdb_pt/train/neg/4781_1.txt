This may be the poorest example of amateur propaganda of all time. Writers and producers should study the German films of the thirties and forties. They knew how to sell. Even a clumsy Soviet-style leader as a divine father figure was best done. Disappointing. The loss of faith, recovered in the church at the last second, just in time for Dad to be "saved" by the Hoover / God was not so bad. Unfortunately, he seemed rushed and not nearly melodramatic enough. A few misty, heavenly shots from the sky of the angelic Hoover at the corner of the screen, smiling and shaking his head - would have added a lot. The best aspect is Hoover saving only the family and deserving children who have "proven" their worth. Unfortunately, other poor homeless people have been portrayed as friendly and even good, but the Hoover-God does not help them. A better approach would have been to shoot them drinking spirits to show the justice of their condition. Finally, bright and cheerful scenes of recovery (after Hoover saved the country from depression) should have rolled in the end. We could see then how Hoover-God had saved not only this deserving family but all the deserving ones. Amateur at best.
