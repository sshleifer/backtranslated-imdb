Drew Barrymore is an actress who has gone through bad times, not only in her career but also in her personal life. After being a child prodigy prodigy, she descended into obscurity with mediocre low-quality films. While she has recovered from this dark past, this film remains a reminder of Drew Barrymore's worst days. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting premise, much like Brian De Palma's "Raising Cain" with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story of a terror / suspense. Barrymore star as Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event from her past in which her other personality apparently killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life, willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love. In the midst of chaos, her new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly face the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Unlike De Palma's underrated thriller, "Doppelganger" is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills its purpose but also concludes in one of the worst endings in film history . While Barrymore is definitely not at her best, she manages to maintain her dignity with above-average performance. The rest of the cast, however, ranges from mediocre to painfully poor performances, although Leslie Hope can be among the best of them. <br /> <br /> The script is full of clich√©s and the influence of De Palma is quite obvious. While the film tries to be original, making literary references on almost every line, the dialogues are dull and the acting of wood certainly does no good. It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons, and excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects are made by the excellent KNB and are among the few good things in the movie. However, the bizarre overuse of the effects in the end totally out of context diminishes the impact of the work of the KNB and makes it tacky what in a different film would be surprising. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a B-Movie is no excuse for its low quality, since with a better and more coherent script, this could have been an interesting film. Unfortunately, all we have here is a mediocre movie that gets worse every second. Worthy for the beauty of Barrymore. 3/10
