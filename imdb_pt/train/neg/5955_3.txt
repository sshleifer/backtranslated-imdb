Using tons of films not only from Trader Horn but also the first two movies in the series (for example, the alligator fight was used last time), this is one of the weakest movies in the MGM series. It is a huge disappointment after the classic Tarzan and his companion, which is possibly the best film in the series. <br /> <br /> The plot has Jane's cousins ​​entering the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she will return to claim it. They are in the middle of the call since the relative who let the money cut them out of the will. Hiring a great white hunter, who secretly wants to capture Tarzan and sell him, the pair heads to the forest where they are faced with the usual problems in the jungle (more because of filming). After much conversation, Jane decides to return to civilization and we have long sequences of Tarzan and Jame making faces. Finally, in the last half hour, the plot to capture Tarzan is put into action and things finally become interesting, as the plans go awry and things look very gloomy for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Painfully dull film is clear evidence of problematic production. the film appears to have been assembled from several different films, with the first half hour being reproduced as an almost exact replay of the previous film. The middle third shows signs of having to stretch things and have plots that ended up not giving at all. The last third in which Tarzan is captured and the party endangered is the point at which the film finally comes to life (it also shows signs of graphic violence that caused much of the need to remake the film). For me it's a great wonder as the series managed to continue from here since this movie is not very good (except at the end). I would be hard pressed to explain except I would have to say it was the relationship between Weissmuller and O'Sullivan like Tarzan and Jane, who kept people coming back. It is a beautifully rendered pairing and is actually one of the great couples of screens. <br /> <br /> (I should probably also mention that this is the point where the film became less real and more fantastic with the appearance of the Tarzan tree. <br /> <br /> I really do not really like the first hour of this movie and consider it a If you can get in the end, I recommend that you try the movie, otherwise I would just skip the entire movie and move on to the next movie in the series.
