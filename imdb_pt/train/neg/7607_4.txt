- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife assumes up to and is determined to clean up the city. Not everyone in town, however, is happy with what she is doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in the city, the owner of the local bar (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. There's no way the hall owner knows the sheriff and the murderer would fall in love. <br /> <br /> - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a pretty interesting concept and it matches with a bad run. There's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a bigger budget, the Gunslinger could have been a fun look at the role of women in the Wild West. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many things wrong in the film: a cast of support with no ability to act, flamboyant and unnatural dialogue, and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would start with the actors (and horses, obviously) waiting for Corman to shout "Action." The best is the scene of two mounted knights standing next to a building. Suddenly they take off and come running around the corner as if they were riding hard for several miles. Or, take the example of people who apparently can travel around the city. We see a man entering a building and a second later emerge through the city to ride it. <br /> <br /> It's not as if Corman did not have some decent actors to work with. While none of them were big stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all capable of performing well. But in Gunslinger, they do not have much to work on. <br /> <br /> I have now seen the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would strongly recommend going the MST3K route.
