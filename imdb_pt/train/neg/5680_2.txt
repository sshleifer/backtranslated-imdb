If only the cruelty and death drawn had a purpose for the story to justify its inclusion, but the script was just unintelligible and simply stupid. <br /> <br /> It came to nothing, the story had no readable continuity. It was just a bunch of senseless snuff scenes and a very stupid ending nailed as if to say ... "the end * beep * you my enemies and my few defenders to watch my trash." <br /> <br /> I do not understand, a masked killer who has never had his mask removed in prison, a rape scene in prison that should be guards raping a terrible serial killer deformed and being killed by him and nothing more? no explanation, no punishment, a really weak main character that was a waste of an actor like Pare, who did not try to fool the guy who killed his cops, tortured a baby, a woman and a dog and sent them to you. To watch on video. Cops who for some unknown reason darted away alone (individually) in their farmhouse at night like a bunch of poorly written teen characters to be killed. Time like a bunch of idiots, and no other cop hears them die in the dark one after another and just keep wandering for no reason until each one is killed in turn. A bunch of horrible real-life scenes at first for no reason or explanation, he was reminiscing, he was watching to masturbate, it was a comedy for him ... what was it? Nope Boll just thought of throwing it to upset animal lovers .. whatever. <br /> <br /> Stop believing the word of a psychotic way to let your family go if it kills itself ... a more naive and stupid cop you've never seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I try not to totally hate their works. I try to find some reason to explain an art of horror writers, but these things ... sheer crap. <br /> <br /> Boll, what are you doing the most? I hope you find out because I know a lot of the most deserving people who can not dream of getting the budget you get again and again to make your movies. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Boll actually at his best check out "Postal" was really ok.
