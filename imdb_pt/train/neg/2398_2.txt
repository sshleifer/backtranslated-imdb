Being a fan of films like "Fire Sale", "Where's the Poppa", "Airplane" I saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the one mentioned above. Well, WRONG CONCLUSION! <br /> <br /> Not only is this not funny, it makes you angry because it's not bad in a nice way, but in a very bad way. It's so bad. The script does not contain a single funny line that gets in the way when you're trying to entertain your audience with humor. <br /> <br /> Adam Arkin's speech impediment is probably the most annoying thing in this movie. Still, this cruelty of nature does not prevent him from being presumptuous throughout the film and he has a hard time not looking at the camera. This amateur without charisma fits very well with the errors of constant continuity and fumbled throughout history - if you can find one. <br /> <br /> Ed McMahon - I had to think of Jay Leno, another late night talk show, who always refuses to call himself an actor. Well, I've seen some Leno movies and he's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Mars is good, though. In the few lines he gave. I'm not easily scared with bad comedies, so I kept watching and looking for all the jokes almost every 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie becomes a kind of comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over. - he literally does: Starting 75 minutes in the movie, he's in every scene. But it's too little, it's too late. <br /> <br /> When the movies try to make you believe that their lack of professionalism is the reason why you should like them because they have the right intentions, they remind me students that I did not prepare for an exam. In these cases you have to stay strict and the degree has to be an 'F'. (But, please do not assume that I am a teacher. This is a profession with respectability somewhere between politician and child molester). <br /> <br /> If you really look for a nice horror / scifi movie that is fun to watch and contains jokes try Bruce Campbell's "Man with the Screaming Brain." Or watch Sunshine / Core if you prefer a modern and noisy SciFi Schlock. Those are equally funny, though unintentionally.
