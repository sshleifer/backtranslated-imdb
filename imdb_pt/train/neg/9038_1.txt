This is a terrible production of Bartleby, though not, as the other critic put it because it is "not applicable", but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book. Tells the story, almost painfully. Watching, I could turn the pages of my book and follow up, which is not so much fun when dealing with an adaptation. Instead, see the 2001 version of Bartleby with Crispin Glover. This version, while good-humored, brings new details to the film, maintaining the spirit of the novel. The important thing is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like scenery, character names and costumes. The difference between these cinematic versions is day and night, tedious and hilarious. This version is a lesson about what can go wrong if an adaptation is treated inappropriately, painfully and maddening the mind.
