I just want to say that this production is very unilateral, it breaks the impartiality required if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits from the people they interviewed so you can not have an idea if they are worthy of being heard. <br /> <br /> Tell the story from just one point of view. Doing so is very dangerous because the next generation learns the bad idea, which is why wars keep coming. I know this is not the only reason for wars, but it does not help either. <br /> <br /> You can watch this documentary, but have read a lot on the internet before. The Balkans are complex as human history is.
