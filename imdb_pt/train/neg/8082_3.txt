It was one of those dawns "It's there" I saw things. Sometimes they are great. This was awful, but it really should not have been. <br /> <br /> The film had a very good cast. How can you fail when you have Charleston Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking about Oscar-winning territory here. Had good special effects. He still had some really good boobs! And I mean well-shown, full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver. But that did not make up for the missing ingredient - a story! The plot was ridiculous. I do not want to say the sun exploding "solar crisis", but that was already bad enough. It was the rest of things-the things of the evil corporation, so stupid and totally predictable. Man that just passed! No amount of good acting or legal spaceships or fighting scenes could get around this. <br /> <br /> I saw the same cast members to be incredibly good. I've seen wonderful science fiction films that had tiny castings and budgets. The whole difference is in writing.
