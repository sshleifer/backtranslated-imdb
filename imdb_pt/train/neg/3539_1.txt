Ritchie's first two films were fun and elegant. Here he invades two recent classics? 'The usual suspects' and 'fighting club'? and still leaves empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Despite parading like a con-mystery (with the sub-'Usual Suspects' babbling 'the biggest blow he ever managed to convince you that he was you' or whatever ...) and attempting a 'Fight Club' twist on which characters are real and which are internal manifestations, the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half. In the last third, you know you're being taken to a dead end, and tediously slow. <br /> <br /> Cons, chess and game theory are all great affairs, but Ritchie plunges them superficially and repetitively to make much use of the material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the (almost) watchable film is Ritchie's daring way with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera. If Ritchie got a more satisfying plot, and succumbed to a tighter edition, there's no reason why he did not make other enjoyable fun. <br /> <br /> As it is, Revolver is a waste of your time. Incomprehensibility does not mean depth. If you want to see a great movie that does not make logical sense but makes a virtue of it (and, incidentally, that also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement) watch 'Lost Highway'.
