Tense comedy, a sketch-type magazine that initially was a vehicle to display a radio star at once Jack Pearl, but is now more remembered as America's introduction to The Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe are hired alongside the comics Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. Although the supporting cast features Jimmy Durante (which is completely wasted on somber material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for the movie currently is Stooges addicts, and even they will not find much to applaud here. Incredibly noisy and arrogant, it shows just how far Hollywood needed to go to achieve a certain level of sophistication. * 1/2 of ****
