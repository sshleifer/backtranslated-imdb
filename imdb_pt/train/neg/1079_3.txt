I feel like I'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branagh's performance. He is a good actor for most of the reports, but he just could not get the southern accent out. I mean, it was deplorable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yankee. One of the previous reviewers questioned why American actors were not cast for this film. I mean this notion. It's wonderful when actors want to expand their horizons, but another thing is to try hard to make the performance tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's a great director ... Well, I really do not want to hit Branagh for his absolutely ghastly accent. Everyone deserves to screw up here and there. But it's hard to watch something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit in the Gingerbread Man.
