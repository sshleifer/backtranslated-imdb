I love horror movies, low budget, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's .. but how can anyone think this is a really good horror movie? let's compare it to similar home-made movie titles. the haunting, the changeling, the shine. or for a horror movie based on similar technology that was FAAAR's best (though still far from great) Demon Seed. Okay, I'll be fair ... let's compare this to horror movies made for TV! do not go to sleep .. more creepy and better done. Salem's apartment, the nightly stalker, the night gallery, not even going to the basement or crowhaven farm were much better. * SPOILERS * first, for a scene as good as the shower scene, you have a scene like the opening scene ... oh boy! the Garden Hose comes to life to clean some playful teens! TERRIBLE. also, just what we understand about the house .. she apparently needs to use her video cameras to see what's going on, and it's a very emotional house. not a spirit, or demon, or entity, is a house that is "possessed", but why? are we led to believe that an inanimate object learned to love suzie / margaret, our protagonist? now that I'm on the topic of suzie .. another scene that totally bothered me, this poor mad lady comes, says she was his nurse, pours her heart out, falls into the boiling pool, fighting in agony for 45 seconds and what margaret does? does she risk her hands being burned to save this poor old woman who came to warn her life? No, she stays there and watches! the acting was mostly better than average for a horror movie, but that's where the plus points end. by at least one more interesting and fun horror movie about an inanimate object that kills people watching the deathbed: the bed they eat. I get the feeling that people who have rated it so highly or have not watched it since it aired, or remembered to scare them as children. this movie was much less deserving.
