This may have been made to hell, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years, the best thing about the entire DVD would be the case! I'm surprised that people have taken the time to do something so crap and still spend money on it too, I'm glad I just rented it. I suppose the real fans of this movie would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to worry about without having any CGI or any other effect, I hope Alex Chandon has learned a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better movie in the future, that is, if he is still at work. <br /> <br /> Notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing, DO NOT BUY !!!!!
