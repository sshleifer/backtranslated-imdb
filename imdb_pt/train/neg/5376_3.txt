The CHOKE (aka AX in the UK) is a slasher supposedly produced as a direct movie for the DVD. I say "supposedly" because the title of the movie does not have the "V" in parentheses to indicate that it was made for a DVD movie (even if it looks like one). <br /> <br /> Is the plot simple? a band is doing a show in a former factory of refrigerators and they are killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most would agree that the film would never be a masterpiece, but that does not justify the flaws. On here. Even direct-to-DVD movies, such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating), have many redeeming qualities and sometimes look like one of the "bad" movies that are good. However, THE CHOKE is far from being a serious slasher (like HALLOWEEN) or being a "so bad is good" movie (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie starts off good with a dead character using a drill. The effects on the blood were very cheesy, but understandable given the very low budget. But from there, it's going down to the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many flaws in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But, some obvious stand out and I go for them. <br /> <br /> The show mentioned that the band keeps seeming to start with about 50 people present, but after the music stops, there seems to be only about 8 people left (and yet, all must be locked! ) <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not at all pleasant. Most of the band members are aggressive idiots or just plain weird. No one really cares what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they are dispatched. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meat factory as a kind of church (seriously!). He drops some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But unfortunately, not even his presence can save the film. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterization. About 65 minutes of the movie are spent watching characters walking around talking. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other direct-to-DVD movies, such as CROCODILO and WEEKEND, characters spend a lot of time cursing each other aggressively without any provocation. There are plenty of over-the-top blasts (mostly from the male characters) and one almost results in a full fight. In fact, it can be said that the format is as follows: the characters are out there - murder happens - the characters are out there - murder happens. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the word f being used. Maybe this was meant to be funny, but it looks sad. And, more precisely, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually with a much greater effect). <br /> <br /> The film is totally devoid of suspense. The corpses serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is running loose and yet the characters behave like total idiots. They make little attempt to leave the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves. And most of the time, they do not even pretend to be scared. In the same line as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time the murders are committed (with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen chasing the characters at any time. At DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this served to make the movie funny (unintentionally, of course), but here it's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> And as another reviewer pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras seem uncomfortable dancing. The score (in the end, there is no song in the beginning!) It consists of a band of aspiring Sugarbabe singing a very bad song that has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand points. this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). But it seems that CHOKE tried very hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into any of them. And even if the direct films for the DVD are released, this is a poor effort. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the film contains some pretty bloody murder scenes. But when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of the traditional slashers of the 1980s B movies should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH must do everything in their power to avoid it!
