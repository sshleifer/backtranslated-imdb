I ended up watching this whole movie (very long) because I was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivety of it. It seems hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would have voluntarily participated in this farce. But maybe in 1968 people really were so naive? The plot seems to have been written by some confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda. There is a superpower conflict and the Russians really are the good guys, with the Secretary General of the Communist Party being a good and spiritual man, who suddenly, after 20 years, sees the light and feels compelled to alleviate his bad conscience to the release a priest prisoner from a Siberian gulag. The priest then promptly becomes the Pope by a series of coincidences. We are allowed to see the Vatican's secret papal voting process, which is portrayed in the most omnipresent and pious way you can imagine. Meanwhile, communists in China have achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their countries. country to death. To solve this little hiccup on the ruthless path to communism, they want to start a nuclear war (in order to fairly distribute Western capitalist wealth to the working poor of China). <br /> <br /> Our good old comrade General Secretary gets a little worried and calls the Pope shortly before his coronation to ask him to broker peace. They meet with Chinese leader Peng, who looks and acts like a 15-year-old boy. You're going to roll on the floor laughing at what people in 1968 thought the Chinese looked like. Comrade Peng demands that Western capitalists pay (which is quite logical, after all, capitalists do not always have to pay for the madness of the Socialists?), And that the pope also has to sacrifice something for the common altruistic cause. equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> So when the pope is crowned in Rome he promises all the riches of the Catholic Church throughout the world to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. And so he saves the world from nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are also some minor subplots, which unfortunately provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie. I would give three Oscars out of stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn looks quite unlikely as a pope. He is much more plausible than Zorba, the Greek.
