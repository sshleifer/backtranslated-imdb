Alongside the horror films of the 1970s and 1980s, those about the undead were probably the second most popular subgenre of horror. While the horror films had 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' to make it all work, the zombie movies had George Romero's 'Dead' movies. And unsurprisingly shortly after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to make money. Many Italian directors were especially interested, like Lucio Fulci who brought us 'Zombie' a year after Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead'. , known as 'Zombie' in Italy and some other countries, and it was there that the film of Fulci became known as 'Zombie 2'. Besides the undead, it has nothing to do with Romero's movie, but it's a good movie by itself. It was a great success in Europe and nine years later a sequel was born. <br /> <br /> Pros: Lots of beautiful and lush landscape. Impressive score. The acting is not exactly good, but the cast is a game and seems to be enjoying the experience. After a slow start, the pace moves like that of an action movie. Enough cheese and unintentional hilarity for lovers of bad movies. Good work on makeup effects. So much blood and some decent blood. <br /> <br /> Cons: Virtually less plot. Nothing you have not seen before. Smashes some things out of the first 'Return of the Living Dead' films. Cardboard characters. It did not age very well due to the rock music of the 80's (not that I'm saying that all the rock of this period is bad), clothes and the overall feel of the movie. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: First of all, this is not a true sequel to Fulci's cult classic. In fact, I do not know if this was done to continue where the movie stopped. For those who do not know, Fulci fell ill during the production and ended up leaving and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei's films are quite laughable, but like this movie, many are a lot of fun. And that's all this movie really is, just something to watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (rating of So-bad-it's-good) 2/5 (Severe rating)
