When I read the back of the DVD box, I thought it looked very interesting ... so ... I put my mother in the stack of movies in the "4 for $ 20" section of Blockbuster. When we got home and got into the movie ... twenty minutes later, we found ourselves coming back to each other saying "that sucks. Let's put something else on." I'll admit, some of the talk from friends at the cafe made us smile a little. But let's at least get some decent actors! Every now and then in a movie, if the acting is bad and the movie is not going at a painfully slow pace and it really does seem interesting, I can screw it up and give a few laughs at how they are finished (or under) doing their lines. But I can only take a lot. Scenes of crying seemed like the actors were having hysterical laughter, there was no delivery for their speeches ... The amateur does not even come close to acting in that film. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has come here saying that this movie was good had to have been on some very good drugs while they were watching the movie. It's the tastiest thing I've ever had the displeasure of watching. DO NOT SEE OR BUY THIS MOVIE !!!!!
