Bonfire Bonkers is a movie drenched in sweat on the flop. I do not remember any movie that has tried so hard to be outrageous, provocative and important, but it has failed so consistently in every way. It's like a comic that is not getting laughter but can not leave the stage. The more the film tries, the louder every attempt to laugh will result in a resounding thud. The desperation that the film exhibits is so glaring that it almost arouses pity for all involved. <br /> <br /> The movie reaches the status of laughter only twice. Once in sight of Geraldo Rivera playing an obnoxious, arrogant and amoral TV tabloid journalist - which is funny just because he apparently does not realize he's playing alone. The other scene that deserves to be ridiculed is the final "big moment" of the film, in which the judge, played by Morgan Freeman, gives a talk on what morality is ("that's what his mother taught him!"). The pomp of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. <br /> <br /> However, it must be admitted that it is a noble endeavor. He has a good group of actors, if badly cast, who try to make characters with thin caricatures of cardboard. The film seems professionally done and the little cinematic flicks that director Brian DePalma loves are apparent, if not particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wants to be a commentary on modern morality and ethics, never rises above the level of cartoons. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even sitcom takes time. But the best the fires can muster is despair. In the end, you do not want to laugh, you just want to get away.
