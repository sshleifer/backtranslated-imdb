The longer this film took place - and it seemed tediously to go on forever - the more boring I became, frankly, the waste of time going through this total absurdity. How do people get to make movies like that, or do they get funding for that garbage? Do not be fooled by the relatively high IMDb ratings as this proves that you can fool some people all the time. And in this photo the main actors have an obsession for guns, so it's not difficult to figure out how the movie will unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it strange how society in the US has such an obscene and fatal weapons culture. <br /> <br /> Anyway: The lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl. He comes across a family with two spoiled children, a teenager and a boy; care for a strict single parent who can barely cope. The cowboy is seduced by the adolescent or vice versa, and the impressionable boy is apparently taken by the madness of the loser. <br /> <br /> The cowboy spends all his time in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser who prefers to go to the beach, then works to live, and then commits a robbery to his family because he is too lazy to make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to watch a sad and failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish, or really see a poor family that not much better than white trash?! <br /> <br /> This film is useless to Drivel. <br /> <br /> You only get the lowest possible score by listening to some music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
