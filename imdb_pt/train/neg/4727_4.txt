This film is really a kind of healing egg, good in parts. In contrast to other reviewers, I have found that the main flaw is the inability to attract the viewer's interest to the characters and the plot. I went through this because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of the bands, but if I were to evaluate purely based on its merit as a movie, I would have to give it up with a few caveats: Jason Behr is good at the part John Livien, and quite convincing as a rock singer; the narrative about his childhood trauma is not clear, although we are given hints of Livien's well-meaning relationship with his parents, but his behavior is ultimately bizarre to the viewer (which should not be). However, the idea of ​​using a stage persona to resolve internal conflicts is interesting, although it is not new or fully explored as the theme in this film. Allusions to John Lennon were annoying, but I confess I'm not a fan of The Beatles. Anyway, Livien and his band reminded me more of Oasis than the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derived about them. Another frustrating thing about the film was the way it opened up with some interesting philosophical reflections - albeit at the middle and intermediate levels - of the main character but left the threads of his thinking there, just to get them back in the middle of the movie very briefly, when Livien says, "Before God, there was music" (have I seen that ad for Aunt Mary in the 1990s, "Before the time, there was Aunt Mary?" That's what came to mind anyway) ; seems like a stupid conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he got there, but he's entitled to it. Luckily his bassist and friend, skillfully played by Dominic Monaghan, seems to recognize the fallacy of this thought when he replies "You do not know it." <br /> <br /> In all, the limited forces of direction and plot could go either way into future projects, useless banality or an interesting and more mature perspective.
