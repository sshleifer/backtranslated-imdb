I personally advise people to avoid this movie. Overall, it is very annoying to watch and the fight is poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD of this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is the audio commentary from Bey Logan. <br /> <br /> But anyway, since when there was a Ninja movie watching. I can not think of one and honestly I do not want to. <br /> <br /> Overall, when it comes to movies, I have a golden rule: Avoid any movie that contains the word 'Ninja'.
