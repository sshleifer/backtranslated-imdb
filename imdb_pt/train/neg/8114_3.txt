... mainly because Ju-on 2 has scandalous FORTY minutes of material literally taken straight from the first Ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes, this leaves you with original 36 minutes' worth of film. Ho-hum. I found this deeply annoying - as if spectators simply did not remember the same things! - not to mention annoying, having to watch everything again. <br /> <br /> OK, complaint aside, the signature of Ju-on 2 was that it should explain many of the unanswered questions of the first film, which, frankly, over the course of 36 minutes, simply does not go far enough to make any kind of highly complicated plotting sense of the original. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some really good horror sequences that show how good the film could have been if it had time to develop; and some of the issues raised by the original - some, but not all - are answered. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some additional developments in the story, go for it - but be sure to keep the remote control handy with your finger on the fast forward for forty minutes.
