** HERE ARE SPOILERS ** The government continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and may suffer more damage than before. However, government is dwindling, the project is in jeopardy and the supercomputer in the middle of everything feels threatened, so it takes steps to ensure its own security. It activates and controls the UniSols and begins to execute chaos. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This movie is about one thing. Choreographed fights. The story is bad and soon drowned in all the fights. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it's no fun watching a fight in which you know that a part of it is indestructible. Usually you are sure that the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fights between two fighters a bit alike. Not where someone is indestructible and can not lose. So fights end up becoming a tool to lengthen time. You wait until the final fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to defeat his unbeatable enemies. To further diminish my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much the half-naked women have. Well there are not really many of them because the characters are the majority of men (there is at least one UniSol woman though), but almost all women are unnecessarily shown with at least just a bra once. Women lead with this, but we also go through a strip club (to use a computer no less) with many more naked women. These moments give nothing to the story and are only there to try to please the male audience facing adolescence. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, boring fights. Neither more nor less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> 2/10
