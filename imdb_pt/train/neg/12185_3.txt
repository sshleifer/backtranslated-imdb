What has Martin Scorcese already done to remake this movie? And not only did he make amends, he ruined everything? The absurd decision to make the character portrayed by Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated performance, and that is to say a lot) in a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of Hollywood-held attitudes (and especially Scorcese) - attitudes that compel writers to think the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. Anyway, this movie sucks. <br /> <br />
