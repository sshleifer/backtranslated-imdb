I read the whole book 'A wrinkle in time' and saw the movie. The film contained all the elements of the book, but since the book had 190 pages and the film lasted 2 hours, it really was filled with too many effects and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin must unite to find Meg's father and leave the island, Camazotz. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is really bad. The acting is horrible, the direction is laughable and, so far, situations are not necessary. I really was devastated to see the same person Madeleine Engle who wrote the book and created the film, made a great book and a terrible movie. The acting is worse than any direct acting on the video. Yes, I have to admit there were legal effects. But seriously, they were all done terribly and not at all. If you read the book, it will be crushed by the movie. I wish I could give it a 0, but unfortunately I can only give it 1. A medium could have been useful.
