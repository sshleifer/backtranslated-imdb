In fact, these young people were so unpleasant that I could not expect them all to be slaughtered, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton), since I considered her the most boring of the group. <br /> But I knew it was going to be a mess in the early minutes when a teenage Christine opened the priest's shot and the nuns with the music of Leslie Gore playing in the background. He had nowhere to go but down. <br /> <br /> Even the prostheses looked fake and the "blood" looked suspicious like the Hawaiian Punch, although he later assumed a red day-to-day look to match the silly makeup of Halloween. they were all dressed. I'm sure all the GOTH idiots out there will appreciate this bullshit, as it will please this bunch. He certainly did not appeal to me. Blah ... <br /> <br /> And not even my darling favorite of terror, Adrienne Barbeau, can save this stupid teenage horror film from itself. It still looks hot, though. I'm glad she takes care of herself, since we can not see much of her nowadays. <br /> <br /> However, it's a step ahead of Dante Tomaselli's HORROR (2002), which has a somewhat coherent plot, so I'll give it a lot. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also raise the level. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end. It was the only good scene in a silly movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films certainly must have been desperate when they chose this one. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
