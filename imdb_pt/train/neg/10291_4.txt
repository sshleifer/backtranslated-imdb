80 minutes, and felt twice as long! Brief Crossing is not short enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes consist almost entirely of a dialogue (plus a monologue, actually) of a woman approaching middle age, tediously talking about "men", disappointment, sex, aging, and her recent breakup. teenager she met in the ship's cafeteria. <br /> <br /> The tedious monologue continues as they go to the duty-free shop, and to a bar, where at last their self-addressed speech pushes him away. The "story" can not end there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to her more drone as she takes him to her hut. <br /> <br /> What a little romance, sex or whatever, this movie has more than bitter speeches is hardly enough to justify the price of a rent unless you're one of those who love dramas where nothing of interesting happens. Yes, the ending is very well done, but it is a small reward to be subjected to what turns the living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic lament. <br /> <br /> Of course, some people like this. I could be wrong.
