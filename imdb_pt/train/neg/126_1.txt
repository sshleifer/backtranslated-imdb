"I'm Curious: Yellow" is a laughable and pretentious smoking pile. It does not matter what are the political views of each one, because this film can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the claim that male frontal nudity is an automatic NC-17, this is not true. I've seen movies rated male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting visions, but where are the R-rated movies with gaping vulvas and flapping lip? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same goes for those bad cable shows: swaying swings in the breeze, but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie films like The Brown Bunny, in which we are treated to Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson's website, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) "double standard" in nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account an inevitably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appear naked, and the same can not be said for a man. In fact, you generally do not see female genitalia in an American movie in anything less than pornography or explicit erotica. This alleged double standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to reach a cultural agreement with the interior of women's bodies.
