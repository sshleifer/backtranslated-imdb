Well, I have to say, this movie was so bad I would have left if I did not have to revise it for work. And the worst part is that I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over town, I paid $ 10 parking twice because the newspaper lists were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I saw him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. Either way, the plot has potential - it sounded great in the preview, but it's filled with weak, totally ridiculous, predictable plot-turning points. And I was hoping this would be a Christmas movie where Christmas would not have to be saved, and that Santa did not need a replacement, but no. The only cool part was the sleigh rides, and the little boy was the one. I'm sure this movie would be great for kids, but for adults it's so bad that it's a tough job.
