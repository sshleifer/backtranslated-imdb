When I first saw the show, the first few episodes looked promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the "mysterious" vampire stereotyped and Sookie introduced himself as an independent woman. However, the show went down from here and the once interesting characters are as much fun as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, the main characters lose their original personalities, along with their acting skills. In episode 5, Bill's frowns are so low that his face consists only of a forehead. Sookie, or rather the actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her and she only reacts to how nice it was to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep with each other very early on the show. The way they played with each other was something that left me hooked and could easily be played with a little more. As soon as Sookie loses, she turns like a total idiot, thinking only of Bill's libido and the size of his appendix. Bill also loses his attitude and well, he just gets silly. His actions are never really explained except that he does it for Sookie. Because? Their love for each other is never investigated, if there is love. So far it seems to be the sex that is the core of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires are usually of the same sex, but come on. Every five seconds, I see some sort of thing going on. It was no big surprise, as HBO always tries to move from a soft pornographic film like a decent TV show. Bill getting off the ground and just starting out with Sookie for no reason, what is it? I laughed so hard I almost peed. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. Characters never go into detail about anything. All events that happen are usually left unexplained. The only thing that is constant is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say that I like are the minor characters. Tara and her drunken mother are far more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I continue to watch the show is because of the development of the secondary characters. <br /> <br /> Except for sex and the main characters, the show would be worth more.
