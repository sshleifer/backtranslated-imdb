This is only related to the first movie by name. The plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks !!! I have no idea what they were thinking, but this movie is so bad. Avoid this at all costs, the first movie in the series is acceptable as a movie slasher and so is the bedroom, but this and the third one are rubbish !!
