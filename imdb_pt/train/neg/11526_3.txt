I liked the previous Ittenbach movie that I saw, "Burning Moon". But while the film was quite unpleasant and unpleasant, "Premiers" seems to be the main reason for laughter. While it is admirable how Ittenbach made this film without money in his spare time (and worth watching the documentary on DVD), I found myself constantly struggling not to advance to the next bloody scene. Of course, there's blood, and if that's all you want, go ahead and enjoy it. But be warned: there is an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious exposure of the story. Many are comparing this to the Peter Jackson films, especially "Braindead." But looking at what Jackson did with a similar budget in "Bad Taste," it is clear that Ittenbach does not have one thing that Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for very good and plentiful purposes, and for maximum limited resources - but not worth the money I paid for it)
