The cast of this film contains some of New Zealand's best actors, many of whom I've seen in fabulous roles, but this film fills me with deep shame just because I'm from the same country as them. Fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to become spectacularly wrong. As another comment a bit astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with some of the multi color flags stolen from a used car lot. Most of the cast seems to be from the (long) New Zealand novel, Shortland Street. It's as if this movie was dreamed up at a Christmas party on Shortland Street, the result of many gins and possibly a little salmonella. Imagine "Under Siege" meets "The Love Boat" staged by your local primary school and run by an autistic and you have the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I recommend you watch this movie as a study on how to destroy your caregiver.
