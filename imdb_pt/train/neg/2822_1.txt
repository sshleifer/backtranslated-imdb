OMG this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot I'm a film student. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need the money so badly? I love AJ and I've seen almost everything she's ever been, so I watched it two. It was SOO bad! not even evil, not bad. It had 1 or 2 funny little moments, but after all, it was a waste of 101 minutes. I can not even say that AJ looked good in this because she did not either. The plot is predictable unless you're expecting a recount of Romeo and Juliet, so it's not. All round disappointing. Maybe if your 12 this could be a good movie otherwise I really do not recommend.
