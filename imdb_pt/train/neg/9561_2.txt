Like many others commented before me here, I have to say that this movie is bad but not the worst I have ever seen. There will be no direct references to portions of movies or sequences in this review, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that I was watching an episode of a TV show or something, where they got some extras to spend on CGI (I saw worse of them) ... In all, it's a great insult to the viewer, at least if you have some knowledge about computers and / or technology at all. There are just so many of these insult moments to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself just begging for it to end - quick - halfway. In addition, there are numerous "easy exit" scenarios, which is also an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human ... <br /> <br /> This movie absolutely disappears compared to the old "War Games "and I think it's a shame they even called it sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars of me, because of one thing and one thing: the actors' performances are not kinda bad, considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work on. Still, they should never have signed this movie. It's not really a career change, but I think we all have bills to pay. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have given the movie soundtrack ... you have to be on the payroll of the studio or something, my only explanation. <br /> <br /> To all who have not seen this: by all means, observe it and decide. But lower your expectations to the ground (and then some).
