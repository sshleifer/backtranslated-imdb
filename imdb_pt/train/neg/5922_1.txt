My mother keeps a tape of this film as a general threat to anyone who loves movies and who irritates her. Everything about it stinks. <br /> <br /> As such, it's a true classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave you 10/10? Were you inadvertently watching a good movie and accidentally voted for it? <br /> <br /> Everyone involved in the filming process should be forced to watch at least a small part of this film. It must be an indelible stain on the minds of all those who keep the sacred film and be revered as the mark of the tide of filmmaking.
