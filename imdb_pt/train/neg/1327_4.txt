This terrible movie brings together all the Asian stereotypes you can imagine in a heinous package. With risky money, dishonest Japanese businessmen send the goofy Pat Morita to reclaim industrial secrets in Detroit. Here he meets Jay Leno, who promptly refers to a murder victim as a Japanese and calls Morita Tojo. It's all from there.
