Unless you are an evangelical Christian, then do as an Egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague. <br /> <br /> Horrible - why oh why the IMDb lists the most favorable reviews at the top of the list - it was due to one of these, I just wasted the end of what started as a good night in this applause. The premise of the plot began strong enough - I was drawn to the film and was interested to the point where the Bible sermons took over. What a waste. <br /> <br /> This movie made me so angry that I registered with IMDb for the first time just to complain - I hope that at least it saves someone else's night. /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian act on my part ;-)
