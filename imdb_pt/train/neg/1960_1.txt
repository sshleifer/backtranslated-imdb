I've tried to finish this movie three times but it sucks. Case in point: Mother and daughter go to bed and breakfast, mother stops to the gas, weirdest weirdo gasoline in her husband whose running B & B tries to rape her. She escapes, goes to B & B, and instead of her husband getting ballistic and wanting to call the police, the story continues with a lukewarm behavior on both sides. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other deficits in logic of action are plentiful. Acting is also lukewarm, and the neighbor's warning is delivered at a really tacky and misinterpreted moment. Moments of death / intense death intertwine unevenly with warm scenes of interaction between characters. Less focus on blood, more focus on humor and history would have been appreciated.
