Even though the book was not strictly accurate for the actual situation, it described that it still carried a Japanese feel. I find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had already been in Japan, since he did not feel Japanese or a little. Almost everything about it was terrible. I admit the actors were usually good, but they had no chance of saving him. Before the movie started, I was surprised that there were only ten people in the movie theater on a Friday night soon after the movie was opened in Japan. 30 minutes in I was amazed they stayed. I was like that, I would have the right to criticize him. The whole movie was punctuated my moans and suppressed laughter of disbelief from my Japanese girlfriend. Everyone I saw coming out of that movie theater had confused and disappointed looks on their faces. <br /> <br /> For the producers of this film, you owe me two hours.
