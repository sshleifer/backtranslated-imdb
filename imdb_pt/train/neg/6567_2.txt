I got into this movie hoping for the best. I like war musicals in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did good work with their roles; however, the writers gave them a boring dialogue. The love interest between the two did not receive any real growth; it was suddenly there. I did not think much of music; the best number was the one we heard from Spike Jones with "Der Fuhrer's Face". The only full number that Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy; Well-tamed things, even with the monkey. Bert Lahr's comedy sketches were endless. <br /> <br /> There were pieces to enjoy: Lucille Ball was quite smart, and there was a good selection of players who really deserved more time on the screen.
