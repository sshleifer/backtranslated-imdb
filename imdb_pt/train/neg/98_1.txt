I received this movie as a gift, I knew the DVD cover, this movie will be bad. After not watching it for over a year, I finally watch it. what a pathetic movie ??. <br /> <br /> I almost did not finish watching this bad movie, but it would be unfair of me to write a review without watching the full movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "this movie sucks" I'm really shocked that some bad filmmaker has even been funded to make this movie pathetic but it could not have cost more than $ 20 000 to produce this film. all you need is a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera. about 15 people without acting skills, a script written by a couple of drunken people. <br /> <br /> In the first part of this ultra bad move a reporter (Tara Woodley) ran a supposed drunk man on his way to report on a hunted city. He is completely unharmed. They went to a supposed to be abandoning the house, but fortunately for the furniture almost complete and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there. just for the supposed drunken man, but not everything is what it seems. <br /> <br /> So the supposed drunken man starts telling ghost stories / Tara zombies. <br /> <br /> The fist of your stupid Stories lame must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> His story. <br /> <br /> Sergeant. Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion (I guess that's what happens) after letting poor soldier Wilson sit down on the floor and let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapses, Ben Draper /> <br/> Bury you in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But the sergeant. Ben Draper is in for a big surprise. his wife / girlfriend knows this and she and her lover kill the sergeant. Ben Draper will take revenge on soldier Wilson (next to the tomb of the soldier he killed) The soldier wakes up from the tomb in the form of a zombie and kills them for revenge on him. <br /> <br /> The end of the twist was so bad. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, do not watch this movie
