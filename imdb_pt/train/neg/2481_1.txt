I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by this effort to write and direct, he should keep his job as a journeyman. Like many others here, I do not know how to categorize this film, it was not scary or scary, so it can not be called horror, the plot was so thin it can not be a drama, there was no suspense so it can not be a thriller, it's just a bad movie that you should only see if you were a fan of Blair's witch project. People who liked this movie used words like "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they were reading something that was not there. Like Blair's witch, people were scared because people thought they should be scared and believed it was terrifying. This movie really started well with the family "getting to know" the locals after hitting on a deer. It seemed to be a modern delivery, but then, for the next 45 minutes, (well over half of the film), nothing happened, the family packed their vacation home, which was very beautiful and elegant, but not a little fun. It was obvious that the locals would be involved somehow at some point, but Essendon clearly has no idea how to create suspense in a movie. Finally, when something happens, it is unclear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said that his liver was just grazing), and all along this wizard's mind apparently traces the apparent marksman in a very awkward way. with special effects of 3rd grade. The movie is called Wendigo, but no attempt is made to explain it clearly, the film ends up confusing and makes you very dissatisfied, I would have bailed out 15 minutes to go, but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. This did not happened.
