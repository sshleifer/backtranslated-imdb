Naming the utterly more pathetic crap in film history is not an easy task, as the candidates are so plentiful, but the Nemesis 2 has been my favorite ever since I saw it. It was so funny that we had to rent it again the next day, and again I laughed so hard that it was literally rolling on the floor. (This usually only happens when I see Monty Python's "Scott of the Antarctic.") Throughout the film, an overpowering feeling that grips the viewer. I'm completely confused that this awkward domestic video has reached the production stage. It's supposed to be a sequel, but has no apparent connection to the first film. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is female, although we took half of the movie to stop guessing, with all the muscles and clothes nomad-barbarian! <br /> <br /> It really is not a plot, it's just a protracted chase scene, but it's so slow and meaningless that calling it a chase scene makes it look a lot more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue, which is so good considering his quality, and then the movie suddenly comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gas explosions, without ever really explaining what it was. Fortunately, it never gets boring because there is something silly and phony happening all the time! <br /> <br /> Terrible movies are usually just tedious, but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect blend of over-seriousness and total unintentional folly. which is truly fun. Rent this movie, or buy it yet, you will not be disappointed!
