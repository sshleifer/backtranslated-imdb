I rarely witnessed a waste of such free talent. There is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a movie. The few interesting strands that the movie seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than fake leads. Actors of stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are employed in roles that lead to nothing; an occasional genius director produces a film that appears to be filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens; a writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of sub-motivated incoherence. The film has a cheap and lusty feel about it - but almost at the level of the comments - it's really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I come to IMDb to write balanced and generally thankful comments. This blatant disaster of a film only makes me want to produce an infinite and bilious speech. I will not, but only because I no longer want to occupy my "mind" with this garbage.
