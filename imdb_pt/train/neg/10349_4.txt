First of all, I'm a big fan of Madeleine L'Engle and I was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This film, however, ruined this emotion for me. I'm sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having effervescent curls and glasses and as being considered very cold. In the film, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the "sport type" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle imagined Meg would be. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and showed the way she felt when she was young. This is just one of the key examples of how the book and the film are different. So, I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it, but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and his Wrinkle in Time series, I suggest skipping this movie.
