Yes, Marie Dresler drinks plum juice that she thinks is poison and runs off. <br /> <br /> Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea, but she is a solid artist who surely holds the screen. <br /> <br /> I watched this for Polly Moran, whom I saw somewhere else. Here, Moran is OK - just OK - as Dressler's crusty friend / foe. Too bad she sank into almost total oblivion. <br /> <br /> The plot is good at heart. The thugs try to rob people of the city. Dressler succeeds and everything ends well. <br /> <br /> I wonder about the central mechanism of the plot: titles. This happened during the Depression, so maybe everyone was familiar with bonuses and what they could do if they were well used and misused. I, however, not from that time, am vaguely familiar with them. They are just different actions, right? It seems strange to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity.
