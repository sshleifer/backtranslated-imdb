This movie sucked. Bad everything. Why do we, who love western movies, stay nine times ten times when we rent the west? It seems that if you do not see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck on the cover, it's not worth tinkering with. For the most part, the main action of Shiloh Falls occurred in 1892, but the revolvers used were models of the 1860s. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene, the marshal fired his six shots nine times and failed to hit none of the three big men who were only twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of that inanity. Maybe those who participated in this movie could have some classes at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
