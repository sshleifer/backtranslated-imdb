Unconsciously, I had this movie on my shelf for a while in a Mill Creek collection, and one night I decided to watch it; although do not expect too much. As the initial credits approach, I am surprised to discover that this film was made under the company Filmirage. Filmirage brought to the world incredible sparks like "Troll 2", "Actor the Invincible" and "Quest for the Mighty Sword", so I was compelled to watch. <br /> <br /> As the movie began, potential to be quite decent, although not original. The bloody scenes could have been improved if they were extended and more frequent. But after a while in the movie, the rhythm started to drag on and I found myself thinking "Okay, someone better be dead soon," or "Someone better mutate." At the beginning of this tragedy, when I was having these thoughts, although one may have been killed or mutated, as noted, the blood and effects were not very good. What made things worse was that the transitions in the scene were confusing; Example: First Dr. Houseman would be at the zoo, so he would have a glimpse of possibly killing someone, eventually he would wake up sweating cold on the bed - causing the audience to ask "Was he dreaming that the zoo was?". Like the rhythm of the movie, these scene transitions have progressively worsened. <br /> <br /> I could try to say that the development of the character of Dr. Houseman was very good, but at the end of the film, that is, once you saw what the Doctor has metamorphosed, I hope you laugh - which, in fact, is the only reason to see this movie at least once; This movie unintentionally works like a long joke. <br /> <br /> The costume of the thing that Dr. Houseman becomes can also be seen in Joe D 'Amato's "Quest for the Mighty Sword," which was made the same year. You have to love Filmirage movies, they are always reusing the same things!
