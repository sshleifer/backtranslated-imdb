Where is Michael Caine when you need it? I've seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-season 1 (episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, face the worst batch of all-time cinematography, delivering lines that must have been written by a secret work group of Dick Cheney consisting of Exxon and GM lawyers trying cut funds for mass. research in transit and energy efficiency. It looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly in Super 8. It makes Logan's Run look like the Sistine Chapel of the cinema crossed with Shakespeare. I can not imagine myself watching without the commentary on Crow and Servant, since it is unattainable even with this. Clearly, what is needed in Hollywood is kind of a 401K, which prevents the need for actors to bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care. With the theme "rights to pollute and direct", in the end, I'm kind of expecting to see a Charlton Heston show where he makes his "dead hands" speech. Lee, I could have forgiven you for this in 1989, but in 1981?
