This movie raises several pressing issues in my mind. First of all, how did Jennifer Tilly sustain a career as a movie actor for all those years based on that ridiculously loud, shrill voice and the limited range of facial expressions she employs? Secondly ... what the hell were the people responsible for making this movie offensive and deeply repulsive? And thirdly ... since there were enough perverted people to decide to do this thing, should not there be someone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or any place - healthy enough to prevent it from actually being completed and released? . You really would have to look for a long, very long way to appear in another film as profoundly unpleasant as this ... and it's not even rated as a horror movie - that as far as it can be seen as pertaining to any movie lawful. genre of film, certainly is. The movie wallows from start to finish in the most sickly kind of madness, violence and abuse, and essentially has no redeeming features. I'm not really advocating censorship (which I do not believe) ... but I really can not see how anyone could draw anything positive by watching a movie like this.
