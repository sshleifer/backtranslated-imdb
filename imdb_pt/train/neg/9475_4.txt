Beautifully photographed and skillfully acted, usually, but writing is very sloppy. There are such unbelievable scenes that there is no joy in watching. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for example, is so invented that I grunted out loud. And the "connection of the bulbs of emotion" also seems a trick. <br /> <br /> I do not know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something beautiful to see with some comic and flaccid scenes, this is a very good movie. No great effort on the part of the spectator required. But Italian cinema, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than that.
