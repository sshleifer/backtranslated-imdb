This is one of those movies where I wish I had stayed at the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is downright boring. What story there is is very fragile and you pretty much have to guess. The film engages in pretentious camera techniques that seem to cause migraines and look like a student movie. Did I say it was already annoying? If all the characters had died suddenly at the end of the movie, I would not have cared less, since I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but it was about that. This is the first time I ever considered leaving a movie theater during a presentation, but I kept believing I had to improve. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie you could threaten with mischievous children.
