I've seen all four movies in this series. Each one moves further and further from the books. This is the worst yet. My problem is that he does not follow the book to which he is entitled in some way! The directors and producers should have named anything other than "The Blessed Joy of Love." The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). Children's names / ages / gender are wrong. The whole plot is not where in the book. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great disservice to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a film under her title that is not correct at all. The music is too loud. The actors are not convincing - they have no emotions. <br /> <br /> If you want a good family movie, this can happen. It is clean. Do not watch, though, if you are waiting for a condensed version of the book. I hope this is the last film in this series, but I doubt it. If there are more films made, I would like Michael Landon, Jr and others to get closer to the original plot and story lines. The books are excellent and if followed closely, they would make great films!
