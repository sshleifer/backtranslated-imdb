This is a terrible remake of a marginal but well-liked movie from the early 70's. I've seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20 minute 'packed' movie in 2 hours or whatever the runtime. Cheesy plot, which by the way, is completely different from the original. The government's greatest involvement was exaggerated. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In the original you could go get a beer or go to the bathroom and still keep up. It took only a few hours to change the oil sump of the car. It takes much more than that in real life. Car guys notice these things. In addition, the fools or idiots who chose to destroy a 1968 Charger and abuse a 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel with a baleful bullet. The fact that they are not "people by car" is painfully obvious, and their death will not be saddened. <br /> <br /> The actors had no emotion, everything was cut and dry. One step above a monotonous one. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but certainly not least, the radio DJ made the statement that the Challenger hit the bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). This is total crap. Can you say aerodynamics, or lack thereof? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this.
