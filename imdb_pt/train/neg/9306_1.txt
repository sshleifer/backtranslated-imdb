This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I've ever seen. To begin with, I would like to say that the cover of this movie is misleading, if you think you are about to see a really scary horror movie with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact, the face of the killers does not even resemble the front cover a bit, it's just an image they must have found on Google and found it cool. Speaking of things they found and found cool, there is a scene in this movie where some gang members are looking for their friend in the old grove, and suddenly the screen cuts to a scene where there is a mother deer feeding his youth in a glow of light solar ... I mean seriously WTF ??? How is this relevant to the dark woods that they are wandering? I bought this movie from a man in a market hoping it would be fun, if it was not horror, at least it would be funny right? WRONG! The next day, I gave my co-worker getting rid of the plague called S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> The result is: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!
