This starts badly, what happens to the three women acting like high school silly sitting laughing with their gin, endless cigarettes and a sweet caramel chocolate for who tells the best story of "man", and then it gets worse - = - spoiler alert = - = with Andie's character falling in love with the young organ player who used to be his student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not) just to have him destroyed thanks to his bitch Of infernal 'girlfriend'. ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organist's love son and the 3 women end up like they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character plays the caramel chocolates on the street in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
