I must say that during my childhood I am very proud of many of the films that I have rented. The exception is Theodore Rex. Talk about the all-time movie about any actor's resume. Can you imagine what the fired Whoopie agent must have told her to sign that crap? Hey Whoop, you've seen this Dinosaur show, yeah, they're making a movie with it, and you can see Germany! "After that, this agent must have mentioned Star Wars a lot. This movie was so bad I figured Whoopie must have bought all the copies of this movie and have it destroyed.I just wanted her I've done the same thing in my memory, because my sister still gives me a crap for watching that movie. I mean, let's face it, I've seen Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in theaters (good reasons why I gave up both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for a while), but this stands out in my head as the worst of my childhood, and the biggest rent regret of my life, and that was 16 years ago.I am 24 years old now if you want to do the math. <br /> Whenever I think of my list of the worst movies of all time I do not even mention this, because as a step-boy raped, I try to suppress that it has happened. <br /> <br /> Fuck whoopie, just be happy that people only recognize Eddie and Sister Act 2 as the worst of your luck.
