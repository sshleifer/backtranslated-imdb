It is interesting how 90% of high-rated reviews are all made up of the "United States' random" * user name (without state pride) that all say more or less the same thing with the same grammatical style and everything with same complete lack of taste in the movies. I would delve further into this suspicious trend, but unfortunately this is a review of the movie, not the comments themselves. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a true avid movie. fan. That means I've seen a lot of movies, from good to bad, and I can honestly say that Facing the Giants is not, in fact, a good movie. He has good intentions, but fails to meet the many (if any) basic standards that I associate with a quality movie experience. <br /> <br /> Performance: mostly terrible, palatable at best. To hear that the majority was seemingly voluntary does not surprise me at all. <br /> <br /> Dialogue: clumsy, tacky, script sounds like a long version of some weird piece you'd see in Sunday School or in youth. group function. The rave review robots reveal the absence of "meaningless words," but the hard, cold truth is that such words are a part of the real world, and their complete absence is palpable. Let's just say that the head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have a lot more to say than "OH NO!" When things are not going your way. <br /> <br /> The plot: incomprehensibly predictable. It was commented that this movie "is not a Hollywood clich√©", and yet it is as it was taken directly from Making Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including the almost romantic subplot required for women) and only had a Christian theme A layer of paint hit her I'm not lying or bragging when I say that I had almost every important detail, both in the plot and in the subframe, tied immediately to its beginning. Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their entire lives would be emotionally stimulated by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> The Direction / Edition: It was also standardized almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports. Movie model. Still, acting sideways, there were not many perceptible errors, so at least Facing the Giants was technically competent. <br /> <br /> The Message: Ask Jesus and He will grant all your desires. Part of me hoped that this movie would end the eventual defeat of the team to really emphasize the whole "If we lose, we praise you" because in the Real World, you WILL fail at one point or another and it's good to be prepared for it. But in the world of Facing the Giants, if you fail, clearly someone has spoiled everything or is cheating. Another interesting question is, what if the Eagles came across another team that had obtained religion? Would they be caught in an endless cycle of miraculous moves and last-minute rescues, or would the universe have simply exploded? The Bottom Line: For the hardcore conservative Christian fathers crowd mourning the ills of Hollywood, facing the giants will be another mediocre-in-best Christian film to be held on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern making a movie. To everyone else, the effects range from boredom to the burning desire to be watching something else. And a warning: Any attempt to show this to non-Christians will lead not to conversion but to derision. I give these two stars, one for the scene that did not make me roll my eyes and another for basic technical proficiency with a low budget.
