I've seen (a lot) many movies of this company - this is about the middle of the pack. One is the good side, it's a bit more stylized and controlled than some of its tastes - minus the attempts at humor and more adherence to the story (so it's worth it). Many of her titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateur sensibility. On the other hand, I found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of his other films (like Vixens Vampire, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae is always a 10 in the peter metro, as is Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce hot in a middle school-marm, and Ruby LaRocca a sexy hottie. <br /> <br /> Watch this with the remote control firmly in your hand (free) on a night when you need a break from pornography. Do not waste your time wanting to check out the story - you have better things to do with your life. It's not a movie, it's pure T & A, but it's not bad by that standard.
