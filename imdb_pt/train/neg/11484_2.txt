Is it just me or is that kid really boring? Sister Hideos, spends most of the time chasing after the little disobedient like that and so on. As for him, well, I know he's a kid, but his acting ability is as wood as a dead tree. So far I'm just halfway there, and I'm fascinated by history, but people, let it down, I just hope it gets better to the end, since I can not even know what it's all about. Although some supposedly enigmatic messages in the scrawls on the wall and a notebook indicate that everything is behind, ie Dog is God, Living is Evil etc ... seems only a bit obvious at the moment, but no one mentions its obvious meaning, Still, anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I'll update this post, but if you're reading this, then well ...... See the above statement.
