Interesting? Difficultly. The 'scientific evidence' that the film provides for its point (which is basically that the Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost laughable (if we did not know what happened back then). <br /> /> Important? Nah I can not imagine Germans (even in that horrible moment) who would like or believe in this movie. Compare with Triumf des Willens by Riefenstahl. Now that was the movie that impressed me. This is just silly rubbish. 'Best' part is an M scene (one of my all-time favorites), where (the Jew as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child -molester and killer . In the eyes of these filmmakers, only a depraved mind can do it. Uh-huh I did not know that M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just STUPID. Even for the genre of Nazi propaganda. 2/10
