I think it's possible that I've seen worse movies, but this is a real stinker! the plot is normal, but that's not the worst. the direction is not near what you would expect from ching. He is able to do a good job but could not make the film together. <br /> <br /> Angie Harmon, portraying the female lead as a reporter insisting on who is behind the president's assassination, actually failed in the role. There was no chemistry with kindness, her behavior was flat and wooden, and the 5-inch heels she wore throughout the film were absurd. this output to harmon places it solidly at the bottom of list "b". <br /> <br /> And what was Cuba gooding thinking ??? He has to his credit a number of outstanding performances, but this was far below what we expect of him. <br /> <br /> Poor James Woods and Burt Reynolds. poor.
