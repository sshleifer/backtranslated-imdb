I could not bear to sit around the movie. Families like this really exist somewhere? There have been many comments describing this family as similar to LLBean models and such, and I think this is a great description of how they behaved. Most absurdly unbelievable writing / acting occurs when we find a character. referred to in high school as "pigface" who, of course, became a beautiful Harvard-educated plastic surgeon at the age of 20 (but only to do good in the world - not for money), and she lies down Carrel on the first date . It's when I stop watching ... <br /> <br /> If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then maybe you'll enjoy this sentimental and self-indulgent waste of time.
