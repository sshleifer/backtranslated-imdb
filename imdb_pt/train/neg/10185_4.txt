As early as 1967, a certain director had no idea about a galaxy, far or near. He was trying to complete a movie with the title THX etc. This short is a remanufactured story of a certain George. I'm sorry I only have cuteness to defend you. This is just an advertising promotion for the director, actors, et. al. It has little intrinsic artistic value. It's a brochure. The lead playing George, is very good, as well as the character Leia and the character ersatz Darth. Everything else is pure commercial junk. What a waste. Still, the work was done, I think. The rest of the movie is just stepping on the water to kill time, I guess. just a brochure.
