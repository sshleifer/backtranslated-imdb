GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / The Netherlands 2005). Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who discovers that her husband (Fedja van Huet) is cheating on her, but she does not dare to face him. She avoids painfully any confrontation with humans, her parents and her sister, so we have a main character in a movie that does not do much. We barely know anything about your past or your motivations. Only a woman who seems to be stuck in a dead end, not just during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well? <br /> <br /> I almost gave up the movie after seeing this unacceptable mess. These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. I usually try to avoid wasting energy on bad movies. I'll take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case a fair warning is in effect. How did Nanouk Leopold obtain funding (largely from publicly funded funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak. It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematic ideas or a cast with a little more appeal. None, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view." The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a woman's perspective on life. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, there is an interesting shot to be found throughout the film. I can not think of a cast that could have tempered this, but Johanna having Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this extreme lack of material. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we're going to film you for three minutes, just express sadness." A perfect cure for insomnia. Take a copy and watch it late at night, also guaranteed for you to sleep. Camera Obscura --- 1/10
