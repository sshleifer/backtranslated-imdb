If you are a fan of really bad movies, and you think it's funny, you'll get the great performance of Shaq. First, putting professional players in movies almost never works. Shaq had to be the worst actor I've ever seen alongside Dennis Rodman, who also made some bad movies. Well, anyway this movie is also bad because of the hideous kid. I'd give a zero, but that's impossible.
