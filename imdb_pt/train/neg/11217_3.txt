So the wife and I just finished, despite the various threats from the two of us to turn it off. Most of the time, boredom was the worst part of this movie, there was only a little excitement. The acting was atrocious, to the point that we actually laughed several times during some of the worst scenes (the church lady, for example). The dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin, though instead of sending in useful information, she concentrated on trying to scare her into her place, which looked a lot like The Ring. Instead, involve the police - which I'm sure the ear plugs she found would have DNA on them - instead, she plans a horrible plan to "catch" the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister. I call it a horrible plan, because in the end she allows him to kill her too, which the film then darkens. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad ending.
