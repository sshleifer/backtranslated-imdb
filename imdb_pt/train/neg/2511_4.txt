Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this well-meaning but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau) trying to trap his scientific niece (Ryan) with the common guy Tim Robbins to make her relax and enjoy life in the 50's. To make Ryan like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the film falls headlong with tacky situations and silly dialogues. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan and the fantastic supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat but are unable to rescue the movie. It is unfortunate that so much talent has been to produce such a mediocre film. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are big fans of Meg Ryan.
