This movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time. I usually like the kind of cheap horror movie, but this movie was a disappointment. The main fault is the lack of explanation of the creatures. When they entered the house and found the man he could have, they explained. He does not really say anything about them unless they killed their parents, and unless I missed something, he did not say how he managed to escape ... Not to mention the fact that he gives no clue or reason why only the survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after their own near-death experience. It seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the "cross incident".
