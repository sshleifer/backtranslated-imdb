I've seen many stupid scenarios in my time, but this is one of the worst. After getting some disease in space, an astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. He then goes on a riot, killing people (as he is beyond me; I just watch them, I can not explain them.) This is the kind of movie that should not have been done in the first place.
