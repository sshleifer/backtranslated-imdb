If there is an inferno, it contains a projection room in which GRAND CANYON is playing repeatedly in an eternal loop. It would be expected that the presence of so many wonderful actors-Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, and Mary Louise Parker-would help offset the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose penance is watching her own films for eternity). . But not. Apparently they injected these other actors with a serum made from McDonnell. The whole affair is pretentious, exaggerated, insulting (if you are deaf or know someone who is, be prepared for your blood boils in the ridiculous TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is full of detestable and self-centered people, but it never gives us a reason to like / understand / sympathize with them or even tolerate them. With rare exceptions, they are unbearable losers that the gene pool would be best without. There's no plot to speak, no character development (these people will never develop), no break-out performance, and the most archival writing you'll ever find in a movie. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? Your Headline. This is a big hole in a movie.
