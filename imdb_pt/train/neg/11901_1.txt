"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a tombstone for the career of director of German director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many have felt this in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes perfectly clear; Wenders not only lost that, but also became a director of the BAD, creating terribly fragile and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> It can be argued that the "time you lose" comes to every director, but Wenders's case is extreme. It's like he completely forgot everything he knew about movies and started over - just to get sloppy results. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this movie does not deserve its time.
