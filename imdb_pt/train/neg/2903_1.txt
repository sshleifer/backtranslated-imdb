Oh gosh. This movie could have been under-titled "When writers go on strike!" How stinky. I had high hopes for that, especially after reading IMDb reviews, which makes me think about the entire IMDb rating system, but that's a separate issue. I loved Steve Carrell at Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc., so I was expecting great things. To say I was disappointed is the euphemism of the year. There are so many things wrong with this movie, but will I limit myself to (a) the implausibility of ANY family behaving like these people do (a mass aerobics workout? On what planet is that real life?), The awkward script Please, and the fact that Dan's character is so unpleasant, you wonder what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? This movie was filled with a clumsy dialogue, a direction ranger, ridiculous scenarios and was slow, slow and slow. We would have left after half an hour if we were not with my parents, who do not go out much and do not like to waste money. Unlike the creators of this movie, who would have been better off playing all the money spent making this movie on a bonfire - that would have been more fun. If you like movies, avoid it like the plague.
