This is only crushed because it stars David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me hit her. Compared to the garbage they call the horror that comes out nowadays, this movie is not so bad. There's the beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot, but can not speak very well. There is a great scene with her when she is raped supernaturally. She shows off her beautiful body. Linda Blair does nothing here like Hasselhoff. 3/10
