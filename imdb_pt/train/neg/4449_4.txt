"Sleeping With the Enemy" is a predictable, "before him" suspense that seems to never find inspiration, no matter how desperately the cast and crew try. I can not believe that a lot of my friends have convinced me to see this in the movies some sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The complete lack of originality of Ronald Bass's script (based on the novel by Nancy Price) does not help, either the obsolete direction of Joseph Ruben or the very middle performance of Julia Roberts. The supporting cast, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, little help. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say. Just make a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
