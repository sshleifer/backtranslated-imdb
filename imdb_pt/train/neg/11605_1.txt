At first glance from the plot slogan, I realized that it could have been a decent movie. Could I be more wrong? The beginning of the movie makes it seem like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget movie. During the first 10 minutes you do not notice the tacky effect, the horrible sound and the horrible special effects, but then it gets worse. Only about 20 minutes I was wondering, "What was the plot again?" I could only ask that question when I was not laughing at the sheer lameness of this movie. The lead actor has a scene for the emotions, and he keeps it all through the movie, even though he should go through love and hatred and everything in between. The flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me relive an extra minute of footage from the beginning of the movie. Now we come to the middle of the movie where they're obviously trying to steal Morpheus from "The Matrix," even though he's doing a horrible job. The actor is talking about "Star Wars" and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable. Now at the end of the movie, you do not realize that it's the end of the movie because you really think the plot is finally developing. The character "Morpheus" dies, the ONLY good thing about the movie. He utters a few words and credits roll. What is it? No plot, bad acting, all cheese, could not get worse. Please, if you value human decency, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
