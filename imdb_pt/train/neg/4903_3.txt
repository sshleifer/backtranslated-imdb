I am never a big fan of Taiwanese film production, as opposed to Korean, Hong Kong or even China. The strong acting quality is hardly found in them, as clearly shown in this film. I do not consider myself as difficult to please as I am, actually a fan of indie films. However, this movie shows a weak plot and a slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle of where the plot is going. The performance certainly does not improve. Rainie's acting is sub-par as she's 'over-act', trying to be lighthearted and cute. Although I have to admit that it is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role as a confused, sad, remorseful and extremely reserved character. Overall, I think this movie is a disappointment.
