Every movie from the thirties is dated, but if you watched John Ford movies it would seem more old-fashioned than if you watched others. that is, the Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there is always the heavy sale of someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always the overemphasis of evil of some weight. Always the poorly crafted, clumsy and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a pretty elaborate device to deliver feelings. And feeling is all that means. <br /> <br /> What Ford does here does not make me like Lincoln, it only makes me wonder how the states were colonized by the population of complete idiots described here. . Ford started making decent movies. This is too old to be anything but bad. It seems totally false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. And no one from Illinois would pronounce the "S" or say "Shonuff!"
