This movie was seriously horrible. The acting was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super extravagant, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. At first I thought to myself, well, it's an old movie. So I remembered that this is no excuse! I've seen older movies with better performance and such. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really busy. The editing was bad (most of the dialogue was out of sync). <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie does not even deserve a 1. I just watched because I was so bored, and the movie hardly amused. me. It was laughable. My dead grandmother's left pink finger could make a better movie than that.
