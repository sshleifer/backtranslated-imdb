Seriously, what were they thinking? Over the years, the series Columbo has experienced some new things and deviated from the usual formula of success, but this film really exaggerates. This film is basically very different from any other Columbus movie, but the differences are not for the good of the movie. Main thing that of course makes this movie unlike any other Columbus movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed. The whole premise of this film is totally different and puts the character Columbo in a totally different environment and situation. In addition, the global is just totally different and more "modernized". <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi has made some other Columbus films in the past, which fit the usual formula. It is also a strange choice that he has been chosen to direct this film. The character Columbo himself also feels quite different perhaps because of the reason why he is put in a totally different environment and situation when he helps his nephew after his fiancee disappeared shortly after the wedding . The lack of a good sense of relief and Columbo's mood mark also does not do just that a nice or nice watch. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, the film does not get too bad, but the movie begins to become more and more ridiculous with its story as it progresses. It's a stupid suspense of kidnapping written with a story that begins to become increasingly unlikely. This also makes the film increasingly unattainable. This is a very small entrance from Columbo that also does not know entertain the spectators in any way. <br /> <br /> It also does not help much that the supporting actors are not the most talented around. . Despite the fact that his character is put in a totally different situation and the film is filmed in a completely different style, Peter Falk still holds up well and his presence still saves this movie a little. Can you imagine how this movie would be without it? It would have been an extremely bad and ridiculed and cheap film that I can tell you. <br /> <br /> A strange entrance from Columbus, which could be described as a failed experiment to deviate from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
