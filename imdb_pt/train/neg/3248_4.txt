Why did I go to see this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he made hilarious movies that made me cry with laughter, so you really blame me for waiting for it again? In addition, the premise, the funny trailer, the involvement of his co-star Jennifer Aniston, and the fact that it was a big hit in the United States encouraged me. <br /> <br /> However, as my "one-line summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For many reasons; Reason 1: It was not funny. In a 2 hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking "I really should have an ice cream". I admit it may be wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what he really expects when he does Gem as' The Truman Show ',' Liar ',' Me, Myself and Irene ',' Mute and Dumber Movies ',' The Mask 'and' Ace Ventura 'produce, in the very words of Bruce Nolan, such a mediocre movie? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally underwritten. I mean, hello! She's been around the public's eye for about ten years, and in this movie she gets about four lines to say. Wrong. Reason 3: One word - Clich√© <br /> <br /> Reason 4: A casual unfolding of specifically American references - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'sweeps week' - is a clue to the appeal specifically developed for the cinema. "A teenager says no to drugs but an education - that's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!" God tells Bruce, a heavy-handed feeling that seems to have fallen in the United States, but may face stronger resistance in markets that hold a hint of subtlety. Besides, I'm still going to school, and this statement suggests that me and all my friends are miracles ... or maybe it just means we have brains? <br /> <br /> In this movie there are funny moments from Carrey to make you laugh and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but it is advisable that you start to review your expectations down.
