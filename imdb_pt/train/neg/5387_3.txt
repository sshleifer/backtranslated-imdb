In an instant, when it seemed to be getting interesting, he never got there. <br /> <br /> People are going from one point to another, with no point (if there was one, it was very annoying). There was no action, suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless, so there was no care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> All together, the film was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I give you a 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like that it was not unstable camera work and if there was music, it did not bother me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrible. .
