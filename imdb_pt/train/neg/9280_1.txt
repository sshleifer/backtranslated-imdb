Honestly, I do not know what's funny, that horrible remake, or the comments of this forum. The critique of the masterpiece has left me in tears, this is so funny. Anyway, this movie is one of the worst movies of all time, and certainly the bottom of the barrel of sequels. The name "Omen" in the title made me stop and watch this morning on HBO, but it's a slap in the face for the other three, especially the original. There are so many classically bad times, but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic show !! good times ! This movie is for the Omen series that "Scary Movie" is for the whole genre. Avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh.
