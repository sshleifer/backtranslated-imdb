I actually saw China O'Brien II before seeing the original China O'Brien. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = funnier! And funnier = better. If you're a bad movie fan like I am, that's great stuff. If, however, you are looking for any kind of significant plot, acting ability or ability to make movies, it is best to avoid this. The best part is how they filmed all the struggling sequences in fast stuttering. Hilariously bad. Watch for a laugh, watch for irrational amusement, but whatever you do, watch for free on the TV.
