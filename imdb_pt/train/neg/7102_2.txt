Okay, I admit I watched this movie at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I'm a big fan of), but I'm not one of those people who automatically give a rating of 1/10 for the MST3K movie. Although I hate many of the movies they play, and some are among the worst movies I've ever seen, I actually got to enjoy some MST3K movies. That said, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (It's no wonder, in fact, that the MST3K writers themselves commented that this was one of the worst.) Do not believe me? Check out their website.) <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is A Good example of what NOT to do in the movies. The dialogue is very bad, the acting is worse, the cinematography is pathetic, the direction (although perhaps the best thing in this film) is bad. <br /> <br /> Rhythm is the worst part of this movie. Sometimes in this movie, the viewer had to wait for literally minutes for something to happen. Although the minutes may not sound like a very long period, they may be in a movie, especially in this one. I'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but I was very bored. It really looked like ten minutes. If "suspension of disbelief" means "almost falling asleep during a movie," then that has a lot of it. But THE SCREAMING SKULL is just so horrible, I could not possibly have been interested in anything that was really happening in the movie, and so the "suspension of disbelief" was in fact non-existent. <br /> One of the worst and probably the most annoying movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
