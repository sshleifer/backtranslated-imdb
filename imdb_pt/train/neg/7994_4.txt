A pretty useless for the television movie that follows the script of killer insects. The ants mysteriously transform themselves into killer ants near a hotel. I think it's from the hotel's food because the hotel's kitchen drain drains directly into the bed of ants. There is a lack of suspense in this movie and it is not scary either. Seeing a lot of ants stinging their victims is not very terrifying. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Section The hero's stupidity is almost incredible. He is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. It has to be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says this, the hero picks up his tractor and destroys the immense colony of ants. This disturbs the millions of ants and arrests people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> End of spoilers Overall, this movie is extremely lame. I do not understand why you have a DVD release when so many deserving movies have none. My only guess at the release of the DVD is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the film. This is a movie to avoid.
