Listening to how hilarious this movie is, I finally rented it at the store and for 75 minutes maybe I have laughed 3 times. This film, a collection of skits that make fun of television is an incoherent mess. Jokes crumble, humor deals with issues from the 1970s that simply are no longer relevant, and the jokes continue for a long time (almost like the new jokes). SNL forgets the past years). Yeah, Chevy Chase's on it, but it might be 1 or 2 minutes. I liked the fact that this was very cheeky and had nudity in abundance, but could not it be funny? Do yourself a favor and rent Kentucky Fried Movie, which is a much superior film made in the UK.
