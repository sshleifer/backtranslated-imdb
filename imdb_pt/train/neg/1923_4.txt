It's ironic that Dr. Seuss's fable, emphasizing non-marketing of Christmas, is one of the hottest, most marketable and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The overall essence of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's curse against Christmas stems from a childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season except for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This film makes an ardent and ambitious attempt to capture the madness and the feeling of the story of Seuss, but the final result is a film that gives a beating and never packs the emotional impact of the animated version of Chuck Jones. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but be it the dialogue, the rhythm or the strange stories about the initial plot, the transformation of the bitter miser into joyful benefactor simply does not inflame convincingly. There are some wonderful visuals and the makeup work is incredible, but beyond the technical triumphs there are one or two elements here that are missing. <br /> <br /> Succinctness? <br /> Soul? <BR> <br /> Or maybe Jones made the initial adaptation very well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of a movie that seems to be three hours long. Howard, Carey and crew are all very capable and talented but what appears to be a winning combination is only weak and slow in their final product. If you need to see the full-size version of the feature, rent it in a video with the animated version of Jones and you can see how much bigger and brighter it is not always better. I give this movie three Who-Hash cans of five.
