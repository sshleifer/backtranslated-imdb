Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst movies ever made by mankind. The film, one of the many films about people with disabilities that emerged after Black's phenomenal success, ridicules fraught fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of people with disabilities. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a disabled woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperate-type monkeys who have no scruples about being disabled and repressing half the world to protect their love interests. The music of Anu Malik is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is losing his balls quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty maidens in distress having nightmarish moments in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the desperate ones mentioned above. Boman Irani, like the villain Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the film if possible.
