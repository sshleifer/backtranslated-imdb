The "Curiosities" page on IMDb claims that the filmmakers protested that this film was re-cut by the studio to "simplify the plot." If so, this effort was a total failure, as this is one of the most incoherent narratives I have ever seen in a movie - I would hate to have seen it before the plot was "simplified." <br /> <br /> It is sad to see Warren with so little character to continue that nor can he do anything with the inept material. It's interesting to see Caron in the 70s mode instead of her glamorous costume and persona in the Hollywood style, but it's sad to see her wandering slowly by that fate of husband doing a favor to his producer. In fact, she would later marry and marry the director, instead - who, you will notice, never directed anything new, but strictly first or second A.D. TV work from now on. That should tell you enough right there. <br /> <br /> I call this "interesting" because I have an automatic predilection for American films of that period, and that role adds perspective to Oates' 1971 departure, which would otherwise be fantastic. - Lane Blacktop, The Hired Hand). But the "1940s detective like fish out of water in the 1970s." The theme, which is the only thing the movie really has to say, is sold in a very heavy way. A similar theme would be treated more effectively two years later in Altman's The Good Goodbye. And to the extent that Oates plays a tough guy in a doomed job, three years later, he would give his final performance in Alfred Garcia's Bring Me the Head. If you have not seen it yet, do not waste your time on this!
