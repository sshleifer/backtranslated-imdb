* May contain spoilers * I leaned back to be fair with this movie. I knew you starred in Madonna. I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters. I knew I had a lot of bad reviews. I was not expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class, culture and sexuality as we entered the original Italian. The benefit of the doubt lasted ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays a rich, pretentious and eccentric Gorgon who goes on vacation with her husband and irreverent friends (the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, displaying some really idiotic facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first companion of the ship that the Madonna character delights in being humiliating and treating like dirt in all the scenes that they have together. Why is she so fucking him? Simply because the plot demands that later, when the two become isolated on a deserted island in the Mediterranean, the tables will be turned and he will teach him a lesson. So inexplicable is they fall in love, though they have nothing in common and have abused each other for two-thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> "Swept Away" is a silly, simplistic and superficial film, from beginning to end. end. Madonna gives a typical wood performance. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna singing and dancing atrocious with Giannini's demand, a fantasy scene with Madonna and many scenes in which he hits her and kicks her in the butt. Guy Ritchie makes his "fashionable" edition that is laughable here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard in a big movie in several years. The ending is sentimental and implausible. It's basically "The Blue Lagoon" meets "Overboard" minus the first nudity and the latter's sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Maybe Madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress. Please give up, Madge, for our sake and yours. This is not her worst movie. This distinction still belongs to the "Shanghai Surprise". She did nothing worse than that ... yet.
