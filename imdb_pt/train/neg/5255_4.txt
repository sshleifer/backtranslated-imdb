Visually speaking, this movie is awesome. It has some delicious black comical moments. But overall, the plot is very clich√©, as is its apparent message. If you are a fan of exaggerated violence in conventional films like hostel or saw, you will love it. If you are looking for something at all, drive away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh Film Festival, 06, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it is not disturbing. Just creaking and nasty to sit on. If you really want to be challenged, go see something like The Lost. If you want to be insulted, or tell your friends about a really confusing movie, then this is for you.
