A vampire henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar hooker in this extremely low budget horror comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments about this movie. I'll attribute the mass hallucination, but it's disconcerting, though. The only redeeming factor (and this is me being extremely generous here) may be the Grandfather who is the only semi-sympathetic character in this whole mess. Do not waste your money or time. Actually, here's a word of advice, if Troma puts it on DVD, but it's not done, in all probability it sucks. <br /> <br /> Troma DVD Extras: Commentary with Omar and Kirk; second comment with cast and crew deleted scenes; bloopers; interactivity; radiological gait; "Terror Firmer" clip; Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for "Rowdy Girls", "Teenage Catgirls in the Heat", "Cannible: The Musical" and "Toxic Avenger 4" <br /> <br /> My Note: D
