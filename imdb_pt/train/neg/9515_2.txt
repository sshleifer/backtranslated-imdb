OK, I watched the original French version. But I can not imagine it being better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that this is the most annoying movie I've seen in a long time. There are almost no redeeming qualities for this movie. That's why I can not understand all the positive reviews. It may be realistic in a sense, but some real stories are best left unsaid. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow-paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow, but allows introspection and sets the mood of the movie, for example. But in this case, the film is just filled with unconscious dialogues that can tell us little about the characters. None of which I could identify or care for. In many scenes I found myself thinking, "When will they shut up?" The acting was very bad. Not in an obvious way. But it seems that none of the actors cared about their characters and they all seemed to want to be somewhere else in most scenes. This may be due to the uninspired dialogue they received. In addition, the whole flow of the film seemed quite mechanical. Going from one scene to another. It seems that this movie has just been written (badly) but never directed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that I can say that did not generate emotional response from any of the scenes. Without suspense, without fear, without anticipation, without sadness, without introspection, without intellectual stimulation, without interest than ever. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what I call an anti-film.
