I have to admit that when I went to see this movie, I really did not have high expectations. But even with my low expectations, I was totally and utterly disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Luke Wilson is a hot guy who usually hang out with crazy girlfriends. There's a slight mention of a girl chasing him, but that's very cute for this character. Which I do not care about, because it would probably be as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> So while on the subway, Rainn Wilson (which I really liked before this movie) convinces him to talk to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. This is strange to say the least, as everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong to the category of "hot." <br /> <br /> Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from being "hot." Usually I'm all for his acting, but even he could not save that movie. His character was nervous, unreal and quite annoying. You could never tell if the writers were trying to make him gay, or just desperate. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> But anyway, someone steals her purse as she gets off the subway, and Luke Wilson is the lovely savior he runs after the thief. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero, or "G-Girl", as they like to call her in the movie. It still puzzles me about what the "G" stands for, but let's leave it to the discussion forums to debate. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I assume should be funny, but I find myself wondering who has sex like that? They almost throw the bed across the wall because of Uma Thurman's "passion", shall we say. It makes my head ache, but not in "I'm thinking too hard to understand this" mode. When One insults Anna Faris, calling her a "prostitute," I had no debate about it. Apart from the fact that she can not choose movies properly, she can not act and relies on the fact that she is blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> Overall I would have left the theater if I did not pay $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let you know that just because you shake your head a lot does not mean you're acting. <br /> <br /> In addition, the script and story could have used a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid. I actually began to feel ashamed of the actors and their dying careers. Overall, if you value your money and your self respect, do not waste your time on this pathetic attempt at a movie.
