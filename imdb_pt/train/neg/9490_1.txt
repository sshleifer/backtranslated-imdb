This is complete and absolute trash, a good example of what a BAD movie is, this can not be attractive to anyone, not even to movie buffs b. Do not repeat, do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of junk. Bad acting, bad direction, horrible script (but I mean really horrible) and complete lack of an idea about what entertainment (anyway) is. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning would not be enough for what this movie did for me. I like b movies, the murderous toys, the strange monsters in the pond, but that's not even close. Do you know those movies that are so bad they are funny? Not even. Simply pathetic old man.
