This movie started well, I felt like I was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Too quickly I began to question the situations and actions of the main characters, and found no answers as to why they were doing what they were doing. The whole performance was superb, but only a few scenes had brief moments when they were really funny. Dan Cortese was incredible. I loved him in that role. Your agent must show this movie to cast agents. Watch the first scenes and then find something better, or else you'll be totally lost in this mess. I found this in a bin at a video store. It cost me two dollars and, due to the rarity of this film, I feel it was a good price.
