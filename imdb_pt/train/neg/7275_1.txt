"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever, surpassing even the foolish "Plan 9 from Outer Space". The film Lampoon unfolds in three separate and disconnected vignettes, each with different artists. The only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site said fleeting nudity shots are good, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry show their assets beautifully in Part One and Part Two, respectively. But their glamorous displays are, unfortunately, wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a reliable story to surround it, and there is no one in sight. <br /> <br /> The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the conclusion of this film. Benson plays a young police officer who is eager to appear on his first day of work, ready to rid the streets of evil. He is paired with an old cynical cop interpreted by Widmark, and when these oil and water partners made their first patrol together, we felt a possible redemption from the earlier failures of the film. Perhaps, just perhaps, the cynical veteran is reformed by the strong sense of duty and loyalty of his new partner. Maybe everything will be happy after all. But unfortunately, this movie goes straight to the bathroom, no redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon go to the movies," I thought I had seen the worst problem that Hollywood could have. Unfortunately, I had not seen half of that. <br /> <br />
