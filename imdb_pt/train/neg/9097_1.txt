Who really created this crap is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's a waste of time and money. I hate how they create low-budget sequels with D-Lister actors and a plot so much like the first. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in the trash next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99 I was a fool to think that this could be good, instead I watched with disgust like poor stereotypes ripped from the plot and the first script. <br /> <br /> Who thought that the video production was actually a half decent movie you should be on the crackd or something because I think most people who watched this movie think THAT LOAD OF CRAP !
