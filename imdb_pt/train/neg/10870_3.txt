Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before inheriting $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women as Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) to accompany him and ensure that he did not fall into disgrace with prospectors. One such lady Cleo (Geneva Mitchell) appears on the scene to disapprove of women. We follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their accompanying role they agreed to perform for the 3 months that Bill is in New York while Bill meets up with Cleo and another woman. In the end, love is in the air for Bill and another ............. <br /> <br /> Image quality and sound quality are bad in this movie. The story is interspersed with musical numbers, but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not good either. He is quite nice, but only comes alive when he plays drums or trombone. There is a very annoying character who plays a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the film is just plain annoying.
