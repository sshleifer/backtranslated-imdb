Even though the storyline was very well detailed, and the story line was understandable, the fact that Steven Seagals' voice was dubbed with most of the film was distressing because you were not sure who you were talking about. There were many parts in which he began to speak in his husky and deep voice and then in the next voice of another person was speaking for him. I do not know the reason, however, if he had difficulty with his voice during the production of the film, I think they could have topped the events that did not contain his own voice when he recovered. I rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the movie. When someone pays for a movie, whether it's in the movies or on DVD, this movie was not worth the entry price that was charged. I have been a follower of Steven Seagal for a long time and all his movies he has done over the last few years. To this day I think this is one of the worst we have seen
