This Germany from 1919 to 1933 looks little like a World War II capitol in the Czech Republic. Oh, sorry, it's the Czech capital and it's 2003, how funny. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most terrible history films of the near past. Röhm is a head taller than Adolf and looks so good, Göring is 40 when he is only 23 and the "Führer" always seems to be 56 years old. And the buildings, people, and even buildings are young at times. Especially in 1919 were many houses in Germany almost new (WWI does not reach German cities!). Not crumbling plaster! Then the Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban canyons around this building, ever. And that may sound like a miracle to all of you: in 1933 the Greater Berlin fire brigade has many vehicles with engines, some even with turntable ladders, but none with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> last thing: what kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this in the final sequence? For me, this was a kind of "Adolf Adventures in Wonderland"
