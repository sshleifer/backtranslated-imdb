My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror / sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends to laugh. We saw this on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say that this movie is horrible, I'm talking about a good way. All about it, acting, camera work, story, costumes, is so cheeky and low budget, but that's what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors seemed to be walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this movie was not serious when they did it, because if they were then that would be simply sad. If you like watching really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them, then I highly recommend this.
