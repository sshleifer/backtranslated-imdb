A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment "A woman's life is no more valuable than that of a man." <br /> <br /> This politically correct mantra is not true like history as well as biology show. Societies managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with surprising speed. Germany was ready to wage another war in 1939, despite the war between 1914 and 1918, in which more than two million of its men were killed. In the War of the Triple Alliance of South America (1865), Paraguay conquered three neighboring countries until virtually all of its male population was exterminated, but fought to an impasse in the Chaco War in 1932 against a much larger Bolivia. <br /> <br /> No society, however, managed to survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake, are women sent to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but has since never considered combat units for its Defense Force, despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier. <br /> <br /> "G.I.Jane" is a Hollywood buzz.
