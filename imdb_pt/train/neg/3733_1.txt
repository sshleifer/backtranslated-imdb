Weak, old, tired, clich√©; wants to be Basic Instinct, but loses opportunity after opportunity for new perspectives, new insights. Tasteless, banal, grotesque and without the possibly redeeming value of brevity; oh, wait ... it was only 90 minutes long ... should have just * seemed * much longer! I'd rather clean the toilets of the bus station with my toothbrush than having to go through it again. I'm expressing an opinion here: I think that means I did not like it.
