The "To Die For" box deceived me - a handsome guy with no shirt on and the promise of some laughter and sex. There was enough Thomas Arklie (Simon), who is easy on the eyes, but without laughter and little sensuality. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, are supposed to be together for several years, but no character is interesting. enough to worry about, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. The fault seems to be in the script, not in the performances; both actors do the best they can with what they get. <br /> <br /> The ending is sentimental and non-affective (well, not totally affective, I felt relieved to be finished). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a gay and AIDS movie that is funny, Parting Glances is so much better.
