Without the actual indulgence of the supernatural or the poetic nuances that motivate humankind, all that this creative team must expect is the effective use of its medium and non-original elements. 'Festa dos Cinco', which has become manic, then genetically inescapable, there is little interest in the fact that the singular non-homicidal element is a rather bland second-rate mopester of 'Wes Bentley'. In fact, the whole performance is superficial. Even if dark-haired women appeal, lasciviousness is kept to a minimum. No nudity here. Also lacking enough buckets of blood. All sensations are kept at a safe and risky distance ... an unfortunate fact, given the name given to the directors, is "butcher." Only the soundtrack, the alternate buzz of the alternative country, and the tense floating point provide any palpable tension. Sometimes some static storyboard compositions add attractive low angles that increase discomfort ... but for a movie called horror, I did not even come close to shrinking once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on social rejuvenation through ingestion of blood, scenes directed at varied geometric forms outside the square, and a sustained focus on playfulness through family malice or traps that sympathetic characters need to escape to escape their dilemma would improve my opinion, but this was not a good start for my excursion through horrorfest.
