This movie was made for the TV to stink all this. However, it began with great intentions, featuring large sets of looks and props and authentic costumes. The film quickly degenerated into horrible dialogue in the nose cheese, and hastened the TV to sentimental melodramatic acting. The characters were so honeyed that sometimes I thought they were about to degenerate into a bubbling puddle of goo, and the action was so complicated and badly cut that it looked like the soldiers were just standing and taking turns shooting at each other. . The Germans were so unrealistic that it was painful to watch. The only thing the German officials said was how wonderful Americans are. Please take my word for it. I'm a big fan of the war genre, and this movie sucks. However, this DVD has a great extra feature, covering letters from the front lines of World War I, making this rental not a total waste of my time.
