Michael, a five-year-old, sees his mother killed by his father serial killer "The Highwayman," who later commits suicide. "20 years later," Mike (Gordon Currie of PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to his isolated grandparents to "master their own fears" at a Halloween costume party. Morty, a life-size wooden puppet kept in the attic by the Indian all-man, is possessed by the spirit of his dead father and kills them using his phobias. Characters are thrown out of a window, drowned in a toilet bowl, eaten by rats, exploded, etc. Morty turns into a father and a tree, walks around and makes foolish antics. After finding a girl cut up and stuffed into a cardboard box, the characters remain in the house, act happily, make jokes, and have sex. <br /> <br /> Morty's drawing is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees from the original Friday THE 13TH) is surprisingly charming as the grandmother, but this thing is even more meaningless and confusing than the original and filled with frightful scares, malicious characters, brain-dead, repetition of flashback footage, and annoying distorted camera. In addition, the only two minority characters (the Indian and a half-black girl) are the first to die. Blah!
