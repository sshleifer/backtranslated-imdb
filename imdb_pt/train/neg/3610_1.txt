A patient escapes from a psychiatric hospital, killing one of their keepers and then a college professor after he goes to local college. In the next semester, the replacement of the late professor and a new group of students will have to deal with a new batch of murders. The dialogue is so clich√© that it's hard to believe I was able to predict lines in quotation marks. This is one of those cheap movies that were played together in the middle of the 80s era slasher. Despite killing heroin, this is just trash below standard. Horrible acting, horrible plot, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible !! "Splatter University" is just thick to put on your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest watching your tape head cleaner, it would be more fun. Jump and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. Ranked as R for Graphic Violence, Profanity, Brief Nudity, and Sexual Situations.
