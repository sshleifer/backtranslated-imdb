Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and produced by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now, with this mix of great talent, you would think this movie would have been a real party. That could not be further from that. The massacre falls straight into his face as being one of the most boring horror movies I've seen coming out of Italian cinema. I was really struggling to stay awake during the movie and never had this problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> The massacre begins with a prostitute being slaughtered at the side of the road with an ax. This scene was used at Fulci's Nightmare Concert. This is not a bad scene and it raises expectations that the film is an ax. Unfortuanitly, the next hour of the movie is so annoying. The film follows a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes, but the characters in the film are so boring and unsettled that their interest begins to leak. The last 30 minutes of the movie are not so bad, but could still have been much better. The blood in the film was pathetic, and since Fulci wore most of the bloody scenes at Nightmare Concert, there was nothing new here. The end of the movie left a good turnaround, but still lacked a lot without answer and continuity falls straight to the ground. <br /> <br /> This was not a very good movie, but for a real Italian horror freak (like me) this movie is mandatory because it is very rare. 4/10 stars
