Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to drive. Maybe she should go back to acting ... at the second thought she was a bad actress for. Who would put money to produce something so bad? I like anti-Christ movies and I usually have a good laugh and the strange scare, but this is just Bad Bad Bad. The acting of the stars was worse than what you find in a novel. The special effects, if you can call them that, are laughable. I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion, you would see the tubes from which the blood shoots. We had to turn off the disc after only 30 minutes. The so-called original prints of films must be destroyed, all discs and tapes must be destroyed and everyone associated with the film's production must return the money to the people who rented the film. So these people should never be allowed to act, direct or film anything beyond their own home movies.
