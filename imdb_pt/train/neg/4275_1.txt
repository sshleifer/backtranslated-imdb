I can not understand why so many people praised this show. Twin Peaks is one of the most annoying titles I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen all the episodes of Season 1, and I watched the Season 2 episode 1. I just can not watch this show anymore. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is appropriate induction in criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> In Season 1, there was a scene where Agent Cooper throws rocks into a bottle. Can you guess why he did it? He only wants to identify the killer by making this 'joke' as he mentions the supernatural ability given by the dream of Tibet. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are many unnecessary scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, Season 2 began with a "funny" scene that an old idiot serves Agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper is lying on the floor (he already has the gun in his belly). This old man is not doing anything but saying some stupid comments. That is all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 sec .... It's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I would read some comics instead of seeing this show more .
