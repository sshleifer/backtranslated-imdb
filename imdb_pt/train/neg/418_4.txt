One might wish that an idea as good as the "invisible man" would work better and be treated more carefully in the era of fantastic special effects, but that is not the case. The story, the characters, and finally the last 20 minutes of the film are as fresh as a mad scientist movie from the early 1950s. There are some great moments, mainly due to the incredible special effects and the very idea of ​​an invisible man stalking The streets. But unfortunately, we're back to the tight confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic. <br /> <br /> There have been many remakes of the old. movies or TV shows in the last 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it's becoming clearer for every movie that the idea of ​​putting classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is pretty bad. It is obvious that money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script are far enough away, and as a result, "Hollow Man" is seriously hampered by clichés, sentimental characters, predictability and lack of depth. However, the only thing that really impressed me, other than the special effects, was the oath. In making this kind of film, modern producers are very interested in letting children see them. Therefore, language (and sometimes violence and sex) is very attenuated. When the whole world explodes, the good guys say "Oh damn!" and "Oh my God." Hollow Man discards with gratitude this kind of hypocrisy and the characters have the freedom to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural response to something that went wrong is to swear - but that makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swear. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
