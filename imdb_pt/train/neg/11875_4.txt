Mmm, a big pile of pancakes does not look good? Maple syrup and canned fruit on top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm Take another bite. Other. Other. EAT. EAT this, you !!! Keep digging your throat until your face turns green with nausea. You just went through the experience of Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon this show in the winter of '98 and got hooked instantly. Like that pile of pancakes, I choked on it. But the pleasure soon disappeared, because the character Ally McBeal (who we see being cute and lovable at first sight) soon becomes the most annoying, insecure and tearful you've ever known. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my female to take the column.) The play and tricks of the show also become banal, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which is really pushed into his face) becomes annoying, and the incessant character Changes and rewrites make the show a fucking novel. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is to take this show in small doses, and leave as soon as it becomes uncomfortable (and it will happen). I did this for 2.5 seasons before my pleasure was totally soured. It was good while it lasted, but as a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend, she was ugly after being overrated. <br /> <br /> And the next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Ask for something healthy like the fruit cup. It will get a lot better with you.
