Is it to be presumed that those who praised this film ("the greatest opera ever filmed," did not read somewhere?) Either do not call the opera, do not call Wagner, or care about nothing except his desire to appear Cultured. Whether as a representation of Wagner's Swan Song, or as a film, this strikes me as an absolute disaster, with a heavy reading of the score combined with a tragic and lugubrious realization of the text. <br /> <br /> It is questionable whether people with ideas about what an opera (or indeed a play, especially a play by Shakespeare) is "about" should be allowed anywhere near a theater or movie studio ; Syberberg, very elegantly, but without the slightest justification of Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is "about" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the latter stages, transmutes into a kind of beatnik baby, although a who continues to sing high tenor - few, if any of the actors in the movie are the singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the maestro, who is seen as the face (but not heard as the voice) of Amfortas, and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a sort of Batonzilla or Maestro Que Comeu Monsalvat during the performance of Good Friday's music - in which, by the way, the transcendental beauty of nature is represented by a dispersion of worn and flaccid crocuses trapped in bad mood turf, a dossier that leaves me stumped. In the theater we sometimes have to undo these imperfections with our thoughts, but I can not imagine why Syberberg could not fit into Parsifal and Gurnemanz mountainous pastures as lush as those provided by Julie Andrews in Sound of Music. Sound is hard to bear, loud voices and trumpets in particular have a aural glow that adds another kind of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspiring conductive and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another magazine mentioned the recording of Bayreuth in 1951, and Knappertsbusch, though his time was very slow, had what was missing from Jordan, a sense of pulsation, a feeling for the ebb and flow of music - and, after half a century , the orchestral sound of that set, in modern presses, is still superior to this film.
