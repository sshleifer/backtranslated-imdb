As a director of Altman's experience, he could expect us to spend time or worry about what's going on, a leading character who's neurotic, a whiner, an idiot with no redeeming qualities-that's the central puzzle about it. deeply confused piece of work. A monstrous piece of crap. In addition to this disabling failure, the plot requires a serious concentration to be followed. The setting in which the character Branagh enters is so obvious from the start that we are inclined to wonder if the writer and the director have totally lost respect for the public. This last question lies at the heart of the film: it represents the self-indulgence of the direction with deep contempt for the taste, values ​​and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
