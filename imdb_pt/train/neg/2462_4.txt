Well, I like the blood in this movie - it's really disturbing. Anyone who has gone to the dentist will know why. The story is not really that bad, the motivations of Corbin Bersen's character make a lot more sense than in most horror films. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse acts, direction, script, etc. the day this is still a bad horror movie. So it comes down to whether you like that kind of thing or not. I tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly the same thing as this movie. Just keep in mind if you like people being tortured at the dentist, then this is the movie for you!
