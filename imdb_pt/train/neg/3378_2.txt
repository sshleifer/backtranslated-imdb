When the movie was released, I had seen the Chorus Line on the stage 4 times, and was eagerly anticipating the production there is a lot of rumors of a movie in history. My wife and I were in the queue hours before the box office opened on the day the movie was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. <br /> <br /> First, the story was "moved out", so to speak, including scenes that are not within the confines of the theater. These boundaries are a big part of the meaning and impact of the story. <br /> <br /> Second and third together (assign your own request): one of the original songs, with a very dynamic dance number, has been removed; a song that was not in the stage production was added. Say what ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the artists. I've seen the Chorus Line on stage 6 times, and I would not mind seeing it 6 more times before I die. It's superbly written, with wonderful songs and truly harrowing stories. If you want to see a musical that includes a great "call of cattle" audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, check it out on the stage.
