Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute wrote a definitive, 120-page, line-by-line refutation of this lying movie that was to be titled A CONVENIENT LIE. The address of the website where your debunking report, which is titled "SKEPTIC'S GUIDE TO AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH," can be found at www.cei.org.

As James "The Amazing" Randi does to mediums, and Philip Klass makes UFOs, and Gerald Posner does the conspiracy theories of JFK, so does Mario Lewis with the Al Gore film and all the "global warming" fraud.
