I have not finished the movie yet. You may say that in this case I have no right to revise it, especially in such a negative way. But I do, just because I stopped because I could not watch anymore ... I got in the way, and I just got there promising me that something good was going around the corner. This movie is so tiring, so dull that I was really insulted. I have not read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teenagers who have suffered from it, but I am homosexual, and I went through "similar" revelations, daydreams, issues etc. etc. There were maybe two moments when I I really felt that this movie could go somewhere where I felt I could have some hint of meaning or relativity but those hopes were thwarted the moment the next set of cliché narration came. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you can not hear erratic playback, nor does the echo disappear if you just read the quotes because they are too painful / ridiculous / stupid to be missed. I gave the film three stars, and all three stars went to the director of film photography who did a fantastic job trying to turn Archer's tired "concepts" into something watchable. You see, I pray he's not the only one who has decided to include all TV plans for close-ups ... another unnecessary cliché ever made in movies like Korine's Gummo ... I think it's extremely appropriate that this movie has been released. in Sundance (just because Archer had connections at the festival through volunteer work he did, by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be the only festival where heavy cliches like this are still accepted as "arthouse". No, it's not an art house, I'm afraid it's just a real home. Do not watch.
