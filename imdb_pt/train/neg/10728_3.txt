The worst movie I've seen in a long time. Interesting first half with some engaging, concise dialogue between the dubious characters in a late night bar. The film then degenerates into a formless succession of scenes aimed at a visual shock (read disgust) without any redemptive remarks or lessons in humanity or anything else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to leave, but the director was present at this exhibition and my politeness prevented me from showing him disrespect. Still, time is precious (as the director himself remarked in his introduction) and I really regret the time I wasted in the second half of this. <br /> <br /> Thanks were the three main characters in the first time. of the film, especially the female lead.
