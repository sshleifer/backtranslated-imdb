The lack of content in this movie surprised me more. First I thought people would compare this to Rock On! but I'm really surprised to say that this was worse than Rock On! More or less Horrible story Cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you have to be kidding me. The song was Ok Khanabadosh was the movie track the rest was bad! Vipul Shah has not yet learned from Singh's critically acclaimed comedy King. Now Asin .. from where she comes from the feather of the Asin fan out there but she sucked the big time in this badly bad movie, she did not look good in makeup overdose! My final verdict is going to watch Aladin with his family instead of wasting his time here.
