No real plot for this, just a series of short sketches acting some very old jokes. I laughed once or twice in the beginning to my disgust. But even with just 73 minutes this movie wears off, is welcome in no time and becomes tedious (with some nudity sprayed here and there to keep him awake). Still as bad as this movie is (and this is very putrid), it's a comic gem compared to just about everything by Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg (date film, epic film, Meet the Spartans) also music is unfortunately a a little captivating in a sad way. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: 11 pairs of breasts, 3 shrubs, 3 asses <br /> <br /> My Category: D <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Original trailer for this movie; and trailers for "Beyond the Door", "Dead Pit", "The Farmer", "Obsessed Ones", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" and "Wacky Taxi"
