Batman's Mystery Batwoman is, in a word, obsolete. The plot says that a mysterious vigilante woman ("Batwoman") is invading Batman territory, and while Batman is trying to fight a Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne trio, he is trying to figure out who he is The mysterious Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> There's nothing incredibly wrong about it, but there's nothing special about it either, noting that it really stands out. <br /> <br /> The Ghost Mask had the love of Bruce lost long ago and messed his head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was a big event in Mr. Freeze's life. <br /> <br /> Even the movie Batman Beyond, Return of the Joker, delved into the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But Mystery of the Batwoman had some subplots, many formulas with a mediocre piece on a cruise ship. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than the Dark Knight, without the punch and bite that the animated series had in its heyday.
