Then there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's KEVIN, the world's biggest coward. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly insensitive, naughty and virginal AMY girlfriend. When he returns from work to ... a random home ... he meets his "friends", the sexually confused KYLE and the truly revolting DAPHNE. They soon join Daphne's boyfriend, the sex-mad idiot NICK. And there are the title creatures, horrible dog puppets that kill people giving them the heart's desire. The desire of Kyle's heart is to mate with a scary, plump spandex woman. The desire of Nick's heart is to throw grenades into a school cafeteria - I mean disco. Kevin's heart desire is to spank a skinny villain with nunchucks. Amy's heart's desire is to be a nasty bitch. Daphne is already a nasty bitch, so she has no heart desire. Along the way, a really awful band sings a truly weird song. The hobgoblins randomly come back from where they came and explode. "Citizen Kane" can not hold a candle for this true masterpiece of American cinema.
