Ugh! Where to begin ... first, the uninterrupted anguish of Campbell Scott becomes a real disconnect after a while (very little time) as he internalizes his growing anguish, curiosity, and anger. We just do not care! These characters, as presented by the writer and director, are totally unpleasant, and therein lies the key. They have given us nothing to make us care if they are adulterers and if they are still in love with each other. When Scott calmly tells his wife, "I could kill him" in front of his three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfish moodiness disappeared, I almost wished he had - and then did the same thing for the presumptuous. appearance of Denis Leary's wisecracking before being transported out of the bin. A total waste of time and maybe - just maybe - resources.
