I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is unbelievable unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be warned, the following will not only reveal the plot, but will also ruin your appetite to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> A computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye, it can access the "electrical system" of your body. What it does is force the body's cells to excrete calcium. Within seconds after infection the patient reaches his neck, develops the tunnel vision, his skin will become white from the calcium, after which he will fall and his hand and scull will break into a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very smart. When a blind-computing expert is discovered to be trying to disassemble the code with a braille-operated device - hands-operated - the device is set at a very high voltage, which causes severe injuries to the skin of the specialist's head. The virus also detects aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately, it could be stopped by playing on an outdated desktop PC in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet on some spilled water. <br /> <br /> Oh dear ...
