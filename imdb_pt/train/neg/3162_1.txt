I did not even bother to finish the movie because I was so bored I thought I was going to faint I was watching in the theaters and me and my friends got tired so we got up and went to another movie if I ever have to sit by 2 min. of that movie again I think I'm going to kill myself ... and I know the whole movie because my friend told me what happened in the end and I was not surprised with all that I want to say with who did not know she was going to do the thing sure and make you happy I mean that you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that. I know I did not miss anything and if someone asked me to see the movie I would say "over my dead body".
