If you like movies like American Pie, Road Trip and Van Wilder; avoid this cinematic junk at all costs. It is a tasteless, grumpy, and bland waste, which should never have been discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months; incomprehensibly bad for all 86 minutes of its execution time. If it had been much longer, I would not have been able to write this review without using profanity. Consider yourself warned!
