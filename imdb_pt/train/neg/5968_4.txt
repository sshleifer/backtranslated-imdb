If this movie were more about Piper Perabo's character and less about the bar, that might have been kind of decent. Violer Stanford of Piper and Karen Friendly (Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) both have a quality virgin kindegarden teacher to them that is captivating. I hope she finds a better movie to be.
