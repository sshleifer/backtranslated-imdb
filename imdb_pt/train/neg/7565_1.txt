This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars I spent in a long, long time. If you knew how often I would go to the movies, you would probably say, this is hard to imagine, but never, unless true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery and suspense, why would not you? The trailer is nothing short of intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the film is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> From cinematography, to screenplay, to acting, this film is a complete failure. If you're reading this, planning to go to the movie expecting some excitement, mystery, action, horror or anything but a one-forty-five-minute loss, I'm afraid you're disappointed. "Why is it so bad," you may be wondering. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the movie left me a little "on the edge", scared or curious. The script was, at best, laughable. There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was so ridiculous that I began to write it as comic relief only to find out a few seconds after it was not. The acting was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but that was a fault. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. The cinematography was horrible, with no moment of suspense or mystique. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually a very hard critic. Frankly when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, poorly executed, poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
