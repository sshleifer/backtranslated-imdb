I'm sorry but this is awful. I told people about this movie and some of the bad performances that are in it and they barely believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern Japanese troops are backed up in time until the days of Busido's warriors, and with their modern weapons, they are match for almost everything. When the troops realize that something strange is happening, every person in the back of the car has to say, "Hey, did my watch stop?" Imagine lines like this being repeated 15 times before they say anything else and you have the lack of greatness of the movie in a nutshell.
