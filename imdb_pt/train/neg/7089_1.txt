A sexually obsessed chef leads a dubious life: one as a married man "happy" with a ten year old, the other as a sex addict. Most of the documentary follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a sex therapist, listening to his story and probing it intelligently. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only main adult character who does not take off her clothes. If she had, I would have rated this movie a big fat F. As it is, it ranks an F +, indicating that it is still a failure, unless someone likes to be bored. It's probably much more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning the garage. "Diary of a sex addict" falls into the category of movies that, once seen, a wish that one had not.
