Why is it that any movie about Cleopatra, the last phage, reveals the worst of cinema? Whatever attraction the woman has for the greatest Roman of all, Julius Ceasar and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seem to come across the screen as if it were not the antics of high school veterans. Despite the luxurious scenery and costumes, this movie is as bad as any Italian extravaganza of the 1950s "sandals and toga". It is true that this kind of spectacle belongs to the big screen, which is why "Gladiator" went very well, but "Gladiator" did not have all the sexual romance. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela has so little talent in acting as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Too bad that some of it was not for others.
