I decided to watch this series after seeing the endless ads for him on the BBC in the weeks before the beginning. I watched, despite the fact that I do not like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry to his fans, but I think we have a case of the Emperor's new clothes with this author's work). I admit the acting is great, it's beautifully filmed and I was reasonably entertained by it - however - I thought the story was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes I feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. The 'explicit' gay sex that the media relied on was done on TV before - over and over again - so it was nothing too shocking, I'm afraid. Full marks for production values, but low for plot / content, I'm afraid.
