I've always written this series as being a complete bash because Jim Belushi was involved in it, and heavily. But then one day a tragic occurrence occurred. After a White Sox game ended, I realized that the remote control was on the other side of the room somehow. Now I could have gotten up and crossed the room to get the remote, or even to the TV to turn on the channel. But then why not get up and cross the country to watch TV in another state? "Nuts for that," I said. So I just decided to hold on to the couch and pick up what fate had reserved for me. What Destiny had booked was an episode of this program, an episode about which I remember very little, except that I did once again a broad and comprehensive generic judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing to support my views. with, and once again I was completely right! This show is a total pie! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a fiery hairy foghorn. Women are physically attractive, but also Stepford is to extract any real feeling from the viewer. There is absolutely no reason to stop running to the local TV station with a gas can and a flamethrower and send out all copies of that mutt wailing back to hell. <br /> <br /> Except .. <br /> <br /> Except for the wonderful comic book designs of Larry Joe Campbell, America's greatest comic actor. This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and he's gold. How good is he really? Well, besides being funny, your job is to make Belushi look good. It's like trying to make the warts on your back look good. But Campbell does it in style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery to win every year. Without Larry Joe, this show would consist of a slightly vague appearance of Courtney Thorne-Smith tapping Belushi's head with a frying pan while he alternately hits his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell named Comedic Bacon because he enhances the taste of all that he is!
