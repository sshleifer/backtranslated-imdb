Could not go to sleep the other night. So I got up, plugged in the tube and this movie was on. The filmmakers bit more than they could chew. As ambitious as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump read like a fairy tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the age. The TGMB relies only on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical where actors have to improvise. The purpose of each character was to fill a silly 60's archetype. See how we were introduced to Finnegan: Embracing his black maid and receiving a framed MLK photo. Criminey, speak of heavy hand. Why not just give him a T-shirt saying "I Heart Black"? <br /> <br /> Sunlight: "Free love is not groovy, man? Oh no, I did not have menstruation." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not to UCLA." Excuse me? There was nothing square about Los Angeles in the '60s. Instead of taking the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we just heard this whiny babbling about not going there. <br /> <br /> I can not even remember the name of the black boy. He was just a prop used to show how other children are racially tolerant. <br /> <br /> The thing is that period pieces do not have to be so cheesy. Take "Dazed & Confused". See how we're introduced to football hero Randall Floyd. We do not see him first on the football field. In fact, we never see him playing football. We are presented to him in class, inviting his nerdy poker friends to a party. In "Dazed," feminism is not a casual byproduct of a girl who is pregnant. It's much more organic, more serious than that. It is refined in the ladies' bathroom during a discussion on the island of Gilligan. Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings. But real life is like this. <br /> <br /> Some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant. I agree! That's why I feel so disappointed by this part of the Baby-Boomer pornostomy.
