I was one of the few non-liberals who came to see Steve's video. It was quite an experience ... in movie propaganda and boredom. I hoped the movie was a documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal, slash-and-burn effort to crush conservatives and the local religious community. It seems certain that it is a self-service for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects their prejudices on the issues. <br /> <br /> What is most surprising is to see all 10 votes that your colleagues posted here. Did they even watch the video? Golly gee Batman, this should be rated with All the President's Men! His ratings are as obvious as the bias in this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, how to stack the votes on IMDb will help a lame movie. Maybe my vote will help balance that.
