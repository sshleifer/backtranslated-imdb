I only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was a little young, so much of the film is blurred in trying to remember. However, I can say that it was not as funny as a movie called tomatoes killers should have been and the most memorable things in this movie are the music and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy. Other than that, the movie is really just scenes of small tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling and people acting in fear and exaggerating how people should do in such a movie. However, just having a very silly premise and a captivating theme song does not make for a good comedy. Although this movie must be a B movie, nothing to be taken seriously, you should still make funny jokes and not try to extend a slightly entertaining premise into a complete movie. Maybe a short would have been good as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to knock over a bigger tomato was actually quite good. The trailer itself looked like a dummy trailer, but they did not make a full movie, and a little weak.
