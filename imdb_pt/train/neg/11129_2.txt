Watch the 1936 version. As personally annoying, I find the voice of Charles Boyer, he is more than a couple to pay for the cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf - I mean, Omar Sharif tries, but not - very fluffy and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being very old, looks like nothing to Marie - nothing! She seems too sophisticated to even think of dying for this man's love in such a way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the entire film that plays the role they are playing is Ava Gardner, whose appearance is Empress Elisabeth. on the screen is appropriately brief (and look for images of the Empress there is more than a passing resemblance) as historically, Empress Elisabeth was not so involved in Rudolf's life.
