great mystery, but the movie goes down the hill from there. The beginning is promising with a car accident and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized by this and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter appears from an old girlfriend asking for help to find her missing daughter. So Ed travels to a mostly female commune island. They do not like outsiders. Very filling is with Ed shown looking around town for the girl. This made the film very long. Finally, it gets a bit better toward the end when we learn about the wacky rituals the woman performs, and finally about the sinister plan reserved for Edward. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is not a well written and very long story. <br /> <br /> FINAL WORD: I would skip this.
