The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar hotel suggested the idea that Wenders lost his vision, his ability to tell compelling stories through a moving image map. The Land of Abundance seals the coffin, I fear, for being a film without imagination, obviously sentimental and clich√©. The characters are totally flat and stereotyped, writing, plot and direction are amateur at best. For the first time in a long time, I was impatient for the film to end so that I could go on with my life. The delirium torn by the Uncle's War, the patriotic abstract staring at the sky at the conclusion ... all seemed so simple and pathetic, hardly the work of a filmmaker who once did some compelling magic on the screen. What happened? The days of experimentation, perceptive writing, and interesting shooting possibilities are long overdue, I'm afraid. Let's hope he finds his inspiration again ... At the Toronto Film Festival, which is where I saw the movie, Wenders was there to introduce him. Completely devoid of humility, he offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I KNOW that you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid he's not wrong anymore ...
