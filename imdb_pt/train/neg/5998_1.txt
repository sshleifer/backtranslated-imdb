The basic formula for the original series was; take someone else, make the public like them, then put them in mortal danger. This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now, we are going 40 years to 2004. We are introduced to Alan Tracy, a somewhat less diligent college boy, with his friend Fermat, a young know-it-all. . They are taken by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the island paradise where the Tracy Family lives, for school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left under the care of Kyrano and his daughter, Tin-Tin, while the adults will rescue John from the Thunderbird 5, which was damaged by a staged accident. This is all part of The Hood's scheme to take Tracy Island so he can steal the machines from Thunderbird ... To steal a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is as soft as that! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is banal, the acting is more of wood than the dolls (of fiberglass), the effects, everything but the special and the score of Hans Zimmer ??? The little bit of Barry Gray's glorious theme flashed through Zimmer's lackluster orchestration. The rest of the score was eminently forgettable. In fact, part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and did not recognize it! I did not even bother to stand to witness Busted's mediocre efforts with the final titles. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Ron Cook worked very well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope looked lost. With the right stuff, they could have been show stoppers. CGI's work was what I would call the tip - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main ship was wrong; The original series models at least moved as if they had mass. <br /> <br /> Another sensitive point is that the entire production seemed to be a long set of product placements, all vehicles being built by Ford to all the contents of Tracy Freezer being produced by Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My son (9) liked the movie, but this cross between Spy Kids and Clockstoppers, directed directly at his age, did not add anything to the Thunderbirds legend. . When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979 with The Motion Picture, a whole new life was inspired by the franchise that went on for another 20 years. With this film, Frakes missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, like 'The Avengers' and 'the Saint' before it, will sink into obscurity. within 6 months, leaving the original series to its 'classic' status.
