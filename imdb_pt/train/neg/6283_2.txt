That's incredible for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> You bring together a lot of friends at home, all hyped about the work of accompanying Sean Ellis. You have a vague idea of ​​the plot, no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> It's late at night, perfect atmosphere for such a movie. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes passes and you start to tell yourself that you are bound to catch, in 25min you start to wonder if you should just go to sleep and save it for another time when you can fully appreciate the subtle touches expected not exist. Over the half hour, you realize that half of your sensational audience is already asleep and ends the day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when you exhaust all the other materials to watch, come back to it, in the middle of the day this time, hoping your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later, you find yourself accelerating the unbelievable and unnecessary intermediate transitions and images. Anything else I would have given up, but there is cashback and its legacy. But this legacy can only take you for so long, this is a new level of boring movie production, imagine a tale that extends to a novel with only descriptions, that's what it is. <br /> <br /> The decent cast is wasted, there is cinematography that leaves you impressed as the cashback too. There are movies that bother you, there are movies that do not have certain aspects, or just cheesy, unfortunately this is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The final words, stay away.
