Even if someone did not realize that Sellers had health problems at the time of filming and died before the release of the film, FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be a painful sight. It's supposed to be some sort of villain of Sax Rohmer's famous eastern villain, but it has no focus. The potential for satirical commentary on the anti-Oriental tones of Rohmer's concept is ignored. In fact, the film employs racist insults. There are almost no real jokes or jokes, only mostly actors behaving stupidly and dropping sad lines. It is especially distressing to see Sid Caesar forced to utter cursing and racial slurs by attempts at laughter. Most of the other actors are ashamed as well. <br /> <br /> And then there's Peter Sellers. He plays the two roles of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to invent a formula to reclaim his youth and his faithful British nemesis Nayland Smith. Stores is not one hundred percent bad; He conveys a peculiar warmth like Smith when he discusses his fetishistic attachment to his lawn mower and he is strangely moving like Manchu when he expresses his love for the entertainment of the English music room. But most of the time, he plays both roles with a weary severity, further sabotaging any comedic possibilities. The Sellers routines, in which it revitalizes its fading force with electric shocks, are particularly unbearable; he seems too agonized to be funny. Some genuinely witty lines, an excerpt from Bapt Kwouk (Cato in the films PINK PANTHER) as one of Manchu's lackeys, and Helen Mirren's entertaining musical numbers can not save this mess. If anyone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedy genius, they will not learn anything from FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
