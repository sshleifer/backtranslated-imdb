no redeeming quality can be expressed. I wish I could have my time back. A beautiful broad skull face really smiles, bright for the camera when the disease has already caused enough damage in the misinformed script. I was (spoiler) happy to see all the characters killed or seriously disabled by the end, especially the party bakers who drink the contaminated juice on their way to the alleged sunset. Eli Roth shines for a few moments, maybe ten, putting into practice the theory of how well weeds smoke in the woods when others actually advocate beer consumption. on the whole, found most of it useless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the end of the cast, in a way, wishing the trip had never happened (probably should have been sexing instead of watching TBS late night, ugh).
