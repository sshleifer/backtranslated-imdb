After watching the remake of 1996, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil being punished for torturing animals just for her skin. The whole movie was very funny and, in my opinion, better than the animated one. But there was really no need for a second. First of all, if Cruela is returning, do not heal her and drive her crazy again. Just make her get away from jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It is supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I hoped it was Lucky, since he was the most attractive, and in addition, having Roger and Anita back as well. However, they decided to have a complete overhaul and adding not really a hundred, not even a hundred and two, but only three puppies, and a parrot who thinks he is a (intelligent) dog. The part of Gerard Depardieu was useless. In the end, Cruella is too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She is baked inside a giant cake. This was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect as the first. It just did not work. It was too exaggerated and not very funny. I really felt so much about Cruella.
