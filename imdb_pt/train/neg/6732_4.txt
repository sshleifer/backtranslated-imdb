I discovered this movie at IFC and thought it would be interesting. For "lowercase" love stories, some of the stories really creep into this movie. The fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect the actresses were talking about their own sex lives, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit, I want to start seeing some more romantic views of the first sexual encounters again, as in "Strike! (1998)", when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances began to ask about her supposed first time, and Tweety asked "Was it beautiful? "<br /> <br /> Some may think that scenarios and flashbacks would improve this movie. I think that would make things even worse. It does not necessarily have to be hardcore pornography to get my attention, but somehow I just expected more.
