Well, how should I know this was "the promotional donkey" Lordi Motion Picture "? I mean, I realized that when that" dinosaur "fantasy came along and when the vocalist appeared I was humming" Hard Rock Hallelujah "to myself. .. "Dark Floors" is about a young autistic woman who is in the process of being taken from the hospital by her protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, are momentarily imprisoned ... When they arrive On their floor, it's a great surprise to find that there's no one else around. The hospital is empty ... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to be chasing them for no apparent reason ... They run down the aisles and stairs, encountering all members of the heavy metal band in their strange, shock Rustic costumes ... Nothing really memorable here except the lousy performance, lack of nudity and nudity, and the promotional edge completely disregard reminding me a lot of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yeah, remember that? I wish I had not ... I would just recommend avoiding all these Ghost House movies as a fungus and not listening to Lordi, since they are an imitation Gwar band!
