Irene Dunne ended her illustrious career with this movie more or less. She should have come out with a bang, being the class actress she was, not in this almost unknown, almost unforgettable movie. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is fine, but nothing special. The first half is a lot better, as it gets pretty stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the calligraphy on the wall and give it up. Even his raucous voice got a bit boring here. Rumor has it she was not happy with this movie. You can see why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom. Speaking of which, I thought David Nelson from the TV show Ozzie & Harriet was in that movie, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded like Nelson. Overall, so-so at best and a sub-par end to a great actress.
