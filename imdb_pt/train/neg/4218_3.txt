This is not one of those reviews on special effects or bad technologies, or being dated, issues that only the most foolish people could relate to, but a review of history in which most of us are truly interested. The plot is about a combination of members of the Allied Navy and the German Navy, and two civilians (the hero and heroine) who are pushed together in a German boat and end up in a wild land of dinosaurs . /> <br /> Manipulations are not so bad for movie standards, and we know from the plot that realism will not be high. What movies like this need are credible and friendly characters, along with some semblance of reason in the actions. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have both. For a complete movie, only 6 characters are given at any time, and 3 of them are barely scanned. The McClure hero is beyond routine, and does not make much sense in any age. <br /> <br /> The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of the dinosaurs they entered in, but the riddle is not much of an enigma, and we could care less. <br /> <br /> A lot of failure in a movie that should have been better, even for its time.
