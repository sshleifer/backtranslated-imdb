As far as I'm concerned, this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made. There is no tenderness, love or spirituality about this version, it's all macabre, Germanic and sinister nonsense. It reminded me of the Nazis falling in love; who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version of von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this, we have John Gilbert and his crude relative, the prince, wishing that this daring American actress, played by Mae Murray, possessed a permanent permanent hairstyle and implausible feminist modes that threw me out again and again. I like my light and beautiful novels, with ups and downs; not harsh and sadistic like this. And come on, those chopped bee lips, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> Go see a live performance of the show if you want to get a real idea of ​​the sweetness of Franz Lehar's original operetta. Otherwise, wait until TCM shows the sound version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier. It is much better.
