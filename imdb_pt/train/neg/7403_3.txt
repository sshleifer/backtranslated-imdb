This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's the most you can say about it. It starts with a good atmosphere; the hospital is properly sterile and alienating, the mood is defined as "scary". And then ... nothing. Well, some things. Just a few things that clearly do not fit ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating creatures, and the hospital they have taken. I mean, come on, motorbike asshole? Some band watched a little Gwar too. My personal favorite was the head demon, who looks a lot like a middle-aged trucker desperately trying to threaten, at the same time looking like he really would prefer. to sink into an afghan-covered couch, undo the belt, burst a cheap beer can (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen truckers far more frightening. In the trucks. Drink coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Spooky! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more caricatured and even less scary. At least on the DVD, the videos give an explanation of their presence in the hospital ... they seem to appear randomly in some places, play a bippy "metal" and make people a little dead. Except some good special effects and acting that is not entirely terrible, given the lack of a decent writing, there is nothing here. It's just a background noise movie.
