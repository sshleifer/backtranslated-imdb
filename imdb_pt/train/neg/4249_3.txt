I did not even know that this movie existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I was joking on the Trinity board when I saw some user mention how the Wes Craven series is so much better than the 'crap' that is Blade, so I did my research Quick: I checked the scores on IMDb and RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I discovered that this is a sequel to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that inside the boards of Wes Craven Dracula there was a real strong following for this film that is a big contradiction with the scores I was seeing. <br /> <br /> Now let's take a quick personal recap here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000, and I remember not liking anything, and then seeing Dracula's scores: Ascension only further lowered my expectations, but I'm the kind of person who really needs to watch the movie ( any film) so that I can form my own opinion. <br /> <br /> Some things I was aware of when I started watching this movie was that it's low budget, so because of that, I'm going to have to ignore a lot of v / fx and just find out it's going to be (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br/> Oh geez ?? This movie was CHEESY! But cheese can be fun, at least I found it very funny laughable, poor audio synchronization of rewriting dialogue in some scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Of course they all knew about vampires and some of the basics, Luke still had a book on it, but did that prevent them from purposely wanting to become 'infected'? No, this is worse than horror movies where the girl has to get out of the shower and check the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel. <br /> <br /> I must have blinked at some point too. , because I'm not sure how 'Dracula' has clothes on his body, especially since he's big and brave and I think if I were in this situation, I would not want to be the one to wear it. <br /> <br /> So the movie ends like any movie in the middle of a trilogy ?? this does not happen, instead it's a 'Hangar of the Cliff', where I can now wait for the 3rd installment 'Legacy'. Oh the entertainment value of Cheesy movies.
