I noticed with some fun that in the final credits, the Detroit PD is grateful for their participation. The Chief of Police has even a line of speech playing himself (and kid, you can tell he can not act). The reason for the fun is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later. It's not the kind of public relations I think a police force would want. Other than that, this is your standard movie of cops and robbers dressed for the 70's with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is given an ungrateful role of a Lifer cop who can not get ahead and is sealed with a mentally ill wife. He makes up for it by hanging out at the local brothel. Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner who has an elegant wardrobe and likes to chase suspects wearing a waterproof coat. The film continues until the penultimate gunfire that makes absolutely no sense (why are people who are only guilty of a robbery assuming a whole police force?). Not only do we see a gunfight, but since there are four bad guys, we can see four of them. Then there's a twist that should leave someone guessing what really would have happened, but it just left me wondering just how stupid it was. Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind "Friday Foster" and "Bucktown", I should not have thought.
