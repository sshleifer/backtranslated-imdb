With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly one of the most stupid movies ever made. It's about the waiter of the cruise ship Shecky (Sandler) wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First of all, there is not a funny or clever line throughout the film honestly. It's so dull it's pathetic. There is, surprisingly, very crude or sexual humor, but the word f is abundant. The budget is very low and this also spoils the film. It happens on a cruise ship, but it looks like they only had money to rent a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. Opening credits are cheaply animated, and are just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone who sees this will also hate it. <br /> <br /> 86 mins. classified as R for Language.
