This movie is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story almost does not exist, the characters are full of stereotypes and the Special-FX just makes you laugh. The only notable thing about this movie is the appearance of Rapper Coolio as some kind of cop. <br /> <br /> If this movie should be a comedy, I did not get it right. If you want to watch this movie: first get drunk and get ready for some good laughs ... especially when the first special movie shows up on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like trash films made on the cheap: this movie is a must for you.
