As big as a Texas prairie and equally annoying. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can not float on this exaggerated boat. Taylor, in fact, FAILS wrong - wrong wardrobe, wrong hair and wrong makeup - a unique achievement in his remarkable career. Hopper gives the only credible performance, and Dean on the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we do not usually remember him - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes you think what, say, Redford could have done with the male protagonist. There is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes, just a pastiche of landmarks that have little relation to each other. With the exception of Hopper, there is character development, just a collection of cardboard cutouts that periodically arise for no discernible reason, such as random targets in a shooting gallery. To their credit, the film tackles racism and sexism at a time when they were taboos, and has SIZE, making it an excellent choice to get rid of unwanted guests from the house. Those with the DVD version can save themselves from boredom, starting with the second disc. You will not lose any interest.
