As a South African, it is an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the writers of the original Shaka Zulu mini, this "addition" to the series is terrible! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played an important role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. The plot of this film, however, is nothing but nonsense, ripped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer who It has not impressed since the mid-nineties. <br /> <br /> While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what is David Hasselhoff doing here, rescuing slaves drowning in his red buoy and white smile? <br /> <br /> I kept expecting blond, beady women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits for no apparent reason. Not that this was more bizarre than the fantastic plot that was probably dreamed after 10 liters of beer at a fancy party where someone's cave man costume inspired the writer to return to an African theme for his next " blockbuster ".
