There was nothing about this movie that I liked. It was so obviously low budget with low lighting and camera work (almost like the Blair Witch Project, but that was not supposed to be so). There was not really much to the plot, and the film just drug and so on. In fact, I made the fastest move in the last 1/3 of the films, but that did not help much. It looked like it might be good from the box, but I must say again: nothing about this movie still looked good. There were no good actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully awful. On my personal scale, I give this movie 0 out of 10. Yikes!
