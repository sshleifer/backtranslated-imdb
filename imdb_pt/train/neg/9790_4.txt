They return home with a strange and new brother ... a dressed and well dressed mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox). Yes, rat. Stuart is happy to have found the sense of belonging, even if it's in a super big world that contains the pet cat of his new family, Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane).
