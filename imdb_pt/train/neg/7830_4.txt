So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes have been erratic and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in terms of groundbreaking narrative or real scares, but at least it was well-directed, suspenseful and visually interesting, with solid performance by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series . <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was terrible, and not in a good way. The script is bad, requiring the superficial and unpleasant protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot, and make the characters indulge indefinitely for the purpose of awkward and unnecessary exposure. The acting is exaggerated and unconvincing, and I felt much more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newly married couple on Monday. The director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative daunting, but with amateur acting and writing, the end result looks like a movie school project for beginners, with camera moves for its own good and little in terms of plot . or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be very disappointed. I look forward to the rendering of William H. Macy, and I hope he has a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far, the quality is very inconsistent to predict anyway.
