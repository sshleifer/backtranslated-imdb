Funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to the Romero version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is an animated, action-packed, bloody video and "Whoopee" full of 2 hours of MTV. Frenetic editing, pop-video camera work, "cool" music blah blah blah <br /> <br /> Actually not bad compared to other recent remakes (the Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster) ... a lot good to play round, totally predictable in the bets "who will die next" and a total of money in the name Dawn Of The Dead which will generate plenty of revenue from the fans of the original who will see it out of curiosity ... Do not remakes of classics get on your nerves? Can they REALLY NOT come with something original? Why Remake Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the medium segment that kids think is so annoying is supposed to be slow to show how, when you get everything you've ever wanted, you're still not happy) are totally gone. This is a simple and straightforward action movie. The faster the better. If you like action movies (and like that, the 2004 version is well made) is fair, but for those who like a little substance in their movies ... get ready to sigh (again) ... <br /> <Watch the theaters over the next few years as we get the Godfather series remade by whoever is the hottest pop director at the moment, and Star Wars is redone, with all the kids saying how the new version is better the version is slow and boring and holds a photo of the camera for more than 5 seconds ... Not bad, but in 10 years they will still be discussing Romero's version, not this pap
