After seeing only half of the film at school in November, today I saw that it was on the Flix channel and I decided to watch it to see the rest and write a new review. <br /> <br /> The book on which the film is based, Hatchet, is OK. This is a very bad adaptation of that. <br /> <br /> A horrible performance (and I mean horrible), a bad dialogue and a common cinematography make up this terrible adaptation of Hatchet. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Brian, who is the cliché image of a teenager of the 80s (boasting a mullet, banging his head with a cheap 80s rock) and his mother driving in a car for him get on a plane to see your father (your parents are divorced ... now gives the break dramatic.) Now Brian said goodbye to Mom and dog and is flying to see your father. The pilot is a fat, ugly and rude man (it was not so in the book) that after 2 minutes in the air, had a heart attack and died. In the book he goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack. The plane (within two more minutes) was empty in fuel (leaving us, the viewers, to assume that it is there for hours, even if the sun has not changed its position and the scene seems EXACTLY the same.) Now he landed. <br /> This is the point in the movie where everything is very different from what was in the book. In the book, he said that his jacket was torn to pieces, but in the film is perfectly fine, no tears or tears (it seems he just bought), never said he climbed a mountain, saw a wolf and fell asleep there. on the mountain, he never said he was attacked by a bear (said a moose but not a bear), he never said that he eats the various insects he makes, he never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to catch those sparrows, peels them and eat them or that little trap he does (which is destroyed by one of the tornadoes) or even mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> I think you can call what was described in the movie of a tornado. All that was was just a storm that knocked over several of his things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp festival was Brian's lame flashbacks (which are never mentioned in the book), especially Brian's cliché scene waking up, walking to the window and seeing his father (with all the your tidy things that can fit neatly into the back of your truck) coming out and yelling "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (but of course his father did not hear him even though he was outside) and he punches the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The end is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book (I said close.) In the book I think one of the main things that the rescue pilot told Brian when he landed was "you're the kid they're looking for!" They stopped months ago ... "however they they left that line in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian (somehow without counseling or therapy) getting back to normal with his family. I think we should assume they were joining for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey at the counter). Then he shows his temporary home (for what in the movie looked like three days but in the book was for several months) and his ax, still in a tree where he left (also did not happen in the book) showing where he carved a message , so perfectly done: "HOME" (where should we really believe he carved the one who perfectly with just that ax?) No quote can best summarize this movie when Enid of Ghost World said "this is so bad that it went from good to bad again. " Perfect description of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to someone (who has not read the book) and is just wanting to watch a movie or someone who has read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored to death. <br /> <br /> For those who have read the book, leave what your imagination created as the movie.This is horrible and will bring your thoughts about the book.
