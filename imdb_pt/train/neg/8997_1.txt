This is the worst movie I've ever paid to see and with the exception of "They Saved Hitler's Brain" the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and therefore was anticipating what I thought would be the funniest film that could be produced, since I did not have the restrictions that TV improvisation programs should to deal. The writers must have thought we're going to play some rudeness, some flatulence jokes, some cheap sex, and hey, we've got a risky side sharing laughable comedy. The game show skits are nothing more than unimaginable lows in Let's Make a Deal with stupid rudeness. The sit-down take-off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just plain bad-tempered high school. The announcement of stun guns was humor fit for Seasame Street. LA's subway set was an insipid mood using insipid blood. The French chef blind walking constantly uttering "no difference" with a French accent was, well, you get my point. <br /> <br /> The only funny thing involved was Chevy Chase, which lasted a full minute. That means you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this movie. Oh yeah, I've read the comments about the whole country being stoned in the '70s and you're going to like this movie if it's flat. Well, most of the country was not stoned in the 1970s. If inept writers were stoned, they must have been in sleepy medicine. There were 4 other people in the theater besides me when I saw this movie. Of course the word still did not come out about how bad the movie was.
