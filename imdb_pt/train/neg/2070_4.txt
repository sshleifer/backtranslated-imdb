After many bad memories, I jumped to skip this episode every time he appeared in the wake of Season Two. Recently, I watched again just to remind myself why. I've always considered this the worst episode of ST: TNG (except for "Shades of Gray," which barely counts as an episode). <br /> <br /> I continue to listen to the clumsy and thinking script of the red-penciled script by author author 101: "SHOW, DO NOT SAY!" From the pronouncement of Deanna Troi, and all the other constant reminders about what a beautiful and dangerous Okona is, to Guinan's explanation of how funny his droid joke is (is not), for the resolution of who is matter with the conflict, there is not a point of plot that is not highlighted and triplamente underlined for our edification, and there is no believable moment in any of that. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor under other circumstances, is too cowardly to be the center of the plot's machinations. On the other hand, it may be that none other than John Barrowman (Jack Harkness of "Doctor Who") could pull that place out of a role. <br /> <br /> (Zero points, by the way, Although I think Joe Piscopo was no longer funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here, although Jerry Lewis's bit was funny from a stupid way.) <br /> <br /> Good morning, you may be able to think of it as a small and lovely tribute to a minor episode of the Original Series. I'd rather jump to "Time Squared" or "Q Who".
