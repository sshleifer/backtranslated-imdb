Kenneth Branagh tries to transform William Shakspeare's obscure and rarely produced comedy into a 1930s musical, with the result being both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy, since actors are rarely adept at one or other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly on both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as Costard, but is very much mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone, who deals with the Shakespearean language with all the authority of a Valley girl who is reading the script in loud voice The musical numbers are staged with the experience of a high school production of "Dames at Sea", leaving the cast looking clumsy and amateur while singing and dancing, with the sole exception being Adrian Lester, who is a splendid singer and dancer. The only other saving grace of the film is the contribution of Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer as eyeshadows, but they gave much better performances than in this movie and you would be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and give it a mess not funny.
