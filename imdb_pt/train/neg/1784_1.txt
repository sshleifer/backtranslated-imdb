OK, I recorded it on TV and missed the start. The movie had about 10 seconds in the titles (I suppose), so if anything happened before I missed it. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Mark Hammill is in this, I did not see him. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis and, of course, Stephen King doing a really horrible performance as a graveyard attendant. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige looks adorable beyond the scenes in that she has the cat face or is in full alien. Even with the opening titles, it is never really explained very well exactly what the Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the title sequence, I assume they are feline bipeds that live by drawing life force from humans. I suppose they live a long time and these two in particular are possibly the last of their kind. <br /> <br /> Add to that a very large dose of incest (Yes! I thought I was a little suspicious too), Metamorphosis, Killer Cats and Invisibility and you have sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> It is a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the two main characters and many appearances to try to distract from the simple fact that is not enough explained to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
