Boring, long, pretentious, repetitive, self-involved? this movement seemed like a bad meeting. Worse, the art school's tedious direction - with heavy use of the shot that gets so exaggerated that it almost made me vomit - is constantly screaming to be noticed. Add the finest of plots and virtually no dialogue, and the movie begins to look like a four-hour epic with about 30 minutes. Worse: instead of dialogue, there are poorly written voices and quotes and songs that remark very obviously about the characters. Very good opera music too. Blame everything on the director. <br /> <br /> The actors are all very good. Lead actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suited for movie stardom. He and the other actors have some erotic moments. Even these start to get boring after 5 minutes, however, and wonders if the director is auditioning for a Bel Ami porn work. The impressive architecture of the university campus as a venue in Mexico City is inspiring. How are US universities so soft (SFSU, UC, etc.)? But wait for the DVD in this movie. Will you want to use the Quick Scan button? very.
