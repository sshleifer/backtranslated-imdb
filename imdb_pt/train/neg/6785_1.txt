You're warned this is a spoiler! This movie is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. great direction the shots were well thought out. the actors were very good, particularly Richard, because I wish I had seen more of him. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classics. Dudley More god bless he could have done better. John Ritter again I would have liked to see more of him. In my opinion, this failure is entirely due to the failure of the writer. Maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating. Its pretty bad that so much money went into this boiler, when with a little change here and there, in my opinion it fixed it. They must have paid the standard rates for writers. To make a laugh.
