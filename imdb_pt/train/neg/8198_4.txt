Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: It's me or every movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico, sucks. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with the contact, mixed with all things on the beach, The Andromeda Strain, the Raiders classroom scene from the Lost Ark and a throw in a small Stargate to boot. <br /> <br /> Derivative does not even begin to describe this movie. Of course without anything of original plot they increase blood and sex, right? No, gore is a blink and you miss the subject and sex is all provocative. (James Spader causally mentions that he needs a shower and the delicious Leslie Stefanson asks to join him ?? "He rejects it. AGGH!) In fact, if a movie always needed a scene to cheer things up, that's it. I mean, if you're going to have impossibly pretty women in white bathing suits wandering around on an Antarctic research base, why not run out of money? With about 30 seconds of real excitement throughout the movie, Alien Hunter is remarkably serious and slow going on a science fiction adventure. It needed a much better turnaround to cheer up, and by the way, Alien himself is a horribly clich√©d device and hardly has screen time for someone who shares half the title. <br /> <br /> I also asked during the visualization of what is with the "Corn Kids in Space" reason. (Note that since Friday's 13th to 13th fame, Hellraiser's Pinhead and that Leprechaun traveled into space to kill naked teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress up as Logan's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them. <br /> <br /> This, however, would have been thrilling and apparently against this pact of films. The acting is very good, as Spader reprises his role in the Stargate, while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch, however, read the whole script and acts like a madman well before the story told him. <br /> <br /> Alien Hunter is a disheartening derivative that makes me twist for an adequate Children of The Corn in Film space.
