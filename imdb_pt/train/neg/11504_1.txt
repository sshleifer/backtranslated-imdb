AKA: Mondays in the sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just saw. Three men wander aimlessly and drink, complaining about everything and everyone on their way. This is supposed to be a drama, but what it is, is a total waste of film, without a single redeeming quality. <br /> <br /> I read the critics announcing the performances here as "wonderful," "handsome," and "heroic." I'm afraid I can not agree, unless these men should have been the most ignorant protohumans who ever walked. <br /> <br /> In all? This was not a movie. He wanders and loses everyone except the public. I've watched it three times, and I can not for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage. There's nothing deep here, whatever. It sucks. <br /> <br /> He ranks a ZERO / 10 of ... <br /> the Demon :.
