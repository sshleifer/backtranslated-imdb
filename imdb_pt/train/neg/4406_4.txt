This lackluster Italian action / science-fiction hybrid features David Warbeck as a Miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of Atlantis (!) To prevent an evil businessman (John Ireland) from choosing a telepathic fetus using spores of an asteroid to dominate the world. Do you have it all? Despite such a loopy plot, this is actually quite annoying and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS mocks with contempt. Honestly, the most (intentionally) creative thing about this movie is the slight reworking of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a laboratory that is inexplicably shown twice consecutively. Maybe the director Alberto De Martino wanted to show us all the vanguard in the twilight of his career? I was going to declare Ireland's worst film on your resume, but then I saw that the SATAN CITY LEADERS were on the list. I would also like to declare with confidence that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and Hitchcock's VERDUCT.
