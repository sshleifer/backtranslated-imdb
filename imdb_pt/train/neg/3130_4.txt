I entered this movie really wanting to line up. I thought the premise had a lot of potential and was ripe for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong here, I was not expecting Citizen Kane, I was taking this to the B movie that it is. That said, it still fell short of expectation. The historical aspect of the story is glazed and the ending made me a little cold. The acting in the film was a lot of wood. After all, I gave 4 for a great idea, but the film could have scored a lot more with a little more attention to the fundamentals of cinema. Is it worth seeing? I did not want my two hours back, but I do not know if I would recommend it to other people.
