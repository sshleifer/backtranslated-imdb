You will notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and can speak, is played by Stephen King. "Do not give up on your daily work" is the normal thing to say, but that's not fair. King acquits himself reasonably well: he is no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most. History, on the other hand, is sheer bullshit. Please give up on your day job. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many terrible performances - of which that of the lead actor (that of LEAD ACTOR'S!) is probably the worst - put together in the only film. Everyone acts quickly, but not in a fun way; they all somehow manage to push the limit without spending or manifesting energy. I blame screenwriter / director Tom Holland. It can not be that ALL the actors are REALLY so bad. What are the odds against this? Of course, I've never heard of any of them before, but still, I do not think I could get into a talent agency and hang out with so many bad artists if I tried: An actor, despite my best efforts, would become to have talent. So what is more likely - that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes, or that he wrote a bad script and then misled him? This would also explain why the actors are bad in the direct proportion of their prominence in the script. The more direction an actor had, the worse he presented himself. ("Do you want me to bend like a hump, speak from the back of my throat, show all my teeth, and look bored, all at the same time?") <br /> <br /> The theory is confirmed by the fact that the Netherlands undeniably managed to co-write a lousy script. Several writers here commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a nice character, but that's a misleading way to put it. He is not a knowable character. All we find out about him before supernatural things start to happen is that he's fat and all he can think about is food. ("All I can think of is food," he tells us helpfully.) And in the end ... <br /> <br /> (Sigh) I suppose I should insert a spoiler warning here ... <br /> In the end, it becomes bad. Because? I can only shrug. Maybe he's under some sort of enchantment. Yes, that's probably it. By "evil," I may mean "inexplicable" -is not so much malice as a socially undesirable suspension of the common psychology of the ends of the means. Anyway, their actions in the end make no sense, no one's actions make much sense, and this despite the fact that the characters do little more than explain their motivation to the benefit of the public. <br /> <br /> By the way, here's my candidate for the best line / delivery: "I do not think you'd like that." FACT ... "[great dramatic pause]" ... I do not think would you like that. "
