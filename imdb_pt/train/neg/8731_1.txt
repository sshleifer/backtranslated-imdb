Is the lowest possible score a star? This is a shame. really, I'm going to press IMDb for a "zero-star" option. give this film even a single star is giving way too. Am I the only one who noticed the microphones hanging over the funnel head at the station? and the acting, or should I say lacking it? apparently talent was not a factor when the casting director came to town. the talent show at my sister's elementary school provides greater range and depth of emotion. and those false Irish accents were like nails on a chalkboard. the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been ... oh, wait, no, no, it's already as bad as possible.
