Watching the cast, I recently watched this movie at TCM, waiting for an underrated gem, as I consider many 1930s movies. This is not a gem - not even semi-precious. The anachronistic clothes and the Rolls Royce limousine of the thirties hit him immediately. The cast is weird too. But, most of the time, there are many stupid and unnecessary plotting devices. This movie has many good ingredients and a basic storyline that promises, but the components are not mixed according to the right recipe. It just does not come together as it should. And this is a shame. With some pretty obvious but small changes, this could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about an American showgirl (Jean Harlow) looking for a wealthy British husband - preferably the nobility. She meets Franchot Tone and his friend, who are in a lark on a Rolls Royce owned by their friend's employer. Harlow erroneously assumes that Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls, and she points to him. This early part of the film is a comedy of light without any real distinction. <br /> <br /> However, Tom unintentionally reveals the fact that his employer is actually a fifth German columnist on the eve of World War I, and that is when the film changes tone completely and begins to crumble. Tom and Harlow are married, but as soon as the honeymoon begins, he is shot dead by a Mata Hari type (Benita Hume), and Harlow runs away from the scene, with a viewer accusing her of Tone's murder. (In fact, Tone recovers from the wounds.) <br /> <br /> Harlow flees to France, where she falls in love again - this time with a rich French cad (Cary Grant). Tom, now in the military, and Harlow are unexpectedly brought back into Grant's hospital room, where he is in rehab due to a plane crash. In the next scene, Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold bulldozer. Harlow never explains about the witness' accusing her of murder and her panic! This is one of those unreal shrinking movie frames in the story. <br /> <br /> So Tom is also brought back into contact with the woman (Hume) who shot him. She is on hand to watch her lover, Grant, test the new airplane that Tom gave her from England. Incredibly, both Hume and Tone recognize each other, but simply can not get from where! Okay, so Tom was shot and almost killed; maybe your memory is a bit out of tune. But how many men did Hume shoot that she would forget one of his marks? (She does not seem to be faking her memory.) <br /> <br /> This is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume should have recognized him at all, but he pretended it was when he realized that Tom could not put it on. That would have been a much better treatment of that. <br /> <br /> The ending is also very unsatisfactory. The film, as done, has Tone and Harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the bastard, Grant, leading to his fraudulent funeral as a hero. So Harlow and Tone just walk away. It is noble to preserve the French public's perception of its national war hero, but very unsatisfying as a love story! <br /> <br /> What the movie asks for is this: Harlow explains that she ran away in a panic in the face. of murder charges; Tom forgives her and calmly rekindles her love for her; he then carries a torch for her, even while helping her manipulate the accident site to preserve Grant's reputation. Meanwhile, Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the idiot he is. Having seen Tone for the brave and noble man he is, Harlow rekindles feelings for him as well. At the end of the film, the two reconcile as they work together to improvise Grant's death. After the funeral of Grant's hero, we see them embrace and kiss in fading. That would have made a cool little movie. For Cary Grant fans, it would have been even better if Tone had played the murdered French cadet and granted the first suffering husband reunited with Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone should be scaled the Irishman who lives in England, while Cary Grant is scaled up like the Frenchman. This movie would have been much better if they had reversed the roles. This would also have been more conducive to the movie than it should have been ...
