Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman movie, but that was really bad. The kind of bad thing that makes you wish you could have that time back in your life, the kind of bad thing that makes you think "what on earth they were thinking of filming it in the first place," the kind of bad thing that makes you wish it would take you another 50 minutes to get in the kitchen for a snack during the movie, the kind of bad thing that makes leprosy seem like fun, the kind of bad thing that makes you think you want to rent a Pauly Shore movie. .. I can not explain how bad this was. That being said ... there were a few half-amused laughs, but they're a lot less fun than the Anchor. Of course, they tried to make it fun and fun, but the whole subplot that was left out of the Anchorman that arrived here was genuinely left out for good reason ... it was not even a good one. Do yourself a favor, and do not watch this DVD ... it will tarnish the good movie that Anchorman is and you do not want to do that. <br /> Okay ... I'm fine now.
