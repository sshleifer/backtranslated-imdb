Someone needs to send this guy Uli Lommel back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who told him he knew how to make a movie? Only someone can make movies these days? In the past, talent was always needed before anyone could make a movie. After watching this lame BTK movie and the others he did, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor have as much business making movies as I do. In fact, I think even I could make movies better than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with BTK Killer, besides the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S IT. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other crap that's absurd in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to entice people to watch your movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely pitiful. The only serial killer movie that I would consider worse is that movie "DAHMER". That boy smoked so many cigarettes that it made me sick. Whoever did this needs to be shot.
