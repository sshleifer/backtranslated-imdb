Wow, after trashing the record of Timo Roses "Rout City" after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than nonsense curses ... I think some people just do not understand) I was interested in this movie. I read a few positive things and the packaging and appearance of the movie seemed far from the total rubbish I expected after "City of Routes". <br /> <br /> Surprise: The movie is not total junk, but the problem seems to be just that. Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of the German Horror / Splatter Cinema, such as Olaf Ittenbach and others. This means that "Barricade" is in extremely bloody and detailed parts. The Gore FX is not really believable, but OK, the acting is good, but in some cases it sucks. The country girl in the opening sequence is ridiculous and does not improve until she is shot. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem ... the movie is bloody, has a typical German underground vibe (including the classic blood booby shots), OK FX and a modern twist on it as the packaging already fiancee <br /> <br /> 1. The script is BS total. You get a typical hickory / lost in the history of the forest with some guys + gal camping and meet a degenerate hickory family. Everything is just leading to the scenes of torture / mutilation and it seems unbelievably random and pointless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricade" discouraged. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also the perfect description for a lot of camera work (I liked the repetitive cut for the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene ... or they had no material or the editor works on a hardware store). Even worse the editing ... sure, is modern and much better than many other films of the genre, but it is RANDOM. You have an overuse of this typical exposure effect everywhere and without any meaning ... it's just there ... all the time. So there is a grainy / noisy film aspect that is also played here and there because of it, I did not understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. Like the effects mentioned earlier, there are many repetitive things here. For example, most deaths are edited with multiple stab and drill repetitions. Its OK once but here it is annoying and unreal, especially in the end. Annoying also attributes the "music" that is used permanently without any change in the background. It does not take long until it makes the movie difficult. <br /> <br /> 4. Of all this comes the biggest problem of this movie (and many others in my opinion). If you make a splatter movie with junk, it will be silly enough to polish it with special effects and new edits in school. It seems they take it very seriously. It's no fun because the decadent content of FX is simply wasted in that context. And where the classic FX gore is OK, the FX computer in scenes like stabbing in the mouth or the shots at the end seem a bit silly (and the 3D splatter sucks for myself in movies with a decent budget and 3D artists). I've often wondered if the era of serious splatter movies has run out and "Barricade" is just another example that maybe it's time to put it in the grave. It is not fun, has no character and is very useless for your look. The script is a cheap attempt on "Wrong Turn" and "TCM", leading absolutely nowhere. You can take it literally ... the end is there and as random as many other things here ("I love you" in a splatter movie ... come on !!). "Barricade" tries to incorporate a lot and fails ... you can fast forward in this movie for an extensive ripping, melt the sour face, pinch the nipple and make a classic of Friday in the style 13 of a couple while strumming in a tent breasts hooray!). But it's really hard to get through it. Total failure, especially as you can see it could have been something.
