Before watching this film, check out the reviews available on the Internet about the film's counterfeiting, particularly its prevarications about the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men were expelled from Srebrenica and shot by Serb paramilitaries. The documentary also belongs to several American pro-Serbian organizations. Please watch this movie critically, and read reviews previously. Most critics argue that the documentarist takes his arguments too far, even though he raises questions that address conventional wisdom about war. A review in Stephen Holden's NYTimes states that it would be "inaccurate to label this pro-Serbian documentary," but one must question both the presentation of facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and the omission of those facts that inculcate the forces Serbs. I do not advise you not to see this documentary, but I advise you to examine it with a particularly critical eye (as it should be done at all times anyway).
