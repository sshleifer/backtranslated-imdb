It's not exactly a new plot, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a beautiful dead woman (Kate Beckinsale) continue to meet by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other. Although both are promised to others ... incredible as it may seem, they still feel that their soul mate is somewhere. A little mellow in some places, but love lives. Being romantic, I'm almost forced to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and the snow begins to fall. The ending is almost too sweet, but more deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deepest roles, but who the hell could not be hit by Beckinsale. An outstanding support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen in him. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is quirky and funny. See it with your soul mate.
