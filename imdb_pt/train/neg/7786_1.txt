I should have never watched this movie. The style of filming may be considered artistic to some, but it is considered to be a migraine inducer for me. I think it may have had an interesting storyline, but since I have not been able to watch it for long periods of time I've missed a lot. The shaky images and the stop motion footage marked my brain. I stopped watching it half way and I will not go back for a second try. I suppose if I were alone at home in my own lighthouse on a dark and stormy night, this could just be the ticket ... PS I'm not sure if the headlight / movie style might be considered a spoiler, but I do not want to be blacklist on my first review;)
