In the words of Charles Dance's character in this movie, "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development, and totally unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Full of things that just do not happen in the real world (since when were the British police inspectors armed with guns in their shoulder holsters?). Full of mistakes (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of dull and artificial dialogue. And the direction / edit is awful - portable camera shots that add nothing to the movie, except for a vague sense of motion sickness; confused jumping cuts; without structure. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes' character is totally unfriendly - why should we care what happens to him? Straight to the video? Straight to the dustbin!
