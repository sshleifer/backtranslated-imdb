First things first: I'm not a conservative. And even though I never referred to myself as a Liberal or Democrat, I opposed the war in Iraq from day one. I think it's safe to say that John Cusack and I would probably see eyeballs in politics, in fact, I'm sure we would become drink buddies if we were ever to talk about how good the BBC's Adam Curtis documents are. My point is this: do not discredit this review, thinking that I am not part of the chorus that Cusack is preaching in War, Inc. There is no doubt that WI politics is tailor made to attract my audience, but the problem is that the tailoring is precarious and the film that Cusack co-wrote, produced and starred in, fits worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As they say, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." Cusack, his co-writers, director Joshua Seftel, and even the actors involved, no doubt had every intention of making an anti-war film as biting and funny as Robert Altman's M * A * S * H, unfortunately to the viewer, they ended up with one as bland and unintelligent as Michael Moore's Canadian Bacon. <br /> <br /> The current state of US politics, foreign policy, and the "war effort" are already absurd and, as a result, pathetic, pathetic. and, regrettably comical - just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is: you can not write stuff as funny as what the Bush administration gives us on a daily basis, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem with WI is that it feels like it was gathering in a hurry. To do so, Cusack basically cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the scenery and filled a list of ideas drawn from the collected works of Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas are stuck in your throat in the first twenty minutes of the movie and what makes them so detestable is that none of the jokes or jokes or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton, neo-cons, and US occupation of Iraq are imaginative , smart or funny. The writers are so blinded by their own dogmas that they felt that simply by referring to these issues, the film would be funny and subversive. The problem is ... it's not. So far these ideas are news from yesterday and unless you have lived under the rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and sheer stupidity (read: a right-wing Christian), these insultingly simple jokes. <br /> <br /> Maybe the WI will work if it were more nuanced, subversive, offensive and fattened with detailed research / insights on Occupation. As it is, the jokes and jokes of the vision are all superficial and are so bad, with so little delicacy, subtlety or satiric wickedness that they did little more than make me moan. Homer Simpson once said "It's funny because it's true" and the Daily Show proves it every night; War, Inc., however, proves that just because it's true is not funny. Bottom line: hyperbole is not necessary when it comes to ridiculing American / neo-conservative politics ... it's already a big joke enough. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
