Not really interested in that. The story is very horrible and unconvincing. I liked the first 10 minutes, bill nunns good. After that, it was pretty scary. Tim does not fit the role, he introduces himself as a self-inflatable idiot and Pruitt Taylor Vince is totally unconvincing as a trumpeter. It is an idealistic film and, as a musician, feels a bit offended after watching it. There are no 1900 scenes practicing or playing with his band mates, he is completely self-indulgent. I find it difficult to build any relationship with this type of character, maybe I'm watching the wrong movie. If you do not have a true passion for life or sense of that music, then happily enter the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle.
