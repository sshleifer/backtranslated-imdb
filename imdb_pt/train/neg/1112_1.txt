I like watching western movies, but this movie takes the cookie. The script and dialogue are laughable. The acting was horrible, where did they get it from? The music was fine, I have to say. Luckily I did not buy or rent the movie, but now it's discarded. <br /> <br /> I was prepared at the beginning, when the stranger (martin sheen) began to tell his story. I have to admit that I enjoyed the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong took Tex's finger off and told him to train for 40 years to reach his league. But that's where everything went pear-shaped after that. I had to watch the whole movie hoping it would get better, never do it.
