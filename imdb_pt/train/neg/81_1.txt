Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I could not expect it to end. The plot was pointless. The acting was terrible! Especially for teenagers. The story was played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were appealing and I was really looking for a good thriller. Since at some point life comes up with a good movie, this is not one of them. Unless someone else has nothing else to do, I would avoid this at all costs. That was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I'd rather have scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours and then soaked in hydrogen peroxide. That would have been more fun.
