High heels are tricky things. They can elevate women (or men who dress again) to new heights, present a statement of style and give a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a dangerous pain in the feet that will inevitably lead to stumbles, falls and tragedy. Far heels is more a trip of deception than a stylish high riser. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar's mother and daughter's drama is elegant, for sure, but in terms of plot it is a tedious and tedious subject full of confusing, complex characters that never fully envelop or make sense. Some moments of comedy aside, Tacones distant is simply not interesting. The best part comes at the beginning of a wonderfully macabre homicide affair orchestrated by a child. From this comedy of dark humor, things are improving, but the movie comes to a leap. <br /> <br /> There are quite solid acting performances and there is an elegant and artistic direction you would expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise the Far Tacones is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, broken relationship between mother and daughter and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informant, this could have been a melodramatic power. Instead it is poor. High heels trips for sure.
