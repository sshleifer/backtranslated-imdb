Filmatography: Excellent and pleasant camera angles (I do not remember seeing a movie in recent times, with good close-ups, until the latter). He could have avoided horrible scenes with a soft camera. NY is portrayed good. I liked the angles upside down in particular (a different twist). <br /> <br /> Music: It's not impressive. The songs do not stay in your mind even after watching the movie. May be, I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". A disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal needs to move slowly away from the hard-core action sequences. Your age and belly really appear. Also, he should avoid romantic sequences coming from now on. It was very strange to see a mature / aged star still trying to play like a scene of 20+ heroes. Love can be expressed at any age; As we grow older, you can still express love at a distance (without touching the woman too much, for example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). Jyotika appears for the namesake in the film. I'm not sure why she accepted it. Well, that's not my problem, I guess. <br /> <br /> Others only have a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I expected Gautham to surpass (or increase) for the other movie "Kakka Kakka". He let me down. It took a long time to launch the movie due to various issues. He glides on some scenes. Even obvious things were taken from a famous director. <br /> <br /> General: Just a cool movie. Lots of graphics. DEFINITELY NOT for kids (and adults who expect some sort of "entertainment"). <br /> Thx
