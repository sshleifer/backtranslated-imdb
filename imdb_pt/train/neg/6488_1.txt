Yes, the topic is a direct quote from the movie and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so bored to die with this useless effort. All flashes, etc. do not make sense after the first 20 minutes, it's just a bad movie. + If you are epileptic, you would have died at least five times. Of course all David Lynch fans would create a flag for this type of turkey to be "the best film ever made" because it does not make sense and when it does not make sense, it has to be art and film art is always good. Right? I say wrong. This kind of artificial art is just a pathetic way of trying to show that you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins as an excellent actor must continue to act.
