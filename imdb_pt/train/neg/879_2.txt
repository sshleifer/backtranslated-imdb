David Jannsen was 38 years old and was the father of Robert Drivas, then 31 (yes, I know he should be just out of college, but the script tracks make him a hobo and he's probably 24 - 25 in the script --- which still places Jannsen in parental classes in Junior High). I assume that the AMA wrote a medical miracle in its 1938 medical year. This film has not aged very well and is now its main appeal only to see a snapshot of Sin City around 1969 and all the incessant smoke, the strange hair (Drivas has an atomic comb that makes it resemble the a well (cousin of the prepared hip) and fashions that went along with it.If anyone remembers, LV was not exactly London ... the city mimafia the players of the mafia and the thieves in those days. father thinks he may be gay (in a sad irony, Drivas himself died of AIDS at age 47) and the enslaving conflict is about the generation gap (ahem, as if someone could call a 7-year gap). boy wants to be his own father, and Dad wants to pull him into the casino (Caesar's Palace!), and gives him girls (including Edy Williams, who has lots of money for money). be considered gay - unusual for the time and a fof Brenda Vaccarro is close by to faintly platonic about him. What nudity there is is very lame - exactly what was needed to attract the audience to an 'R' rating in the early days of the MPAA rating system (which was then G-M-R [16] - and X). The issue is HORRIBLE and there are stupid overdubs by The Committee (a neo-avant-garde comedy group from the late 60's who mercifully disappeared from the map in a few years). Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer ... apparently preparing him for a role as a floor manager at CASINO much better, two decades later. Not to give anything, but they would have dealt with Mr. Rickles' character with power tools and a hole in the desert at that time. A curiosity, at best, far from the usual caliber of Joshua Logan's work. Two / Days. Now go see the CASINO again ...
