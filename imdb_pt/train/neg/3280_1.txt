I will not go and give them my $ 10 went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my kids like that and can watch without worrying about what they're seeing. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and prefer to watch the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy, in fact, she thinks she looks more like a bitch than Daisy Duke. Those shorts she might as well not be wearing anything. And since when did American Pie have anything to do with the SHAME Dukes on them for putting that nasty line down there on having sex with a car. That alone should have gotten the film an R rating. The only good thing that can come out of it is a reunion movie with the originals. Leave all hope. So the people out there who went and saw the movie will see how it should have looked
