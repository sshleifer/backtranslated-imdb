It should be the most famous TV show in the world. This is probably an escape for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent that he younger brother. I hope this show is canceled and never spoken again, except in a negative use. Jim needs to retire or something. Please let them go. If I here a joke of this show I'm going to vomit and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. I'd rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a whole half hour of programming. I still do not understand why the show is still up and running. We all know deep down that we want to film our TV screens when we see Jim's face. In conclusion, no more please.
