... but this is not working and I'm surprised to see how many people consider it good. Why? There are some loose tips here and there, but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch's films are usually intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are a lot of fun in doing so. There is some visual sense, there are some subplots, characters, ideas etc. But this is monotonous and yes, meaningless. Because whatever exists to exploit is either "small," or exaggerated or simply said before in a superior way. It's just Lynch exploiting DV, nothing more, so it should be treated like that. 1/10
