This movie smells bad! You will want to go back the extra two hours it takes to get through this. Sliding Doors, with Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda and Melinda try to do much better. This movie was clever, witty and well-played. I cared about what happened to the two Gwyenths - or rather, the characters she played - and the supporting cast performances were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Where Melinda and Melinda are tiresome, the dialogue is invented and I could have cared less about any of these people - least of all Melinda. A Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10 in the morning - and so melodramatic that she is laughable, not in the comic sense. The second Melinda is good, but forgettable. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's previous films worked because, I think, he spent time on the script and the actors were talented. One of the curiosities for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months: you can say. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented - those around her are not, not enough to be a complete presence. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a lot of other people you know in other movies but can not remember which ones. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
