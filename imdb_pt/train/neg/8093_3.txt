Based on Tom Wolfe's satirical novel that was praised by everyone (I still have not read it) Tom Hanks star as a beggar who accidentally kills a black boy while he is lost in a bad part of Willis's stars in NYC as the reporter who starts Hanks in their downward spiral .. The characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there are not too many laughs too ... Melanie Griffith had her breasts done while filming, so a fun thing to do is to see if her breasts change size during different parts of the movie .. This will keep your mind off of other things such as lack of script or humor .. On a scale of one to ten.
