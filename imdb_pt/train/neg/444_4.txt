(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about heroic women in the German Nazi era. But it's too long, not touching and sometimes boring! There are many cliches and there is no good acting. <br /> <br /> Storytelling is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic, an elderly woman remembers the events of her life. Well, now we have a point of view. Than there is another woman introduced who does the same. Confusing is that they are both remembering events in other people's lives! Let's go! This is a lack of knowledge of basic stories ... How can Riemann know about the fate of the girl's mother and her interrogation, for example? <br /> <br /> The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, the scene in which Riemann is proposing to Fabian. When did this happen? The scene seems to be in the 1920's ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is, of course, a talented pianist, well, she's even a Baroness! Wow. His brother returns from the Eastern Front, he received a "Ritterkreuz" which he is showing in some scenes. So he's a war hero and still a good man who has preserved his conscience. And he gained knowledge of massacres committed by Germans. He even made some pictures! And so it goes, cliché after the cliché is piling up and that's why the movie does not work. <br /> <br /> Basically von Trotta made a girl movie of something that could have been a decent movie. And in the end everything is very simple. Riemann finds a way to put Goebbels on the bed and - ta da! Everyone is free. That is not a historical fact, but pure imagination, despite the claim of "true history" in the beginning. How "Sass" is loosely based on a true event. <br /> <br /> It's sad, but true, this is the typical German movie these days. This is bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
