I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people sit and watch this crap? Okay, my dad and mom both love it, lol, but I'm sure I'm well out of the room before it happens. It's so depressing and sad, but the worst thing about it is the acting that I can not stand every detective show like this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programs with a real mystery? I mean, who wants to know what happened to fictional characters that we do not know anything about it died over 20 years ago ??? I wish the BBC put more comedy on bbc1 because now with the dibley vicar finished, there's more room for crap like that.
