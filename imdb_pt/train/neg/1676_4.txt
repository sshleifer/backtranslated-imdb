Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very exciting actors giving decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Infamous for his successful skills, a drug addict and a guy who, despite contracting AIDS, continued to make adult movies, simply does not make an intriguing character. <br /> <br /> The story involves the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 1980s in Los Angeles, to which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and who finally was acquitted. As in the case of OJ, the factor blame, regardless of the outcome, varied quite high in the zone "He did it". <br /> <br /> There is no one to sympathize with in this movie, as everyone is a selfish criminal. There is nothing remotely interesting here.
