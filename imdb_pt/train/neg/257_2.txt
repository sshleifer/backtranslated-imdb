I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I like 99% of all the movies I see. <br /> <br /> And I got out of this. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit, it may have something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of the theater who laughed at every little thing ("Oh no, Jamie is knocking on a door ! HEE HEE HEE! "), But .. this was incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained camera photo, and no camera taken from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in his face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad guy tried to be gentle and Malkovich-like, but at this point, he is just old and tired. He did not bring anything new or interesting. Of all the characters, many lines you've seen coming, many you've heard before, and many lines of "tough guys" ... and I do not care about that kind of thing, actually, as long as there's a bit of originality for this. In fact, virtually the entire cast of support was eventually sucked. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he's very funny, and I thought he was funny in that movie ... but it's not funny enough for me to put up with anything else. <br /> <br /> This film needed fewer photos taken, less emotion, more emotion, more sensations and more Jamie Foxx. I gave a 2.
