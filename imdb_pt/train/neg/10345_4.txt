In 1941, Columbia was a large studio and could produce a film with the same technical refinement as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing that could be said about "Adam Had Four Sons", a heavy novel with almost insipid performances of Ingrid Bergman (first time in an American film) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchwoman (it was the time when Hollywood thought a foreign accent was as good as another) hired as a housekeeper for Baxter's four children and staying (with an interruption caused by the stock market crash of 1907) to the boys grown men serving in World War I. Just about everyone in the movie is so good-well is it a relief when Susan Hayward as the villain enters the middle of the path ?? she is the only watchable person in the film, although she is clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; is also the first in his long succession of alcoholic roles? but the script continues to be saccharine and the ending is totally absurd. No wonder Bergman has refused the same "Valley of Decision," plotted four years later.
