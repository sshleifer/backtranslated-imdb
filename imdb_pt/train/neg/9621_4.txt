I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster and I guessed it had to be the best satire of all time. What a brilliant idea for a satire - the genre is plentiful. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think everyone involved probably realizes) is a catalog of missed opportunities, not very good performances and (thankfully!) Some extremely hilarious and inspirational pieces. Janeane Garafolo, who is very striking, looks very badly here, probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her paper plane funny. David Hyde Pierce is sad to watch, trying to be funny and looking like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny just to see that she makes you laugh, but somehow her segment does not turn into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teenage mannerisms and was sexy as hell, the other guys are also very funny (the nerds). I think the problem is that the director simply does not move things at the right pace. It starts very impassive, and that defines the monotonous tone. But when he gets things really scandalous (the drug series is the second funniest moment I've had all year in the movies, the first one also coming in a lame movie: Andrea Martin on ALL INDIVIDUALS complaining about the movie IN & OUT ) is simply funny. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just did not work out. The clothes and style for 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, and the few songs used are also perfect. This ends up as a MAD episode, which is kind of bad, complete with frustratingly long sketches.
