I saw this movie and sometimes I was unnerved believing that this movie "saw me". Munchie spoils 'farce' for years to come. Go back to watching Star Wars, do not watch Munchie. <br /> <br /> As responsible parent (I'm talking to those who are parents now), I (you) would not let my (my) child ever participate in this pseudo-hidden video festival. To insinuate Munchie is satanic, for a co-viewer, it is likely to ilicite a 'duh' frosty. He is diabolical, alien, rudimentary, and utterly malevolent - like the boogeyman made flesh, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without income made possible by years of self-denial and prudent stewardship). He is a peddler of easy answers and false ideals. He is all that the morally conscious spectator is not. He is Ron Popeil of the devil himself. <br /> <br /> I pray (literally and figuratively, with emphasis on the first) that this film has not made the format jump to the DVD. It is my hope that this kind of 'yellow movie' has died a not unfortunate death on the cold nights of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention that. This happens a lot.
