In 2004, I liked it. Then he was very stupid. This suggests that children do not have brains. This insults the children. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. He managed to be interesting and imaginative in his approach to children's programming. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 tablespoons of sugar in your Sprite. It seems like today's television producers are only interested in making money, instead of involving children's imagination and making money! Lately, my kids are tuning in to the old shows (60's) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, television looks back to the past and recycles the programming of children of old.
