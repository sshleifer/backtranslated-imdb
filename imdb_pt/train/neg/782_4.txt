Out of the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious idiot, his show is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing about Lopez has ever been funny. I noticed his stand-up and never expressed any resemblance to a chuckle. <br /> <br /> His material appears as vengeful and his animosity towards whites seeps through every pore of his body. <BR> I laughed at the white jokes of many comedians and I love many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a grudge that does not end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Hispanics who only have this show to perform. <br /> <br /> Concerts of shows are always cookie cutters with a Hispanic accent. Canned laugh at the most stupid comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> That may be why this show is always at 2 AM in the replay.
