If I could say it was better than Gymkata, at least I felt that my money was not totally lost. <br /> <br /> So I saw Steven Segal's On Deadly Ground movie. <br /> <br /> This movie should see a resurrection in the MST 3K. If Santa Claus conquers the Martians can blow the head of Tom Servo, one can imagine what the film could cause. <br /> <br /> There is good reason why Kurt Thomas has never had a film career. <br /> <The writers of this article should be forced to use posters every day of their lives that say "The whore beat me! I was a writer at Gymkata."
