I have to say the first one I watched this movie was about 6 years ago, and I really enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and on a second display I wondered why I liked it. The acting was horrible and, as usual, we have clan members stereotyped in their fake fantasies. The acting was horrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job, just like Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. <br /> <br /> The plot was good, but the execution was bad. I'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like that in the movies. Braveheart was even worse, which is just a saving grace. But seriously, people did not talk like that in those days, why do all the actors have Glasgow accents? Just one more film to try to capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I realize the only people here who say this movie is good are the Americans, and to be honest, I can see why they would like it, I know they have a passion for men in Kilts. However, if you are thinking of buying the DVD, I would say spend your money on something else like a better movie.
