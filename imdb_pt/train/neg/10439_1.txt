I'd like to think of myself as an open-minded guy and it takes a lot (!) So I do not like a movie, but this is undoubtedly one of the dirtiest and worst movies I've ever seen! <Br /> <br /> I have no idea what is wrong with people who have given such a good rating here (imdb is generally quite reliable when it comes to ratings) ... the only thing I can imagine is that people must have voted during one or more conditions: 1. Although they are plated / plated out of their minds 2. They received cash for vows 3. Under the gun's aim. > <br /> I can not believe I missed a good 1 h 45 min of my life so sorry pathetic for a movie.
