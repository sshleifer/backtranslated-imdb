This is really a horrible movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. It is both insipid and offensive, with nudity and much violence. However, nudity is not so exciting, and violence is repetitive and boring. Also, the plot is weak at best, the characters are unrealistic and underdeveloped, and acting is one of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this movie should be funny, but it's not. I did not laugh once while watching, did not even smile. The producers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie, and they failed on both counts. <br /> <br /> Some badly made movies are funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
