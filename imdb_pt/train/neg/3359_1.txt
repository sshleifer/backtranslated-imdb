They ruined this story! In the end, Nell is all heroic and accepts the team to save all her asses from Hill House and a bunch of nonsense like that! They added heads being cut, wires cutting people's faces and the ceiling turning into a giant hand! What the hell is this ??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I loved it! The reason the original movie and book are so good is because it scares you a lot without showing the ghost. There is no blood. There is no hand on the ceiling. It's just the ghost ad of how ghosts can actually kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not throw us into the room or stick a knife in our head. No. They can only drive us insane. Taking away all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She only wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little about others, but not much. David Self and Jan de Bont screwed up this great story! I hate this damn remake!
