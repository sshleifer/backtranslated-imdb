Chris, a foster son of a moral family, a loser who works in the school paper with Kate (Christine Lakin of ABC's untold TGIF's "Step by Step" program), finds out he's just inherited a porn empire from his parents biological. He loses sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah some other nonsense. He also has to deal with an uncle who wants control of the family business and a naughty lawyer (are not they?) A slightly below average teen comedy that steals from top teen comedies (the opening is HIGHLY Americana Pie-esquire), (Wayne Newton, Lin Shaye, and if I'm really stretching out the word star, Martin Starr from "Freaks and Geeks", and Justin Berfield from "Malcolm in the Middle"). It's not bad, but it's far from good. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: some extras go topless <br /> <br /> My Note: C- <br /> <br /> Where I've seen: Starz on Demand (available until September 29th )
