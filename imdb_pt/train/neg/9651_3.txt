The movie sucks. We have two good actors who are miscast and a meat chief of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story sucks. The characters are poorly sketched. Storytelling non-existent. No editing to speak of. Ajay Devgan as a rock star ... this is a dream in itself. The movie drags itself to the point of decay. The whole riddle about Arjun bringing his manna to London, letting him palpate his girlfriend and letting him not play at Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan's excessive acting or pretense is too painful to watch. I remember seeing good films of this Vipul Shah Producer, but this is not one of them. It seems like all good directors are falling prey to the box office craze. That Mumbai media leaders have created. This is another shitty movie on the lines of "Wanted," with an idiot actor like Salman Khan, who has no place in a good Hindi movie. He is good for Indian cinema as Titanic went for the winter cruise business. On a positive note, I like Asin's character dancing Bharatnatyam when she switches to the western dancing style when the teacher is not looking.
