I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's actually funny in a decent way. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely terrible, that is, he simply can not act, period. He should quit now, since acting clearly is not his thing. Their co-stars are of the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous .. Somehow, I do not think an Oscar is in the cards for this guy. <br /> <br /> I never wrote a comment about IMDb, but this movie was so bad that I felt compelled to do so. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, not 0/10 if there was a 0
