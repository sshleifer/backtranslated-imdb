First, I'm not going to tell you why I rented this movie, as I'm still confused ... Air Rage is very much like any movie I've seen where a plane is hijacked. There is, of course, an important person on the plane and the kidnapper looking for revenge. The sad thing is that some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies. Are we really becoming so little original so quickly? <br /> <br /> Although it is Ice-T (which for some unintelligible reason makes painful attempts to ACT while it is not busy putting the "c" back in front of rap) that is glorified on the cover, the movie really starred unless surprising Kim Oja as a flight attendant who is "surprisingly" venerated by the five hijackers, who naturally come back to haunt them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I could recognize was Steve Hytner, better known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld." <br /> <br /> I can not forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie when a hijacker used a PLASTIQUE bomb to blow up a door ... BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> The script - atrocious. It got to the point where I could say something, which I thought would make a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> As for special effects ... the only special thing about this movie is that I lost the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - the film DID happened on the air. But due to less than stellar performances, the only Rage in the movie was that of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood to even choose a movie, just because it's bad. Please save yourself, do not pick this.
