Edmund Naughton's book, "McCabe," by Robert Altman, was neglected at the time of its release, but in recent years has gained a critical ground. In addition to a completely convincing city-boom scenario, the characters here do not deserve much interest, and the image seems (intentionally) salty and unpleasant. The Bearded Warren Beatty portrays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles into a troubled community in the vicinity of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits begin to arrive, Beatty is naturally threatened by city bullies who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the film, which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this small town is limited - most of the story is composed of vignettes - and Altman's rhythm is deliberately slow. There is almost no statement being made (exactly the opposite, in fact) and languid actors look at each other without much in their minds. It is a self-destructive image and yet, in a peculiar way, it proudly uses defeat. ** in ****
