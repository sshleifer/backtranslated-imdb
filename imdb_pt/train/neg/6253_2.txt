It is not a very good movie, but according to the information, it is very necessary to describe techniques of torture. The aim of the film was to show the brutality of NK prisoner of war camps and this is done with sufficient efficiency, with surprising frankness for the time. Whatever the technical flaws (and there are many) watching this you will see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some very unpleasant things - again, unpleasant because it is being done north of the DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay. <BR> I do not think any of the Korean veterans brought their torture when they were running for office, and if you watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill, compared to the Vietnam movies. I do not know if it was the people in 54 prey in the concepts of World War II (boys tend to make jokes) or war or what, but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years later would be making films like "Go Tell The Spartans ".
