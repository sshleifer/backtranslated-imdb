Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies that I want to see out there ... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and that's what he wanted - Yeah ... <br /> <br /> I used watching this show when I was in college ... it was careless, kind of fun and a bit action-oriented. The show had a good heart tho ... and the characters were cute; no one was ever killed or hurt very much ... it was like a cartoon coming to life. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? This does not work. As others have said, there simply is not a cohesive story and the performances are strange ... almost annoying - they definitely are not loyal to the original characters ... the whole thing is like a Mad TV skit and lasts over 100 minutes! This was one of the few times I've been EMBARGOED watching a movie. What were they thinking? The best I can say, must have been for the marketing of products, toys, etc. All I can say is, let this die quickly. That makes the original Dukes of Hazzard look like the Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think the only remaining remake of the TV is Gilligan's Island ... Good luck!
