<br /> <br /> I recently saw this atrocity on my movie show, and I thought it was awful, as I said in my slogan, it was pretentious, banal, stingy and phenomenally self-important. <br /> <I consider myself a fan of films and all the things the film has to offer. If I want to watch a documentary about the Cannes Film Festival, I will watch A & E ... and they would probably be more objective about it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
