The original was a good movie. I bought it on tape and watched it several times. And although I know sequences are not as good as the originals, I certainly was not expecting such a bomb. The novel was flat, the sight old gags, the humor spoken simply was not. This may not have been the worst movie I've ever seen, but it comes close.
