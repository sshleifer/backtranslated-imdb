This movie probably had some potential for something; my perplexity is how these absolutely prosaic dull themes keep coming to theaters, it's as if ideas are being recycled just because the generations are. The real idiots of most movies are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. Well, they're 19 richer dollars now because of me. This was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), the performances were tense (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What was supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a tendency toward the Disney films; none of their analogies came home, their little moral speeches were flat, I was literally hoping they would continue to say something meaningful, only to find that it was ready. The so-called "hard 10" is the most insipid plastic creature that exists (besides having a horse face with a strange smile); I honestly found your friend Patty (known as Hamburglar) much prettier than her. But again, you prefer brunettes;) Well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial, and if love is true, it transcends all social facades; the way they showed it, with one face scraping the scrotum of another and the premature ejaculation routine of millions of times mutilated and beaten to death (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latest in the disgusting scene involving the family dog). I feel like the movie is like telling ridiculous jokes on a raw, formless sewage ball. Will show marketing can push anything out there, shine any stinking mass and call it gold, people will come (it worked for me). Done with roll.
