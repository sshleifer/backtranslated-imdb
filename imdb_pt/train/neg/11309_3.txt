Bad plot (though good for a B movie), good fight scenes at a brisk pace, at most 5 out of 10. But something always bothered me about this movie: how does Mariska Hargitay never talk? In the TV version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. Still in the regular version (video), most of her scenes are cut and she never says anything. This bothers me because it not only takes a female (though clich√©) view of the movie, but also makes the final shot look scary. This movie would have been better if they had kept their scenes, because in these scenes at least she has a personality, one that weakens whatever Speakman says.
