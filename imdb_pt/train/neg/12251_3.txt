Oh, CGI. A blessing when used correctly. A sin with him is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that is misused in this large piece of Jaws. <br /> <br /> Okay, anyone who has read any number of my reviews has noticed two things. 1: I like low budget horror movies. E 2: If there's a cute guy in the low-budget movie, I'll usually show them. So let's get this out of the way now. This is a low budget horror movie that I did not like. The acting, for the most part, is horrible, laughable effects, and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I've witnessed this year. As much as the handsome resident boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) wins this award hands down. This kid is hot! And amazingly, it's not just a toned body with beautiful eyes and a beautiful ass ... it can really act (well, as much as it can in this hateful movie). Now that we have the housework out of the way, let's move on. <br /> <br /> In the Cliff Notes version, here's the story (do not worry, I'll try not to give anything) ... <br /> <br /> A film crew travels to a remote island to filming a documentary about two surfers (the cute fluffy boy and his friend) who surf with sharks. Unknown to them is a large saltwater crocodile lurking around the island. Croc appears, chaos ensues and people are eaten. Roll final credits. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this movie practically blows. It all started off very well, but it turned out to be silly and stupid. A main character becomes a lunch (in a humorous way), and our remaining heroes utter phrases of effect at the expense of the victims. Also, if this crocodile is at the top of the food chain, both on land and in water, what about all the sharks around? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat, I do not think some tiny sharks would be around. The FX is one of the worst I've ever had the dislike to see. The CGI is awful, and they still managed to ruin the animatronic crocodiles. Attention, filmmakers. National Geography. Discovery Store. The Croc Hunter. They know how crocodiles are. You obviously did not mention any of these judgments because of the monstrosity seen at the end of the movie. And what about the gang of pirate / drug dealers? Do you just need another reason to tear off a woman's top? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we got small sub-genres in the movie world. With Alligator and its sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile and now Blood Surf, it now looks like full-length movies like crocodile / alligator should now have their own category in Blockbuster. Alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Tobe Hooper's Crocodile was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My note: D-
