This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever, I emphasize, already done. The worst is that my old hero, Dolph, is in it and he's starring. Jesus ... The story is really good, but the way it's done made my body ache. The fight scenes for beginners are as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks sneaking into the gutter. The actors, with the exception of Dolph, who also sucks, do so poorly that they can not help wondering if the reason they are there is that they are all friends of the director, who by the way must have been more absent, if not all. time. This is 12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because by the appearance of the effects and scenario, the cost may not be a penny above 1000.
