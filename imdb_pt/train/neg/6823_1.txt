I should have trusted my instincts better: no expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a masterpiece similar to Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and I was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is, in my humble opinion, nothing more than a cheap attempt to profit from the cult success of his predecessor, and - artistically - fail miserably. It seems that some producer collected the remaining material from Koyaanisqatsi, hastily thrown everything together, put everything in slow motion and got some pop artist under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hastily join some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with quick and slow smart changes, Powaqqatsi is a long sequence of mundane slow-motion images (if you view them on your VCR in Quick View mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was the soundtrack of Philip Glass. I could not - and still can not - believe that these New Age-type drones, which could easily have been composed in an afternoon by any 14-year-old girl on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who brilliantly composed the music emotionally and perfectly synchronized to Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a great waste of time! My advice: Forget the commercialism! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again instead!
