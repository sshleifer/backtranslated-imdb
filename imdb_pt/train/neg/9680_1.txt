Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying to deliberately offend his viewers. This movie begins with incest - and without purpose, meaningless, casual incest. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers living room tricks to hatch on to actually do something meaningful. Technical skill is not enough. He is only a little wicked because of wickedness.
