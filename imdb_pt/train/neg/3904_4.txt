I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the only great novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest. <br /> <br /> The comparison with the version of Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable - this version is much more Faithful to the spirit of the book and much more enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Here are some good elements - Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste at Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is beautiful, but the interiors are very dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are several important problems. The first is Mark Strong - first, it does not look right to Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role as a Victorian parish censor. It's very out of tune. <br /> <br /> The second problem is of duration. Simply put, the film is too short - to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long. <br /> <br /> Finally, and more significantly, there is the quality of adaptation. Austen is the dream of an adapter - the whole dialogue is already there. It just needs to be removed and organized properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather somber movie, and the last thing Emma should be is bleak. More significantly, Davies thought it wise to rewrite the ending as a kind of bucolic party. What planet, or lesser work of Thomas Hardy, is that? It is completely out of style and spirit of romance. And I believe it is extremely presumptuous to try to make improvements - perfection. <br /> <br /> Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate at Cold Comfort Farm.
