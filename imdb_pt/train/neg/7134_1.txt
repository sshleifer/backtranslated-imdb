So it came to that. Fast and expensive cars that only the top 1% will drive. The girls who pose beside them in specialized magazines. Second and unnamed actors. Cheap promotional appearances by people of the niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the trash Hollywood has to offer. Do not misunderstand me; I love the stupid action movie with hotties as much as the next guy. But please, will the Braintrust collective give these things green, please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty "Woooooosaaaaaah," then go back twenty-five years and remember what made the movies fun once? So really make some movies like that again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the whole explosion of pop culture in the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother think their Maverick now (even though half of them will not even get that reference). One executive said, "Hey, what demographics do you want to steal $ 9.50?" "I know, sir, the market 18-35." "Okay, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Brilliant idea, sir." The result? A movie I watched a hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and most of the time, starring Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now do not get me wrong, I'm not a movie snob. Exaggerated artistic manipulations like The English Patient do not float on my boat, but generic movies that should not have been made directly to the DVD bother me too much. Only teenage gears will have their engines accelerated, and I imagine those at the top of their IQ range will see that for what it is: a junkyard.
