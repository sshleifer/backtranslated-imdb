When you choose a movie that I hope will be a factor you consider, do movie actors use their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement, it is a moral issue that the effects are society. When a comedian / actor makes sexual and racist comments about a teenager and his father, we should ask ourselves (I want to support this behavior)? In this case, the behavior of Mr. Foxx tears the social fabric that teaches our youth from wrong, good behavior and evil that loving kindness is better than hate. Mr. Foxx must remember that it is just entertainment and there is a lot of it for us to choose. Saying sorry, do not take it off the hook. It will not undue the hurt nor remove the bad behavior it spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. I do not see anything else that they are part of. We can not change them, but we can stop the fame we give them.
