Ok, this is going to be a short sweet review ... Something the film should have led to a practice and made its life shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This movie is $ ^ @%. There is good reason for a petition with more than 40,000 signatures that required Uwe Boll to stop making franchise films that people liked. Rayne's blood being a big there. <br /> <br /> Jokes are good ... if you've never heard them a thousand times before. The acting is down, but you can only blame the script for it. Until a few moments I wonder if they are even using a script. <br /> <br /> The movie has little to NOTHING to do with the original games. HELLO, if you have ever played the games, you know that the main character has no real motivation outside the homicidal impulses such as mass murder because he broke his big toe or simulate. There's a lot of history for such a stupid movie. as I said. I would not even steal this movie. And for the person who says this is 'funniest movie of 2007' .......... need to take a look around, the news is better than that.
