Ever heard of a Taiwanese horror film? Or some Taiwanese movie? Probably for a reason. This was really annoying, even if it had black magic including drooping baby bodies and people exploding inside with thousands of eels. Having read the thoughts of other people, I was anxious for some violence. and gore, but not much at all. A little vomiting blood and other thighs, if you're hoping for graphic effects or any horrible effect, you'll be disappointed. They clearly did not use the exploding eel and other things to the fullest. <br /> <br /> Almost nothing good about this movie; a single character that was not completely dull and some black magic spells, like the one of the eel. The plot was confusing and annoying. The characters were fine and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect did not work, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (not so scary). This is the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
