My God. This movie was awful. I can not complain about that much. I went to see just to be rude. That was enough, more or less. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the beginning, where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby. <br /> <br /> I also find it funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the Hispanic soldier who was a supporting actor next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job. It was one of the worst performances I've ever paid to see. <br /> <br /> I also hoped it was much more horrible than the first. It was not. I expected it to be more horrifying because it is a sequel and sequels of horror movies are usually much less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more horrible since gore and violence often sell a horror movie nowadays (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, Dead Silence), but it was not really as horrible as the first movie, it was yet another disappointment. The mutants of the first kind were disturbing, but the filmmakers were trying so hard to make them scary that they were absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of showing the clip of the son of the female soldier on his camera-phone saying "I love you, Mommy" FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show this in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel worse for her showing three more times for no reason. This movie was a joke.
