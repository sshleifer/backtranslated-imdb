Years ago, a movie friend and I went to see a horror movie that we thought would be good because it starred John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was a three-time Oscar-nominated actor, screenwriter and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands) who wrote and directed a variety of low-budget films using his income as an actor to stay afloat. . Until we saw The Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes' income was made from any film that was offered to him. If we knew what the film was before we saw it, we could have avoided it altogether. But we did not go out. At the time, my friend and I jokingly indicated that it was the worst film ever made. Now frankly, this is not true. I've seen a lot of badly made movies on Friday nights at Cinemax (I just said it out loud?) Which are a lot worse than The Incubus. Almost any film starring Brian Bosworth is, by definition, a movie worse than The Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a worse movie than The Incubus. However, since then, I have consistently used The Incubus as a boundary below which I do not want to fall. When talking to this friend about a movie that I may have seen, I will always note that it was better (or worse) than The Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
