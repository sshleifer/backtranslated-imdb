Somewhere I read that this movie is supposed to be a comedy. after seeing, I would call everything but. the point of this film eludes me. the dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd, many of the scenarios seemed to be postreflective, and despite all nudity and implicit sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this movie ... all about letting me think about what the hell this is about! the premise of the title could have been the basis for a fun comedy (if politically incorrect). instead we are treated with cheap, amateur and unfinished sketches, and depravity and strangeness on their own. If I want this, I'll buy a free jones cd.
