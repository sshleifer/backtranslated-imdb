Despite some occasionally unique touches, such as the "virtual sets" that provide the backdrop to the Victorian interiors with Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film falls short and ends up disappointing. Newcomer Francesca Faridany looks talented but is wasted as Emmy, a character who in the middle of the film is reduced to nothing more than looking at a monitor watching Lady Ada narrate an autobiography. 'Conceiving Ada' takes off briefly when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; the camera persists in its facial expressions, mannerisms, even making it appear translucent or momentarily invisible, being used in scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" interpretation. <br /> <br /> A simple biopic of Ada Lovelace would have paid off, but this movie unfortunately makes a hash of the life of Lady Ada, and a modern computer scientist (and her well-befriended boyfriend).
