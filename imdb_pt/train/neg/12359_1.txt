I thought this was a truly horrible movie - I found myself actually screaming on my tv a few times. One or both male gay leaders were miscast; There was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo seemed to prefer to kiss a dog. The film covers her long and tortured courtship, highlighting every break and makeup but not developing the intermediate reasons in any detail. These reasons would create some interesting characters, not the fight or the makeup on the bed (lame, even if you liked the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine like their characters, but it does not make the movie worth renting. Save your money.
