I do not usually write comments, but I can not understand why this is so loud and wanted to give a warning to terror lovers, since I can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average TV watchers. <br /> <I only watched the first two episodes, but the two were so clichÃ©d that it was even funnier. the same old stories that you've probably seen / read a few times - live toys, bad things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, they are also bad versions of these cliches. I would prefer for example "chucky" and "silent hill" throughout these two episodes at any time. and neither ask about the visual effects ... those of the first episode are fine, but those of the second ... horrible. It looks like some movie student's project went awry. blood ... or blood ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> It may be interesting for a ten-year-old who probably has not yet seen / read many scary stories (although I prefer to recommend "beyond belief" - now is what I call a TV show mystery). but for an adult horror fan this is useless. I only gave the 3 points because there is, in fact, a beautiful cinematography (especially in the second episode) and a good performance.
