The subject is certainly convincing: a group of people take their love of the game a step further, creating a false medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. The war game is an interesting phenomenon that plunges into our collective need to "escape" from the reality and sometimes worldliness of our existence - something that almost everyone can relate to. The characters are the predictable mix of nerds from Lord of the Rings and Star Trek enthusiasts. That's enough to get most people to watch. However, very quickly, the film turns into a privileged view of war games with a near-stereotype of the nose for viewers who "do not understand." Filmmakers seem to take the subject of war games, and this one in particular, waaaaay very seriously, and not from time to time, recognizing the humor and fun in making a movie about drugged adults in medieval equipment and hitting each other with foam swords. It is very difficult for anyone who does not sit at their computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or designing the last destroyer of stars to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should care. However, the filmmakers themselves seem to care not to choose to focus solely on the theme of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand. Also, the characters themselves are not so appealing and you quickly get bored with them: a big no-no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
