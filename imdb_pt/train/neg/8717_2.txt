This is one of the most hilarious movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. <br /> <br /> I watched this on DVD with a bunch of friends on a Friday night and we could not stop laughing from start to finish. The story is quite simple: terrorists kidnap a convoy they think carries uranium for weapons, but actually carry a bunch of male-eating dinosaurs. An easy error to make. Cue a surprisingly incompetent Army Special Forces team to face the prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected the performance of 'Smell the fart', as advocated by Joey in Friends. There's a lot of horrible stuff and a lot of shots, but unfortunately Rance's team seems to have a problem targeting their weapons in the general direction of a horde of gigantic and heavy monsters. In addition, the lights always seem to flash and exit whenever a Velociraptor attacks (probably so we can not see how bad the creature's effects are). <br /> <br /> Having said all that, we all had a great fun betting on who was going to pluck their heads off then. As an action adventure in the Jusassic Park / Aliens style, this movie is worse than the crotch of a dinosaur, but it's ridiculous, ironic entertainment is a booming success.
