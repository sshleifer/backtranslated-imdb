It was the slogan "in the tradition of American Pie" that deceived me to rent this movie. What I got was a piece of junk in Jackass style, with the main difference being that compared to this Jackass, the movie seems to be a Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie regretted having rewarded other films with 1 of 10, because now I can not go below that. This movie makes some bad movies look like cinematic deeds. <br /> <br /> In fact, I turned it off after 45 minutes, and that's something I rarely do. But it was just too boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some people really reward this with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Let it fall on your head when you were just a child? Or was it the first movie you saw, so you have nothing to compare? Are you still a virgin and your breasts are all you think? Something must be wrong, at least. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from it. Even if you're in the mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else, or you'll definitely be sorry.
