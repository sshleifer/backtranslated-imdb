I had two reasons to watch that braggart when it aired on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I was not disappointed. She was beautiful. Secondly, through the reading of the film, I got the impression that it had an absurd humor, not unlike what can be found in the films of Philippe de Broca. For that reason, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (plus some witty remarks about the war theme) and the completely one-dimensional characters. In addition, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired way, with no sense of drama. I kept watching until the end, but I was bored very quickly and I sat there waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.
