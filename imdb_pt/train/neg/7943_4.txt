THE SEVENTH SIGN has a great opening hook when Israeli defense forces face a terrorist base. This is the kind of hook that is needed when writing a script, it catches the reader / audience and the introduction of David Bannon while he rents a room from Abby and Russell Quinnn telegrams to the point that this is a man who is not who he says it is. However, after the grand opening I found the rest of the film confusing and uninvolved with a large number of prisons and not so different from many other supernatural thrillers I've seen
