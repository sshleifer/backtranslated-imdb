This foolish, implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a police detective offers some almost audible lines confirming our greatest fears: He is dead. Perhaps the film had been saved if the director had given up the striking star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That an unnamed street hacker can save a movie of this kind is no less likely than a villain committing a murder by throwing stones in a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. Your moment is brief; Your promise is immense. Perhaps we will be treated with more screen time by this obscure actor if there is ever a sequel to this reckless movie.
