This is the perfect example of something great going really bad ... so can I advise anyone to watch it? well, I was half-thank-you for the fact that I was in the tiff competition (I still can not believe I won) .. and I just stayed until the end because the director was there for a q & a section..but that too was nothing but interesting .. what is it? Well, the first half (which is worth watching) features three characters: a prostitute, a musician and some kind of officer ... the first two lie about their professions ... but the third is the liar ... the second half (do something else..don't spoil a good night) includes some old breasts and heavy drinking..but maybe you will see this completely different ... the tiff jury did (were they drinking vodka?)
