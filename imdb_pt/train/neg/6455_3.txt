Really a terrible movie. It is to be expected, however. Clearly a low budget: nothing so innovative, an actress (if you can call what she does "to act"), who always has nude roles in a shower scene, a man in a backsuit almost modeled after predator, a cabin in the woods, etc. But there are some redeeming points. Although the story is not new, for the most part there are some parts that are not so regurgitated. On the one hand, the Negro does not die when he is attacked (for the first time) and is not even one of the first to die. But this is less. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist on the experiments of Kat and Wes & Steve that I did not see coming. When Steve told Kat that he knew what she did, I believed what he said and what Kat replied. But when the creature revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of the revelation. It may be because of my lack of experience with the genre, or that it is a genuinely clever twist. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is really bad and does not watch if there is something better in it ... Unless you're in the mood for a cheap science fiction movie.
