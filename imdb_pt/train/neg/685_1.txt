My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the movie would have to be worth watching. We were wrong. In fact, we gave it up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young, and Tone are British, but speak with an American accent, was, for me, impossible to pass - it is hard to believe that this is England when no one speaks in a British accent. There is no chemistry between Crawford and anyone else, and in echoing an earlier comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for each other without any reason is ridiculous. There's no reason to worry about any of the characters, and that's why we throw the towel in half. I found it hard to believe that Hawks was directing this, since none of the actors spoke with Hawksian rat-a-tat delivery. So save your time and skip this one.
