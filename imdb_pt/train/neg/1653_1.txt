It seems strange that someone has read this script and thought, "That's funny! I mean, it's so hilarious that it just needs to be done!" Who was this person? Is he or she really responsible for this? Are they the ones who owe me for my time, more than the director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks in almost every way possible. There is not a fair bit of dialogue, not a nice character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer Hulk Hogan's second-worst all-time movie, No Hold's Barred, to a considerable degree. It seems almost Shakespearen in comparison. <br /> <br /> The end is filled with several minutes of outtakes, and it is still less than 80 minutes. Outtakes include cast members laughing at the "hilarious" mistakes they made, and things that went wrong on the set of this "comedy." I'm glad to see someone laughing in some way, with some connection to this 'movie'. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is funny. Anything. Just go on and on. It is truly this lame. I love movies that are so bad they are good. This is so bad it is ... something, but I do not know what, and I hope you never find out. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet does not suck, and is actually the only good thing about this wannabe movie. But, that really means little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
