Oh, dear sir ... They have turned what was a rather instigating film into a testosterone festival. The original 1971 version of this movie was wonderfully vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of customers? We are not sure. <br /> <br /> We had some flashbacks that gave us the image that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he's spent his whole life trying to get to the vanishing point. That spot you see in the distance, where the left and right shoulders of the road come together, and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free and does not mean evil to anyone. We saw him several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops who were chasing him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his quest, he took his life. instead of being arrested and living a life of captivity. He died as he lived, wide open. <br /> <br /> In remake, Kowalski has a whole story (including a first name, even.) He's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband and excited expectant father. He makes the decision to take his life after hearing that his wife died in childbirth, but they even leave it in question when they suggest he may have jumped out of the car before bumping into the tractors. They even played the role of "super soul," the blind DJ (brilliantly portrayed by Clevon Little in the original) for JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!?! Give me some time.
