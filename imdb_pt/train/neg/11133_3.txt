Except for the best acting skills of the two protagonists, this movie is really bad. Cheap production figures do not help. Of course, you would not really notice that production values ​​are cheap if they did not keep trying to convince them that they had a production value to begin with. Even for a weird B movie genre like me, this movie really sucks.
