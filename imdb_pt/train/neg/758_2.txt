This show smells bad. For parents, they usually want their children to see something good for them. It is usually educational, fun and brilliant. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No. Doodlebops sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they do not try to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? No. Doodlebops say something that is not a joke, and laugh at it. <br /> <br /> Is it brilliant? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as color is concerned, everything is extremely bright, which is good. But NOTHING is wrong in the Doodlebop world. So they are always happy. a struggling child will be depressed because they have never been exposed to sadness. <br /> <br /> The show is also extremely extravagant. Each syllable is dictated to the highest level of exaggeration and very tacky. It's an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> For children, it's fun, but after 2 years you will not want your children to see you. They will never know how to grow.
