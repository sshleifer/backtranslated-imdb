I'm a big fan of movies. I like movies of all kinds. This is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I understand that it follows the book closely, which raises the point that not everything should be done in a movie. Especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book has been called into question more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are not peculiar, they are mentally sick. Things that happen are not funny, they are disturbing; especially considering that they must be true. <br /> <br /> This movie had the feel of The Royal Tenenbaums, another movie I hated, but Running With Scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny. <br /> I'll never get those hours back. I wanted to wash my brain after watching.
