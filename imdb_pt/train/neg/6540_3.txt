I can not believe that so many are comparing this movie to that of Argento. Your work is much more imaginative and vicious - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply does not have the ability to build real tension. The murder scenes - and let's face it, that's what this genre is - are not interesting. It was not difficult to guess who the killer was, and I did not really care when it was revealed. Cinematography is not memorable, and the highly praised Gothic atmosphere of the nineteenth century simply did not appeal to me. Several of the actors are very good (especially the director and the sadistic girl who dominates the younger students), but they do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but surprisingly, they add very little seasoning or suspense. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
