I just saw this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see you just because of Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel like I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend that it was the last time we were going to see a movie just because a certain actor / actress is in it. I hope she learned her lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her place. As for me, since I've paid, I wanted to see at least the end, just in the hope that something good would come out, but I did not hold my breath, and fortunately because I would have been a victim of the movie the same way. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white movie, it's black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are portrayed as hard and irreducible criminals and the bad guys among them were really bad. It speaks of a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical American phobia. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere's acting was good as usual, but the blonde girl who was supposed to replace him was insatiable at best. Totally unconvincing for the job. <br /> <br /> The film tries to explore a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic and sensational turn that is just unreal. They only use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murder, beating vigilantes, rape and torture - something that almost seems gratuitous. They even have a wolf attacking the people in the movie - how low you can get. <br /> <br /> I understand that the movie will not go out in the US and goes straight to the DVD. That should have stayed in other countries too, but because it's Hollywood and Richard Gere they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie is not worth a B movie.
