Three short stories are told in this film, which seemed to have been filmed without the knowledge of this being a combined vignette film. The creators report the three vignettes, connecting Martin Kove, though you never see some of the protagonists with Kove. <br /> <br /> The first vignette has a sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman afraid of everything sun (she makes Adrian Monk look brave), having a night of paranoia at home alone. You will literally yell at Vivian for doing some ridiculous things. She spends most of the time in a nighty that shows off her amazing features. But her movie is the worst, if not the most captivating. <br /> <br /> The second vignette is owned by Bill Paxton, while portraying Inferno's roommate. Your roommate geek allows you to take full advantage of it, and Bill does it whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette was funny as a man fears death take him at any moment, much like his friend. who suffocated to death in an olive. <br /> <br /> It's not very interesting, because the film as a whole seems cut together with very little reflection involved. A must for fans of Bill Paxton.
