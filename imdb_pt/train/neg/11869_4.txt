I do not know if the problem I had with this movie is that I could not capture the way the films were made in the past, but I believe that it did not fail to make use of any of the fashion conventions available in the market. the 40's to make a movie. If you have nothing better to do my advice is not to watch this movie but to read a book or go out for a walk.
