"They are among us" is bad science fiction at best. Mediocre acting atole this movie. The plot holes are numerous. Aliens who somehow came to Earth on a meteor and have been hiding between us for over 100 years, but they need a plastic surgeon to look human. In their alien form, they supposedly have exo-skeletons (and that's why they need plastic surgery), but when you see them they have teeth and nails. The heroine's father "disappeared" after Project Blue Book closed, but was supposed to be an F-16 pilot. And so on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, choose "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and see how this is done correctly.
