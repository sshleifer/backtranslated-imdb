As a premise, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm story was promising. <br /> <br /> However, director Eric Red's inability to provoke a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and enlightenment errors. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the viewer is more fascinated by the bizarre climatic effects than the intended plot. Intermittent waves of over-steering are equally disturbing. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, doing a hardwood backwoods schtick, does his best to save the movie. But finally, Undertow screams like a pig ... and has more ham to boot.
