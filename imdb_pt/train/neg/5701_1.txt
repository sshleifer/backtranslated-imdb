And so, the great rewriting of the story continues in Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> That was ridiculous rubbish. <br /> <br /> It's shocking to me that such an incredible amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most artificial, misunderstood, inaccurate film I've ever seen. It's shocking. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage's brief fling with serious acting seems to be over. I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a flaw in another litany of terrible movies. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance at Troy was not by chance, she really can not act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself for working with such nonsense. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for those who recover from a recent lobotomy or from an opinion the US has invented the world.
