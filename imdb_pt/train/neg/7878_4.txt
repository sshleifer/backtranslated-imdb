I'm a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is just plain bad. First of all, he had trouble deciding whether he is a small or adult child, which caused a strange mix of an adult story and some rather violent scenes with a silly duckling that continues to make "funny" moments in the beginning. but this is not important, the film is simply boring, immobile and not true to the original story. He simply can not transfer to the picture all the points Orwell tried to make in his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second revolution? !! Did not they learn anything? Who will be the next Napoleon then? Benjamin?!!
