Revenge of the Sith begins with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, so it gets really annoying for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the process is the slowness - and I mean, slowness - to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally comes, it's okay. Not good. Not even good. But that's okay. This movie is being highly praised because it does not suck the sky like the previous sequences. Instead, it is just turgid, monotonous, and routine. But you have to say, wow, these CGI environments are really impressive sometimes. But the lightsaber fights? They are all a blurry mess. I think the dark side caught Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank God it's over, this franchise that has already been venerated has been defeated enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after him, I overheard a group of very small children say, wow that was amazing! But everyone who was more than eight years old grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was kind of annoying. I just thought seeing the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So we all said.
