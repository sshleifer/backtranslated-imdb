I totally disagreed with the comments that said this is a good movie. This is a totally sucked movie. I mean SUCEDIDO - S.U.C.K.E.D. The development of the story is strange. Mia Kirshner has moved from an innocent girl to a fun girl in search of parties for no convincing reason. Also, all the actresses seemed too old to be college students - the college students looked like they were about 30 - you figure out the rest. I watched only the first ten minutes and began to move quickly to search for sex scenes. all the sex scenes are thighs, hurried and, most importantly, without fronts. All sex scenes are laughable, considering how many clothes they wore. Do yourself a favor - book and save a few bucks. Conclusion: History - 0, Sex - 0, Performance - 0, Score - 0 out 10.
