Think of a darker version of one of these children's programs as "Power Rangers" and you have this 1990 movie, "Robot Jox." A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and who leaves your country wins. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones that are shown, mostly because they are less colorful, so although this movie is not good, it's not that bad to watch. There are as I remember two robot fights in this, one that ends badly and in the final showdown. There is a twist in the plot since a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that will stay with you for any length of time after the picture is made. The fights look like giant toys in fury, but still a little fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a few other films with similar plot devices, such as the giant robots and the tournament. So worth checking once, but probably no more than that.
