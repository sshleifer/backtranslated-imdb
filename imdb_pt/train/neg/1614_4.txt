The second half of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary biography in Che Guevara is about his last campaign to export the revolution to Bolivia. In order to properly maintain his holy face of Che Soderbergh, skip the frogs of the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the madness of his adventure in Congo ("This is the story of a failure," he writes in the preface of your Congo Journal). to focus entirely on Che's attempt to get support to stand up against the government in Bolivia. It would be a disaster and the final act of Guevara. <br /> <br /> What tormented the first chapter follows the example here, while Soderbergh retards his film to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative Guevara being played again. like James Dean in eastern Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little success in winning converts and soon he and his starving companions are swallowed in the middle of the darkness of the Bolivian jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent, Aguirre, God's Wrath Soderbergh does not use the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle to increase the despair of the guerrillas. He seems more concerned about keeping Che's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic in the dead enders. There is a Herzogian moment in which Che sits riding a stubborn horse, kicking and screaming, but Soderbergh's general situation remains flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In both films, Soderbergh shows that he is clearly a Che groupie and because of that, his focus remains shortsighted and narrow. He spends a lot of time constructing his monument to Che and very little to develop his relations with the main actors of his saga, especially Fidel Castro. To make things worse, he does it with a slow, dispassionate approach that never sets fire. One would think he was steeped in Eisenstein and Vertov enough to realize that radical change is shown much better with sweeping style.
