Of course this happens in the west, but the title makes it look like a conventional western. Instead, it's a sheriff's wife movie. Make no mistake, although this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. She becomes sheriff when her husband is shot dead; she's just a little annoyed with that. Its main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Totally stupid, like anyone dead in this movie has the new sheriff to thank. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind the bars, but I think because she liked him, she would not do it. The killer is also behind the town's mayor for personal reasons who are also pretty dumb. This movie is very annoying and really not worth watching ... not one of the best episodes of MST3000 that they did. I can not imagine anyone seeing this without them, because that would make it much more painful. Corman is a low-budget director, but even he ought to know better than having people go in one place and out of another.
