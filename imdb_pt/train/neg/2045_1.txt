This movie must have been the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend were renting Zodiac (2007) and got this by accident. I thought it was a joke before the actual movie. that was terrible, I was waiting for him to become scary and never did. this movie had no real facts about the true killer of the Zodiac. The filmmakers clearly did not even bother to research anything about the murders ... they just liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about nothing faithful to its name. I'm upset, did not realize it was not the movie sooner. I try to like something from all the movies, I do not hate movies ... ever ... except this one. If you could have given no stars, I definitely would have. 1 out of 10.
