I had the misfortune to watch every 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shockingly bad movie. It fails on virtually every level; the cast is awful, the performance - ham at best and the plot has no depth, leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the complicated plots. <br /> <br /> Plan B has nothing of charm. This genre has the scope to broadcast and I found myself physically shrinking at various points where the script makes its regular meanderings poorly appraised anywhere for the comedy region. <br /> <br /> A genuine saccharine-coated manure from a film.
