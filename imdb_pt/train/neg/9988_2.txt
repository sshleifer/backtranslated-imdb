Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, whose life is good until an ex appears and things get a little complicated. While I watched this movie, several times I wondered why doing so .. because the film is so ridiculous and blah and badly scripted without any credibility. Not even the public really knows what happens ... Even the lovely Cameron can not save this on a scale of one to ten.
