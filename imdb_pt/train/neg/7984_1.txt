Many secondary plot lines without a primary. Many hot buttons are pushed for no reason, they have managed to fill this annoying movie, which says nothing, with every element of drama that is out there: death, divorce, money problems, parental problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse , adoption, rejected love, travel problems, sex, misunderstandings of generations, robberies, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep real love"? You'd think that would make an interesting movie, but hell did not it? All these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super long) talk for the kid at the end of the movie is total nonsense. Pity <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention: the actors, all of them, are very good. That's what stopped me from turning it off. For evil, his talents were wasted. The film was also filmed: light, movement, etc. of all episodes - everything is in order. It's just the meaning that's missing.
