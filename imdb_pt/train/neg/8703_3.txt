Primitive Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists are surprised when their cargo ends up containing living dinosaurs. The army command team now has to think fast, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species, instead of the reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and get your first impressions of the movie. That's pretty much it. The acting is only acceptable by some characters. The story is poor, with all the film based on the army and the Marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This movie came out three years after 'Jurassic Park'. Instead, this movie seems to have come out 13 years before 'Jurassic Park'. The dinosaur costumes are so poorly made, and I mean fantasies. There are obviously people dressed up and this movie does not try to hide it. A scene in which a dinosaur runs along a corridor is created in a way, in which it seems that someone is riding the creature. It's a good thing coming out of this movie. The short run time. With only 1 hour and 15 minutes, he does not waste much of his life, but still tries to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> "It's like a Friday the 13th in the Nightmare." - Official (Brian Currie)
