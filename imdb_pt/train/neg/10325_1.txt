This series only gets worse and worse. Badly written and just is not funny! The premise is excellent, but the inexperience of the writer shines. By striving so hard not to offend anyone, they end up insulting everyone. Now, in season two, the desperate cast stopped waving their arms and resorted to this smug paternalistic style of "Oh, silly" that comes with a script without laughter. They rolled their eyes and nodded at each other as if to say: are not we crazy? Is not that funny? Well, no, it's not true. Gingivitis is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally shun Canadian TV. Let's CBC you should be our main station showing the best of Canadian talent. Pull the plug in this amateur mess.
