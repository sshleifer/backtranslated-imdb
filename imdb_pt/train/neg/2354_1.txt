I do not even want to call it a movie - it's a movie that should not have won any awards. The acting was horrible, just like the idiot scenarios. This is exactly the kind of movie that many people think meets an NRI audience but is actually hated abroad for its strangeness and the overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors familiar with the English language have such a difficult time doing this convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all those symbolic English phrases thrown in a movie, in Hindi and in the regional movie theater for cold spots. There are few Indian films in which English seems completely genuine - being Cyrus was recent. Although not a great movie, it was a good movie and the language did not seem "set up". <br /> <br /> I feel embarrassed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-nice parts of this junk were Konkana and a somewhat interesting background score. Other than that, do not waste your time on this movie.
