This movie is just awful. John Ritter pratt drops, 75% of the actors deliver their speeches as if they were reading them from suggestion cards, bad editing, horrible sound mixing (the dialogue is difficult to understand in places above the background noise), and a plot that really is not going anywhere I did not think I would say that, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers his speeches with the passion of Ben Stein. I began to wonder if she was not dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's children are terrible (the oldest one is definitely reading their lines from a suggestion card). This movie is seriously horrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich did not get another project until 4 years later. Please do not watch. If you see it on your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch you, you'd better find another soul mate. I'd rather rip my eyes out with lawn darts than sit on this piece of junk again. If I could summarize this movie in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
