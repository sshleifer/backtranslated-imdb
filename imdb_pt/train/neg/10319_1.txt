Unlike many, I do not find the premise or theme of this program the least offensive. Its execution, however, is entirely another matter. Like so many B-minus movies, all decent jokes seem to have been put in the trailers. For most of the twenty-two minutes or more, we sit in dwindling anticipation of any real mood. Or at least something to keep someone from touching the remote control or counting the carpet fibers. With some exceptions, the acting is horrible; the comical over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members may be well suited for an infomercial late at night, but not a primetime serial (even a Canadian.) Despite the admittedly original cultural angle, I can not help but think that this is especially one shot failed by CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they got the tone - and the script - completely wrong for the prairies. The final insult is that they apparently could not even have the location work done in a small, real city. (Why? Are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the public would be fooled by Regina's exterior? As a proud Canadian, I hope this thing disappears soon, and that the rest of the world, prepared by the CBC publicists, quickly forget this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.
