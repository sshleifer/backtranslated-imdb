Steven, what you did, you hit a new record. It's strange since Steven's last film, the shadow man was directed by the same director who made this crap. Shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it was not even funny Steven is hardly in the movie and it looks like he's in an appearance and when he's in the movie he's nicknamed half the time anyway. As for the action well let's say the wizard had more action than this junk there is hardly any action in the movie and when he finally arrives it is boring depressing seriously called action scenes. Seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his films in that he goes to an army of men, ie under siege 1 and 2 and get out of wounds. the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it does not make scenes at times. flight of fury better be good than sorry I wasted 5 pounds in this junk 0 out of ten better luck next time
