I saw the movie trailer several times in the theater and I cheered myself up. It looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990. I also remembered runaway movies, a cat-and-mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time. As I see, a lot of people say this is like a TV movie. Not exactly. Firstly, there are many more TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies can be very entertaining at times, but this movie is the exact opposite of having fun. It is not stylish at all visually and most importantly, the tone of the film is unpleasant. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes consisting of a chase and a confrontation. Also not great action scenes, but the worst thing is that these action scenes are very bland as the whole movie. The love affair between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. In addition, the assassination plan for the president is the most clich√© story in this genre, but they insist on it. And this is not a cat and mouse movie as it should be. Although Douglas is very old now, he still has the potential to play an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas can not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a wrong choice because you feel like you're watching Jack Bauer and somehow, your character is one of the reasons that make the movie like a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course she is very passive or straight in this movie because she is a novel actress. The movie was not a lot of fun for me, so I could not get over it for a while.
