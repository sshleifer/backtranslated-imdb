I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival 2005. Based on a novel by science fiction author Brian Aldiss, this movie tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, twins who are ripped from their family by an entrepreneur to form a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately puzzling, the movie is also very clever in half (if you forgive the pun). When mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha) lose track quickly. I was never sure if I should take everything seriously or not. Flashbacks, sequences of dreams, everything was a little too much. Also, the promised rock and roll simply did not move me. I remembered a little too much about Hedwig and Angry Inch, a film I found original and moving. But in this case, the songs were not so good, nor the main characters were friendly. A more unfavorable comparison would be the equally disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
