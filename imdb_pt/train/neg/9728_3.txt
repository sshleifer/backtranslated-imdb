Tobe Hooper made great movies, so I was sure that this could not be bad. I did not read any comments and tried to watch this movie without humorous intent. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes it made me almost scream for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I rated this 3/10 because its 1990 movie "horror" and many interesting or funny things happened. over there. Throughout the movie I was thinking of something like "they just CAN NOT add more stuff in this movie ..." .. but they did. <br /> <br /> Some say this is some kind of Firestarter clone, but it really is not. It's based on that idea, but that's all. This is a combination of horror, comedy, weird religion / god stuff, funny, simple effects, drama, horrible acting, unbelievable script ... and more. The story is: the government tries to create supreme weapon using nuclear power or something and fails, during the process the child is born to 2 test people. When the mother sings to her child after childbirth, both husband and wife burn and it is SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. The government buries the whole thing and lets this child live among other people and ... after age x this child is grown and realizes that he was born for a reason and that he can burn things with his brain. So everything gets unbelievable messy nothing really explains anything and .. Well, when the government realizes "well now it can set this thing from fire to work" they take it to the normal hospital where is some toxic nuclear that they will use in this man because they could kill him, no, they can not shoot him no! .. and argh, I think that's enough to say, I promise there are 100 strangest things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want good laughs, watch this one. Fuck.
