I saw this movie last week and it's silly and tasteless. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas? The victims are senseless and can not escape a slow moving man. They drop their torches and shake instead of trying to push it away or, duh, burn it. Quentin, by the way, Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster, also known as Miss Canfield, of the fame of Leave it to Beaver, who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love storyline. The rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and waits for the screams to react and rush to their aid. The Egyptian girl is not ugly but does not lend much to the film. Where's the mummy? Really just a curse triggered. That does not stop Universal Mummy movies from being played. Watch this movie if you need to sleep because it will heal.
