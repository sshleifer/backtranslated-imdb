The most misogynist movie of all time? Not to mention that in 1968 they should not have gone beyond the white-faced, white-faced people touching the "Indians"? My favorite parts have to be when the girls laugh and blush as the bikers drag them to rape gangs. Rape is fun! Who knows? Let's see, then there are the blatant snatches of "The Hustler" (fat boss character actually plays pool while conspiring to destroy the Indians with the main rebel face), the horrible performance, the guy-in-the-nose-they-could-like -Well-just-told-you-to-think music clues, the lack of ANYONE WHO'S REALLY Indian in this movie. And who should we be cheering? I have to say that figures that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Even though his films tend to defend strong women, I've heard from at least one source that in real life he's a misogynist idiot. Why did I watch, you ask? Do not ask.
