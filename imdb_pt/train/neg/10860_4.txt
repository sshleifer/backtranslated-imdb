This was a disappointing movie for me. It came to me through a box set titled "Classic Film Noir," which was a gift from someone who knows that I usually like movies made in that style (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre). I do not think it's a noir movie. There seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white B movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir, and the label does not always fit. There is a chased male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film's action takes place indoors. These are just the only noir elements I could see. There is no generalized paranoia, or any real reason why you should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was heavily dressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to ruin this movie for potential viewers. However, I would be interested to hear what other film connoisseurs noir have to say about it.
