Yes, I know I'm one of the few people who want to run this movie through the dust of oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel this way. In fact, if it had been advertised as a zombie movie or something, I might have liked that. But now, I'm totally speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Although I'm not sure what it is to ruin * Let's start with the first HUGE failure. If I did not know the movie is called "Darkness - The Vampire Version" and if I had not seen some sequences in which some individuals seem to be sucking blood, I would not have seen the connection with Vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! Second bad point: what's with Metal? It seems that all young people, but especially so-called "vampires", are in various types of metal, judging mainly by their shirts! Do not get me wrong, I've been in the most extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but no one is going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers on Iron Maiden (of all bands !!!). shirts running around pretending to be vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I could use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. What actors? You mean the director's wooden friends! Words would be a waste here. <br /> <br /> Yes, okay, the movie is very bloody, but what difference does it make? It would have been a strong point and something to appreciate if the "brilliant" director had not chosen to create an ARTIFICIAL Vampire theme in this film. I wanted to see Vampires, but I was treated to some stupid kids who would love to use my baseball bat. The filmmakers should have simply announced the movie by saying "cheap horror, without plot, but with a lot of blood." <br /> <br /> This film is a blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And that makes me sick.
