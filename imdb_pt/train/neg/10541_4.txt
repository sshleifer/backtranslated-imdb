I wrote down some notes here in Lou Lambada's Satanic serial killer Diamond Phillips' 1990 Yuppie Hell-Fest ... 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently indicted for beating his wife and can serving time in prison. I just hope he can find Armani jail clothes to go out in style with: One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is to see his police detective wearing $ 4500 coats, a $ 7300 silk suit, and seeing his US $ 3500 / month in Los Angeles. Single loft cushion with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) The main lady Tracey Phillips has dazzling porcelain skin, fluttering red hair that always looks styled even when unkempt, and incredible breasts that are lit in the second half of the film, by a silk pullover from brand, which unfortunately remains in her torso, even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed by Satan. At least in the 1970s, our demonic assassins undressed their victims before ending them, although there is something to be said to leave the imagination a little bit. In the final 10 minutes of the movie, all I could think of was what her breasts would probably be. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychics living in Los Angeles can rent a $ 4 million apartment on Mullholland Drive, overlooking Los Angeles. with a vision that would make Brad Pitt decide that he was thinning. In fact, the condo used in this movie looks exactly the same as seen in MULLHOLLAND DR., By David Lynch, who at least had the good sense to make the condo a successful movie director. The only psychic professionals I've encountered outside of this movie are currently serving jail sentences for electronic fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name, but the villain in this movie is wonderful, and his "How's it going?" Buddy Boy? "line could be the best forgotten phrase from the movie since" THANKS FOR THE RIDE, LADY !! "of CREEPSHOW 2. Underneath large metropolitan cities there are huge tanks of boiling acid that will explode in huge fireballs if someone throws a lighted Zippo lighter, which is why all the large public water mills have no sign of smoking stamped on them, although the idea of ​​smoking around water being dangerous is obviously absurd. And as Zippo lighters need to be filled manually with lighter fluid that can leak and to be absorbed by the clothes, the idea of ​​carrying one in the pocket of your $ 7300 Gucci silk suit seems to me much more dangerous. <br /> 6) The action scenes in this film are impressive to say the least, and one of the Fun things to watch it is to stay that you are not see of computer-aided special effects, but true stunts risking life and physical integrity to contribute a film that has gained almost universal ratings from critics when released. <br /> <br /> 7) movie Satanists always surprise me: here is a guy who took advantage of a Luciferian attempt to power, and yet, instead of using it to do something useful like becoming wealthy or doing with that fashion models engage in free sex with him, he, instead, owns purse lords and makes them levitate out of people's apartments. Speaking of which is a guy who is indestructible, he can fly, and is able to put his being inside the body of other people - and yet he obliges the star Lou Diamond Phillips with a common fight at the conclusion of the movie, does not yet have the Good sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to ensure he wins. <br /> <br /> And so on ... To be seen in the company of wise friends who break while sipping beer. You will have fun as long as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
