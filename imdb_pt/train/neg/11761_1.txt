Complete Drivel. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical and toxic culture of a decade ago. In this movie, pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts (the boring redhead who feeds Shaka rice?). Forget historical reality too. Did not most western slaves come from West Africa? An American slave easily capturing Shaka with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been more unpleasant. One can only ponder, how would he have done in the miniseries? (Promptly impaled most likely). The miniseries was excellent, and it's unfortunate that DH has taken their hands in something unique, and made it mundane. (I usually think he had a hand in creating this fiasco).
