This movie deserves more than a 1. But I'm giving it one because a lot of freaking kids gave it a 10, resulting in a rating that will take you to the top 100 list. Seriously, it's not so good that it's not so bad. It's an idiotic cult classic with so many fanatic kids that it's ridiculous. These are the guys who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and still say "I'm Rick James B! Tch". It does not matter how old or boring it is. I fear having to listen to "I'm tired of MFn snakes in this MFn plane" months from now on idiots trying to be funny. Its crap, crap acting, etc. Its OK to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the Marine starring John Cena if you want to see a real movie
