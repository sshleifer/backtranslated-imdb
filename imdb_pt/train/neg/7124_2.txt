A man brings his new wife to his home, where his ex-wife died of an "accident." Your new wife has just been released from an institution and is also very rich! Suddenly, she begins to hear noises and see skulls all over the place. Is she freaking out again or is she the first woman to come back from the dead? <br /> <br /> You've probably guessed the ending, so I will not spell. I've seen this many times on Saturday afternoon TV as a kid. At that time, I liked it, but I was young. Seeing now I realize how bad it is. It's horribly acted, poorly written, very annoying (even at one hour) and has a huge cast of FIVE people (one of them the director)! There are still some good things about it. <br /> <br /> The music is kind of creepy and the location itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is really nice. There are also some scary moments (I jumped a little when she first saw the skull) and a rather effective end. All in all definitely not a good movie ... but neither is a total disaster. He has a little cult following. I also give 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid editing the Elite DVD Drive-in (it is paired with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It is in TERRIBLE form with heels and scratches everywhere. It did not even look so bad on TV!
