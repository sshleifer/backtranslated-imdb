This is a poor movie by any standard. The story at Match Point had a certain intrigue, and the direction and a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic English murder and exploring what can be done with it). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however, does not have any of that. It is poorly written, the two leaders are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest whatsoever. The genre he forges requires at least some kind of subplot with witty explanations and tie-ups (why tarot cards and keys are kept under French horns in locked rooms?). <br /> <br /> The delightful and spirited versions of Allen's various Hollywood genres (Jade Scorpion Curse / Purple Rose of Cairo etc) have given us great pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great central idea. Unfortunately his inspiration left him this time.
