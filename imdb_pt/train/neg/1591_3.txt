After attending many of the Next Action Star reality shows, the TiVo eps series recorded that horrible nonsense for me. For some bizarre reason - and I have only myself to blame - I watched the whole thing, hoping there was * something * unique throughout the film. After so much fanfare about Joel Silver's "Midas Touch," with action movies, he may want to make sure he understands his alchemy. <br /> <br /> First, the only redeeming value of the entire film was Billy Zane, and even he could not get the excuse out of the article. That said, Zane's performance falters about 2/3 of the total, as he does not seem to know what to do other than seem convinced. <br /> <br /> I can not blame you here, though. The writing, frankly, sucked. Let's get ideas from "Rat Race," "State Enemy," "Terminator," "Midnight Run," and any bad movie you can think of and simply redo everything. And who is the brilliant idea of ​​having two chase sequences on a bridge? Sean Carrigan, the "man of the hour" from "The Next Star of Action" shows all the strengths and weaknesses of the cast directors mentioned throughout the run of the series. Johnny on one note, Sean plays the good-looking idiot athlete very well, but struggles with the weight of the film. Frankly, it seems we never mind if he lives or dies in the middle of the road, since Carrigan can not provide a reason for the public to like him. His change-but-luck routine ages as there really is nothing on the character to cheer. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wood, rigid Corinne Van Ryck of Groot. Did Howard really tell her to pretend to be an exterminator in the first half of the movie? I think not. I kept waiting for her to date Arnie. His "performance" character can be compared only to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered," though not as well developed. The camera loves her in dark and gloomy limos, but in the light of day her behavior sucks up all the energy of the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed a more natural life in her five-minute part of what Corinne showed in any part of her screen time. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Sean has the sturdy good looks to provide good lead in a cast, but should not have been left to make this solo. It was simply too big a task for him. "Next Action Star" comrade Jared Elliot may or may not have been luckier with some more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to say given Jeff Welch's script. Someone should take Welch's iMac out of it before he gets hurt or anyone else. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot was simply outdone and out of his reach, even for a complete shock like this. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
