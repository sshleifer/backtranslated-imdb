The problem is the role of the characters in the movie. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to Scotland and then realizing that they are not animals or subhumans but actually are equal to him. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet receive such a superficial and stereotyped role in the film ... The kidnapper (British anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film. film because he 'can' relate to the pygmies ... No notion of how the two hostages feel, from their point of view, their ordeal ... I think it is a superficial film with a fundamentally racist view. .. can never get away from the vision of the "white man"
