Oh what a condescending movie! Set in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers, this film attempts to be a deep social commentary on contemporary American angst. <br /> <br /> Stereotyped and crabby characters of varied socio-economic backgrounds. to cross paths in their everyday and monotonous lives. The plot is disjointed and disconnected. Several unimaginable plot plans keep the film, such as: a shooting, an abandoned baby left in the bush, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a boy in the summer camp. <br /> <br /> And through all these events, the only constant is the generous help of sociological insights conveyed through dialogue as the characters compare notes about their life experiences. One character tells the other, "When you sit on the edge of that thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we are people; ... these stones are laughing at me, I could say, me and my worries; very funny for the Grand Canyon ". <br /> <br /> And another character pontificates the meaning of everything: "There is an abyss in this country, a growing chasm between people who have things and people who dont is ... it is as if this great hole has opened on the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what comes pouring out ... is a rash of anger, and anger creates violence ... ". <br /> <br /> In addition to the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, beyond the superficial characters, beyond the stupid plot, the pace of the story is agonizingly slow. Acting is uninspired and superficial. The tone of the film is presumptuous and self-satisfied, in the scorn of the screenplay for the viewers. <br /> <br /> This was a film project approved by Hollywood suits that imagine themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking from top to bottom. They think the film will be a startling revelation for us, humble and ignorant cinema goers, eager to learn about the real meaning of American social change.
