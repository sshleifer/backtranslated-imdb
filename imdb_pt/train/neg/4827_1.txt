If this movie was meant to discourage people from using drugs, it will fail. I was ready to start using them. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing really happened. This movie is neither horror nor drama. It's just the paranoia of methamphetamine users. This movie can win a prize for the use of the word "F" so many times and so unnecessarily. It was not well said, but I felt that they were doing Meth to replace Meth that they owed to someone. Hector got worse and more paranoid as the movie continued and the girl became more desperate. The ending really did not make sense. The movie made no sense, unless it was just to show how annoying it is to get stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a methamphetamine head. I relied on the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie and the rating of this movie should be a much lower average.
