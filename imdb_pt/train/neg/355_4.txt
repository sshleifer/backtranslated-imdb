Just Cause is one of those movies that, at first, makes you wonder why it was so hard when you left - nothing special, but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get more and more silly until you have a killer with a flashlight tied in the forehead, threatening to film the wife of Sean Connery (a typical Kate Capshaw) and a boy (a young Scarlet Johannsen) . ) in an alligator hide shack. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie that is probably best seen on a plane and even then only once.
