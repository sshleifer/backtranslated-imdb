Pros: Nothing <br /> <br /> Cons: All <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: A reporter comes across a cartoonist telling his stories about the deaths of people killed by zombies. <Br/> Review: Never in my life have I come across such a bad movie as The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of what appears to be about $ 20, TZC is a completely horrifying horror movie that features lame, forgetful actors who could not act to save their lives and gore that is coarser than scary. How does a movie like this get made? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> My last two cents: Humorously, this movie was made by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. They are brains must have been really damaged to get to a sputum like this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it were up to me, this movie would have the negative bajillion rating)
