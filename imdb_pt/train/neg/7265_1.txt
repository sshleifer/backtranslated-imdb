I only saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs, unless you have sleep problems. It's a movie full of pretensions - it opens with a little quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it's all from there. Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story Line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles "The love I saw in you was just a mirage" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, but full of repetition. Because of the anesthetizing pain this movie ranks with the Methodist church seats that my parents dragged me when I was a kid. I want 2+ hours of my life reimbursed. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the exhibition with comments that the film was "controversial" - this is true only for the narcotic effect of the film.
