After watching about half of that movie, I noticed something peculiar ... I've seen myself constantly shifting through TV channels to see what else is happening - not exactly a good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is listed as being in various genres, and I must say that most misserably failed in each of them. 80% through the film I moved to watch an old rerun in its place. Bottom line - the whole movie looked like the producers did not know exactly what to do and ended up in a noticeably tasteless concoction.
