Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was watering. I dropped everything to watch this movie on Cable. 30 minutes when I was having trouble staying awake. 60 minutes and I pressed the record button and fell asleep. Just watched the next morning. You should not have bothered. What a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "Day in Life ..." cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I assure you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep. Horrible dialogue. Continuity non-existent. The camera work could have been done with a Super 8 handheld and looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
