There are some really incredible ideas in this violent movie that, if executed with clarity, could elevate you from the softness of the western Spaghetti to something special. Unfortunately, TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies imaginable! The scenes begin and end abruptly, the characters leave for long periods, the performances (and accents) of the actors are quite inconsistent, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican revolutionary (!) who, after participating in decimating a village, stands to become a priest (!) ... ten years later the village is being administered by "the mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives in search of revenge against the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau comes in search of Shaw. Everyone yells at each other VERY much and they all kill a LOT. Fernando Rey is also in him (like a blind man). The performances are not bad, but they are quite uneven. Savalas has an accent sometimes, just like Landau (which is really annoying here). Shaw and Rey prove they are incapable of really being ashamed and that Stevens looks really sexy (though a little out of place among the dirty dirt).
