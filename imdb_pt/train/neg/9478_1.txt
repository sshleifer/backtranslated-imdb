If there were some weird Oscar awards festival, this movie would win it all. It has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects along with extremely good acting skills and of course in all roles there is a celebrity superstar. Well, this could be the scenario if the world were reversed, but it is not. Instead, it's the worst horror movie ever made, not just the bad actors who seem to read the scripts of a teleprinter with poor dyslexia, but also extremely low in special effects. For example, the devil's fantasy (which by the way is a must see) is one of the most hilarious I have ever seen. Whenever I saw that red-black monster called on the screen I could not hold my laughter back. And on top of things, it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake I did. Checking out the IMDB, seeing that the movie was released in 2003, had less than five votes and thinking: - "Well, it's worth a shot, it can not be that bad." <br /> <br /> Yes, it could. <br /> I will not waste any more words on this film.
