I basically flipped through the movie, but just enough to watch the plot. To tell you the truth, it was kind of boring for me and in some ways it did not make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He's so good, but in that movie his hair was kind of weird. But still warm. <br /> <br /> However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the movie. I think the plot is not so bad, but what really threw me was the fact that they curse like every phrase. Is it so difficult to express your anger without saying the word "F" every time? The cursing was annoying and the whole flashy camera was shaking gave me a headache. <br /> <br /> All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film more annoying and dramatic. That's why I only create scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyway, it's not worth renting unless you're an unconditional fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yes, the cast was hot. The girls were HOT !!! But the CHACE IS THE BEST !!
