This is a candidate for the most disappointing movie experience of my life. Legal title, excellent director (I saw "To Die For" and "Drugstore Cowboy" before that), and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast. How can you go wrong? Well, that's a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after I watched that turkey. <br /> <br /> Disjointed and bland in an attempt to be unusual, this is a dead zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs. His review was well deserved. You have here one of those rare movies that does not contain a single quality of rescue. Zero out of ****.
