I've always been an enthusiast of period dramas, an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was unbelievable. Incredibly bad! The script was horrible, the acting uninspired and all the characters lamentably insipid. Apparently, Byron was "crazy and dangerous to know," and left the hearts of women agitated. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a small spout in bad taste rather than an inflamed hero of women and the Greek struggle for independence. They say Byron was limping. This picture of the man was all soft. <br /> <br /> I watched the two and a half hours waiting for something to lighten life. Not a grunt, not even a flash. It was absolute boredom, if not boredom, from beginning to end. Having the opinion that no one will improve the Bard of Avon, I also believe that Byron's poetry is revered and my mind should be thrown into the background, and this dramatization of his life should receive the same treatment . <br /> <br /> I think the BBC has lost its nous with this
