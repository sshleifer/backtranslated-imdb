I usually LIKE to watch the films of Burt Lancaster - especially when it is necessary to go crazy with his imposing screen presence as in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness, for he rarely, if ever, underestimated ANYTHING. And it's this lack of subtlety that really gets in the way of Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was to be a kind of showman, but as Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She must be smart, but it does not look like the Lancaster troublemaker is being played on the screen! Also, the story is perhaps one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and it's obvious that it's a one-piece movie. It looks like it was filmed mostly on a sound stage rather than in the great open west as it should be. <br /> <br /> Overall, an overrated movie.
