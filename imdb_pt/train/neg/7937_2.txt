After 30 seconds, you already realized that there was no real budget for this cheap felling. The story is taken from such great films as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills Have Eyes." I like this kind of movie, even if it's a good duplicate (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to watch: the actors are very bad, the dialogue is tacky and the music is stupid and totally out of place. You do not care what happens to the characters. The so-called thugs are also not interesting, but stereotyped. So what about blood and blood? Well, there are some, although it is quite cheap and the action runs very poorly. 2 Points, only for blood and blood, but I understand that this is hardly worth even for the injured dogs.
