This movie, for a special after class, is not so bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel like you're still in class. One guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paintball players. We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them. They suddenly become good players meditating. There are also many characters and no character development. A lot of time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids. That might have had a sense of 'Bad News Bears' (the original), since there was a girl on a team of all the boys, but there was no feeling in that movie. It has no feeling and leaves a dull ache in your bones after watching it, not fun to wrap, not fun to watch, and it's kind of ... there. Airplane. Boring. Something you watched after school before your nap before nightfall. As monotonous as the day is over and it has been a long and long day watching this movie.
