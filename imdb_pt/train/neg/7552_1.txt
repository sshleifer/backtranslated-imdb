The wicker man did the impossible! Replaced Cat Woman as the recent worst movie in my steel trap movie mind. Yeah, it's really that bad. So bad that when sitting to write this review I thought to myself "If I had the choice to see this movie again or have red hot needles pushed into my eyes" I could actually go for the red hot needles. Neil LaBute has created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit down and say with comfort and a guilt-free mind "Yes, that's a bad direction right there" <br /> <br /> I think the first clue to me should have been the slogan: "Some Sacrifices Must Be Done". Of course it may seem like a sinister line to intrigue you, but the sacrifice will all be on the side of the screen audience. Trust me on this, the people responsible for this movie should be accused of a hate crime ... or at least a scam for trying to pass it off as something like entertainment. Seriously! The movie is about an island where the men are there just for breeding and I still prefer to get stuck on Gilligans Island just with pictures of Condoleezza Rice and then see me stranded there. <br /> <br /> The most fun part about this movie was the guy who ripped off the highest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. This is neither a joke nor a fictitious one. I've never been to a thriller and heard lots of laughter throughout the movie. I can not tell you for sure if the laughter was intentional in some effort to ease the tension in the film or if they really thought this junk really would fly. Honestly, I've found myself heading for a power outage or maybe a fight to go out in the movies, anything to make it more interesting, which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I hit 2 beers each before the movie for a little mentality. anesthesia (soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films, write to your congressman today, do not delay). At one point I actually thought that maybe this movie was really a parody and Anna Ferris will show up as I wish. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage throws so much ham per frame that I'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today. Thinking I already thought Sean Penn was a d * ck for beating Nic's acting, oh, he's still a d * ck just smaller than a ?? Yes D * ck from Sean Penn was down because of this movie. Do us all a favor Nic play your strengths and get to be pathetic and drunk losers. You can not play superman you can not play strong roles hunky go straight to the jail do not pass go do not collect $ 200. His best moments in this movie are when he finally feels unbalanced and actually punches a stout woman to steal her bear suit (as the fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) and then begins to go crazy like Conan O'Brian Bear masturbating, but with half the joy of a bear knocking over his trash. Luckily, he finds his final shortly afterwards when it happens that he is a sacrifice to the crowd in the new hybrid show on the Burning Man and Lilith Fair tour. Yes!!!! I ended up spoiling the ending for you and if you knew better, you would build my statues in worship and sing songs from my legend. I sat in this fucking festival so you did not have to. <br /> <br /> About halfway through this little misadventure I kept thinking to myself Jack Bauer would have wrapped the case in 20 minutes in real time. .OK 35 minutes if Kim is attacked by a mountain lion first. Even Steve Martin, Inspector Clouseau, might have discovered this in less than an hour-and you, sir, are not Inspector Clouseau. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you are caught and have a chance to see this movie or get a bullet, take the bullet. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, Uwe Boll is laughing at us all.
