What is written on the poster is: "At birth, he received 6 years to live ... At 34, he takes the journey of his life." Ami is an Israeli born in the United States who was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy disease at 1 years of age. At age 34, after love for his 22-year-old caretakers did not go well, he decided to come to the US to face the doctor who said he would only be 6 years old. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and weighs 39 kilograms. Because? Your guess is as good as mine, even I've seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's brave to live when all he can move is his left index finger, but why is he so angry at the doctor? who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? Your doctor just told your mother that, based on your medical history, people with the disease will not live long. What is the point of him appearing at the old doctor's door? Why is tracking down this old doctor in America a journey of your life? There are so many things we might be interested in Ami's life: how can he make these animations with the movement of just one finger? How can he go through daily life while totally depending on others? How did he live the doctor's prediction? How does he deal emotionally when other people look at him as if he is looking at a strange creature? The movie did not tell us any of this. Instead, the filmmaker took a van and made a trip to let Ami appear at the door of his former doctor in order to show him that he is still alive. I thought it was a joke.
