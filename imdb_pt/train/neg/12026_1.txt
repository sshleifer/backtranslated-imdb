I really wish that when making a comedy, people would really try to make it funny. This is a movie that you can watch, but nothing is special about it. After watching, you will say that everything is fine. It was not boring to watch, but it did not make jokes to the public to laugh. The entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than a o.k. story. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie" but instead failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 in 10.
