This will be best known for the Ferrari that crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion. <br /> <br /> The racing and betting tale is poorly made by numbers that seem to have a director who could not see the car. numbers. Mostly a point and shoot case with a group of actors for a paycheck. This is not a good movie, but it's not bad enough to be watched and end up like a movie that is not worth bothering no matter how you look at it. Misogyny, despite the movie. In fact, one of the protagonists is a woman, this is a film that was clearly made just to leave the producer and director close to pretty girls. Do you want proof? There are lengthy long filming of women next to nothing that serves no other purpose, except perhaps arousing people's fear of renting a porn movie or the illustrated Sports Suit DVD. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs
