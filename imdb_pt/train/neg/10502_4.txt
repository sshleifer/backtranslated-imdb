The film has several story lines that follow several different characters. The different lines of the story do not seem like a complete play that makes this comedy very incoherent and even annoying to watch at times. <br /> <br /> It may seem weak and clich√©, but it's true; You're much better watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery Channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. I'm sure both the cast and crew had fun making this movie, but the film does not give our viewers much pleasure. For a comedy, it just is not funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin are simply not good actors, not even when they play themselves! His antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie and his scene seems long, disturbing, unnecessary and even annoying at times. <br /> <br /> The movie had a potential, I mean, Steve Irwin is a character. which in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch, so when I first heard they were doing a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was; bright! The film however heavily suffers from its weak history and incoherent story lines with uninteresting and bland characters. The movie has a certain entertaining value, at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once, but still, I certainly would not recommend that movie. Watching this movie seemed like a waste of time. Still, this movie can be watched only once, when it is shown on TV on a rainy afternoon. He has some good moments, but the stories really spoil the film and its potential completely. <br /> <br /> 4/10
