A good cast (with one big exception) makes its way through Epstein's clever light satire. Mansfield has never been better, or funnier, than she is here paired with Walston, who is a veteran who is determined to become a congressman to get out of the war. He and his friends - including co-artist Grant - go to San Francisco on leave and start the city party while conniving to escape service through touring industry lectures. The only thing about this movie that is not enjoyable is the presentation of a note from Suzy Parker as Grant's love interest, which takes up much of the film's time and slows down in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; the trick is that she strives to make love to all the soldiers (to fulfill her duty by the war effort, of course), but he is a married man who, however, loves his wife. They steal the film with little difficulty from Grant (which is fun here in the first part of the movie when it is not paired with its non-actor co-star.
