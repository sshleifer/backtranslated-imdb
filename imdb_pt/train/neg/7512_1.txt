After an hour, all I was seeing was that people were cheating on their wives, masturbating like dogs in a routine, and using the word f as a diabetic using Equal. <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot.

Any one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.
