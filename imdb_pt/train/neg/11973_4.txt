This is probably one of the worst French films I've seen so far, among over 100 French films I've seen. Terrible and very mediocre script / unprofessional acting makes the direction impotent. with all that, no matter how agreeable the western French scene and the chic music can contribute to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this film is that these two characters DO NOT attract people. audience I do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was amazed how this movie won the jury prize in Cannes, man, I love almost every award-winning movie in Cannes, but not the one here. A big disappointment to me.
