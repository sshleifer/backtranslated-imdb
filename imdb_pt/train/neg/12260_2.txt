Sometimes I rest my head and think of the reasons why movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still being made these days. They've been making these lame Jaws - copies since the '70s, it's not like they're getting more popular. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts killing people. First he takes out a few minor characters, so he starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of others, except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays an expert. One of the main characters usually dies before others kill the animal in some way, usually with a blast. So, we usually have a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or laid eggs, etc. etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a little variation. Unless you count the fact that the "expert" is a captain in this variation, in that case your standards are very low. It's funny that he's played by Duncan Regehr, he's totally used to being Zorro.Hell I'm going to give a bonus point to that.
