After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought it was time to go see it. Well, I do not know why I bothered. Basically, this family gets a clue leading to a large stock of ancient treasures, hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. Apparently, it had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs. In the first place, why did the knights transfer the treasure from Europe to America? How did the character Nic Cages discover that 'Charlotte' was actually a ship? How do they uncover all clues and puzzles in about a minute? And how would two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best-kept piece of paper in the world? These are just some of the holes in this Hollywood action plot that went awry. Cage was in great action movies - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why did he bow down to it? Is he getting too old? His character is really boring - Somehow, this "normal" guy steals the Declaration of Independence, defeats thieves with guns, runs away from the FBI, and often seems invincible. The whole movie does not make much sense and, after all, it was a big disappointment.
