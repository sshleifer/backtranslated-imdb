Professor Paul Steiner is researching on matter transfer. He has developed a machine that he can use to make an object such as a wristwatch or a rodent disappear, just so that this object materializes in a different location. But there are those at your research facility who dislike or approve of your experiments and will do whatever it takes to ensure that it does not succeed. After a failed demonstration that could have saved his funding, Professor Steiner decides to test his machine on himself. As expected, things go terribly wrong and he is turned into a heavily scared madman, whose simple touch will kill. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, it may not have been a good idea to review The Projected Man in the same week, I watched The Fly, Return of the Fly and Curse of the Fly. There seem to be only as many films about the transfer of matter and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that a person must endure within a period of three or four days. I'm not sure what the makers of the movie list are as a source of material for The Projected Man, but a lot of it is so much like Fly's movies that it can not be mere coincidence. However, The Projeted Man is not nearly as good as the worst of the Fly trilogy. <br /> <br /> In addition to being terribly unoriginal, The Projected Man has several other issues that actually detract from the movie's enjoyment. One big problem I have is with Bryant Haliday in the lead. He's such a dunce that not only do I care about his suffering, I really appreciate it. The supporting cast members Mary Peach and Ronald Allen are almost as bad as. They are so insipid and bland they hardly matter. In fact, there is very little to excite while watching The Projected Man. The soundtrack ?? it's not very memorable. The look "I would describe a lot of it as" muddy ". <br /> <br /> The predictable plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I watched The Projected Man through a copy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although it is not an absolute, often the poorer the film, the better the riffs of the MST3K.The faces have reached almost all their marks with The Projected Man. I'm going to give a very enthusiastic 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
