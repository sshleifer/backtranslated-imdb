I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn. <br /> <br /> So, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This film joins the club of sequences of films that should have been left alone. It holds absolutely none of the original super charm! It seems to me quite rough and almost brutal, from the (non) Sing-a-longs to the characterization. <br /> <br /> Although I remember that the character is telling a story through a song, The soundtrack of the movie was put on top and did not seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human is an excellent example: where he strolled eating an apple and adding a few jokes here and there, he should be dancing and singing about how good it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there is an old country dance type barn dance. It is as if writers have forgotten where and when this story was set. Optimistic violins certainly do not fit. <br /> <br /> Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 do not match the original. The work of art in this film seems rather crude and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderella's skirt, which does not seem right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could have been its own story, I think it should have been just that. I would not say I hate it, but I believe it has many shortcomings. It seems to demean significantly of Cinderella's original lover.
