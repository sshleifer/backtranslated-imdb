In recent times I have been subjected to both this film and "King Arthur" on DVDs chosen by others for the "entertainment" of one night and together they achieve nothing more than to sustain a growing notion that the modern audience of watching movies it lacks discrimination and is content as long as it has "action". Both films were total junk. <br /> <br /> What happened to character development? What happened to meaningful dialogue? What happened to ACTING? And by watching something that seems to be "historical," whatever has happened to try to capture some measure of precision, some realistic idea of ​​the "political map" of the time, even a slight taste of the time, especially in context Social. attitudes. Why do they all have to display the set of values ​​of 21st century America? I read in the notice boards that "little was known" of the dark ages. Not so. Considerable quantities are known, with a lot of erudition at the time, but these clowns simply could not be bothered to do any homework. <br /> <br /> I just wish I could vote 0/10
