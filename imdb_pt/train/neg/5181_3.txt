This is the first Horrorfest movie I watched and after almost thinking I do not need to see any of the others. I was told it's a "thinking man's horror film" and I have to say that if it made me think that it would make me wonder what the splatter / gore movies would look like. Do not get me wrong, not even the blood in this movie is worth passing. <br /> <br /> The plot is very faded with too much art for the good of the arts. The effects of camera and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least. Several characters and scenes seem useless at the end when they begin to reveal some of the hooks of "The Hamiltons." I discovered who Lenny was about half an hour when I discovered the movie. I was visually embarrassed and confused by Lenny's revealing that I felt completely cheated. I expected what I got, but they could have gone far beyond, in fact, all blood falls through. With movies out there like "Hostel" and "Saw" you need to come a little better for a movie that is "considered graphic or very disturbing to the general public."
