I watched this movie in my English class this afternoon and was amazed at how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was great as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails very badly. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at the stupid performance and repeated phrase: "Merry Christmas to all!" Other times I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a Charles Dickens tale about a rich guy who does not think Christmas is anything but farce. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who convince him to celebrate Christmas after all. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how this film, with such a bad script that must have been written in five minutes, can be so well judged. Instead of this piece of crap, I recommend Bill Murray's comedy Scrooged. At least that was funny ...
