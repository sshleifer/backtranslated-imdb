ALIEN LOVE (As this movie is known in Britain) is a very strange film. I do not mean it's an esoteric art film in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean it's a TVM with swearing, sex, some good T & A, a bad script and a very retro feel. You can imagine someone like John Hughes directing this ten years before, but of course he would have cut the T & A <br /> Returning to the bad script, one of the problems is that few of the characters have any kind of motivation , especially Amanda. Why does she pick up Connie at the bar? Just so she could meet an alien? Do you see what I mean about retro? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and a bunch of other mid-'80s movies had this kind of plot, most of them being more definite and compelling than the one we see here. The plot continues to follow an ill-defined, unconvincing and illogical path <br /> <br /> That said, I found the ALIEN LOVE watchable and not just the T & A on display. As a science fiction comedy, it is much better that FLESH GORDON and EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY
