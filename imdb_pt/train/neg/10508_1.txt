I thought the lowest point of the horror movie had been reached with "Book of Shadows", I was wrong. This movie makes it look like "The Magnanimous Ambersons" compared to this piece of shameless, unexposed stuff that has the audacity to call itself a movie. I wrote more, but I'm still angry at being dumb enough to spend Â£ 3 renting, reels. <br /> <br /> And these people were English? And where is the forest? I have lived in the UK two-thirds of my life, and as far as I know, there are no dark, poorly mapped forests in the central lands. The whole thing bally looked like a national conifer plantation. Those angels looked like anorexic pornstars (most of them were, did my research). However, I liked it when Judd was ripped to shreds. <br /> <br /> Q. I love and admire Tom Savini, but he CAN NOT ACT
