This was actually the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely horrible all through the movie, hair is so bad! They speak in monotonous voices and there is no chemistry. The DVD cover does not even remotely come close to what the movie really is. Really, very annoying. I had to move quickly through some of them because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know how on earth could anyone think this is good? hhaha they literally like to talk and say "yes" and there is no passion at all. I could not tell they were in love. I'm sorry, but this was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I've ever seen.
