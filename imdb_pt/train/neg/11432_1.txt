I watched this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkward script for five hours (or the time it really was). From the beginning, every element of this film is unbelievable. This movie made me laugh several times, but they were mostly out of shock that the director / writer really expected us to believe in the many scattered elements that tried to put the film together. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is Gray (Graham) and his problems with intimacy. Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother unexpectedly have a lot in common. <br /> <br /> Interesting, intriguing. However, instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable, the director continues to lead Gray to these ridiculous twists that never make any sense. Being an LGBT individual, this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the process of leaving. (I would be insulted if the writer was weird.) If it were not for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was understandably forced), I would give a 3-star negative.
