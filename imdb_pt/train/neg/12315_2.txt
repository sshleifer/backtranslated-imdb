OK, I'm not American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is not, has never been and will never be a funny man while our later ones point south. Phil Silvers, as Sergeant Bilko, was a funny man, no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented characters of the team who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and undated comedies that America has ever produced. How could anyone have the audacity to even try to replicate the character of Phil Silvers is beyond me. To complicate matters, the exercise was repeated in Martin's unfortunate attempt to be Inspector Clouseau of Peter Seller, another aborted attempt, in my view, to rekindle a provenly bland career. Some of its contributors say that 'Steve Martin puts his own brand on the character', to which I would say 'balderdash', his portraits will be long forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be treasured for generations to come
