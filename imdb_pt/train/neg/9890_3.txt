Another rape of history <br /> <br /> This movie is a catastrophe; he uses only a historical story and makes a sweet love story with poor acting and low budget production. <br /> <br /> The movie should be 1/3 time, they just dragged the time to make a mini-series. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical, the welds are stupid, the costumes are a catastrophe. The Romans were good at fighting in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest, in this movie the Romans chose to fight side in the city, I mean, stay real. <BR> And by the way, Cleopatra was of Macedonian origin, which means a light-skinned person.
