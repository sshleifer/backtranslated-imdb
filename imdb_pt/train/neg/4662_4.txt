The writers probably had no experience in the military, and probably never took a look at a history book, but I still give this war film a credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in World War II. The action is confusing and unbelievable - any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing Rosie Greer, from the New York Giant, it was worth it that I paid for it. The art direction is of the fifth category - the men wear uniforms from the Korean War, and the weather was very bad when the US Army arrived in Germany in 1944, not sunny like they show here, and I do not think the terrain resembled to northern California. . The script never makes it clear why black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1, which the second-line troops would probably have received. <br /> <br /> This basic idea of ​​history (Southern racist officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded to a large budget production at the time, and it is not too late to try now. You have to accept that for what it is, and I admire the creators of this movie for making the effort. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this some time ago and thinking I was in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
