Oh, dude, how the low-top hit fell to 1952! This boring thing is precisely the kind of series that angered Annie Wilkes (of Misery). Not only did heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that were not there in the previous chapter (and THAT COULD NOT be there - tell me that when the bad guys blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they would not see characters jumping), but I think this series has the world record of filming. I mean, for the most part it's a shoot! And not just from other series (apparently all flight sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the cool scenes from "melt rocks" from episode 2 to 3 are from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but from yourself! The entire "trip to the moon" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave Earth's atmosphere) of episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (Have you ever wondered why the MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9am so they did not have to do it all again!) <br /> <br /> Do not get me started in the science factor. Get ready to see the sunniest moon of all time! And the men of the moon who can not breathe in their own world? What were they smoking? <br /> <br /> And if that is not enough, it's very complicated and the stunts (usually the best thing on TV shows) are few and far between. Visually wise, am I the only one who thinks Commando Cody's bullet-shaped (or lime-shaped) helmet is totally ridiculous? The Rocketeer was much cooler, no matter how bad that movie was (and dude, it was awful). The tank-like vehicle is not much better, it seems like a lot of kids made it to Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of is that the actor who plays the hero is homemade, instead of the usual muscular piece (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then he's so unattractive ... <br /> <br /> Nor is it worth watching because of nostalgia. See Captain Marvel instead. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (BTW, check out the Memorable Quotes section for a true Pearl of the Women's Lib).
