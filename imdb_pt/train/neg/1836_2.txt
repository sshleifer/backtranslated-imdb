How is it possible that Barry Levinson rides the comedy talents White-hot Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the beautiful Rachel Weisz, the old professional Christopher Walken and still produce such a crap so humorless? <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are friends until the last one invents a spray to make the dog mess fade and become a multi-millionaire consumer conspicuous. <br /> <br /> The place is fine, but healthy enough in the right hands to have been a stepping stone to a big bitch between the two stars, but everyone involved outgrow every hand, every chance they can. Stiller and Black are not funny for long, Weisz looks sensational as always, but is criminally underutilized and, with the exception of Walken as a wacky barbarian who asks Stiller's character to take revenge, is a uncertain crossing to the end of this taut farce.
