I went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of New Age "spiritual" types, who, unlike me, liked this movie a lot - though according to those who also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more this absurd), the film is not so good. So if you think of yourself as "spiritual," you believe or at least you can tolerate such things as "aura" and "astral body," and you do not mind the frequent use of the term "energy" out of context. From physics or technology, you may really like the movie, and you'll probably like even more of any book on which it is apparently based. <br /> <br /> However, if you are largely in touch with the physical universe, if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily depleted by absurdities and inane New Age plots based on it, if in addition to that you have a low tolerance for lighting effects of cheese to denote the event of spirituality, and perhaps even expect non-timing reasonable dialogue a performance, then this is my recommendation to you in relation to this film: Stay. Far. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about it. Tonight, this movie replaced Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie theater. (I do not count movies that I watched with the expectation that they were bad, like Plan 9, etc.). At the same time, increased the total of films that I almost left for two (D & D being the other). I do not go out in movies, not even this one, but I should have first seen the visual representation of an aura because the New Age BS keeps getting thicker and thicker from that point on. <br /> The plot is about a group of people engaging in some ancient prophecies in search of spiritual enlightenment and with the goal of bringing humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something like this. They really talk about this spiritual material being the next step in human evolution, which should make anyone who has the slightest idea of ​​what human evolution is. The movie is full of surprises like that. Occasionally, people radiate what they would surely describe as "another dimension," or perhaps "another plan," only to become invisible to those around them who have not yet attained enlightenment. Goodness. <br /> <br /> In the end, the director sponsors the audience, rolling the painfully slow insights that make up the prophecy, presumably so we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better and more enlightened individuals. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie? Some very beautiful photos of nature and some decent supporting performances of Elizondo and Almeida. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can say that this seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if I consider this film interesting or acceptable. It is really a spiritism of the most naive type, and unless it is your thing, you better do something else with your time and money.
