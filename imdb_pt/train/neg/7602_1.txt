One of the other commentators mentioned that they almost quit. If I had not been with my wife, who wanted to stay, I would have gone. Too bad, because I think it could have been a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst adapted scripts I've ever seen. It starts nowhere and does not hit anything (I'd say it's not fast at all, but really it's not anything slow ... painfully slow). From time to time, there are signs that something interesting can happen, or that there is potentially some depth under one of the characters, but that's all we get - tips. There is not a single payment or revelation throughout the film. Not that I need a plan to be entertained ... I love a good character study as much as the next indie fan. But these characters add up to nothing. Throughout the duration of the movie, you do not care what happens to only one of them. In fact, you almost begin to expect them to die, because at least one death can be more interesting than watching your inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you think it would be interesting, but it is not. Rather than freaky characters, noir-esquire, acting in a hard-boiled way, you simply immediately recognize what it is: a lot of talented but miscast actors, meditating and raising eyebrows as you read the bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context. All this for two hours slow and painfully slow. Horrible.
