I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to accept a cut in wages, Warner Bros. retaliated by putting her on lower projects for the remainder of her contract. <br /> <br /> She decided to take the money. But his career suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> That may explain what she was doing on Comet Over Broadway. (Although that does not explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it too.) "Ludicrous" is the word that others have used for the plot of this movie, and that's right on target. The murder trial. His decaying vaudeville career. Your success in London. His last scene with his daughter. Neither part logically leads to the next part. <br /> <br /> In addition, the sets and costumes looked like things from the movie B. And her hair! Turner is showing off many of her films this month. Watch anyone else and you will be doing yourself a favor.
