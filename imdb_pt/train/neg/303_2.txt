It is impossible for me, objectively, to consider this film. Not that I have not tried, remember you - but I sit down and put on the old VHS, and I watch the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old again and I hold my own Assisted Watching and watching the movie of open eyes and an anxious heart. <br /> <br /> I can see objectively that this film is a BIZARRE combination of cuddly merchandising mascot puppies and chilling prepubescent children with evil powers that has a fine history and uninteresting animation. But my five-year-old son says, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So - I just (cautiously, reluctantly) recommended this movie to those who saw it during their youth and can invoke the incredible power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) OR those passionately cynical Gen-X / Y-ers who deliberately seeks the wonderfully bad / weird (a category in which this movie ... definitely belongs). For those who are really looking for an attractive movie or healthy family entertainment: you may want to keep looking.
