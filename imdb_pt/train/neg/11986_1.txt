What horrible writing and acting. No personality. Can not you make a good movie with a single character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with self-talk. <br /> <br /> So this kid goes on a trip to see his father. The boy, Jason, takes a plane and the pilot suffers a heart attack and dies in the middle of the flight. Then the boy falls into a lake and survives. Then he runs around, surviving in the desert until he is rescued. <br /> <br /> During this time he fights with a bear twice. The first time he fights on the lake. The second time he throws a spear from a branch and throws the bear. Two shots of fake blood gushing from the bear's chest reminded me of "The Holy Grail" by Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The kid also decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results. <br /> <br /> Gag.
