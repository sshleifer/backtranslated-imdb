Unfortunately it's true. "Legiunea sträinä" sets forth with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, the author has lost the ability to unite his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent way. Manically preoccupied with the mechanical trick of picking random news subjects and joining them without any legitimacy, he merely assembles an untidy pile of events, unable to follow the story line. The level of the script is similar to an amateur play "Romanian Cantoarea" on the glorious achievements of socialist realism - only upside down: while the communist line dictated a close concern only with positivism and sugary festivities, now Daneliuc is perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting eschatology. The content of the ideas is zero, and the "message", childlike and didactic, at the kindergarten level. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional principles. He can no longer organize a dramatic situation, order it in a correct cinematic scene, frame it correctly and edit it following the simpler rules of cinematic grammar. His level of storytelling in movie images is similar to saying something like: "Sacred sheet man is nothing right here, and all people are dumb!" What a huge distance from the impressive artist from 1976-1984, who had created unique works such as "Cursa", "Proba de microfon", "Vânätoarea de vulpi" - and even "Croaziera" and "Glissando" ... Sic gloria trânsito mundi ...
