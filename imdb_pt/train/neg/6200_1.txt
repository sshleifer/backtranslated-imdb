This is the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. That makes "Requiem for a Dream" look like a Disney movie. Although, technically, it is reasonably well done, acting, cinematography, music, direction, etc. are good. However, concluding the collective rape scene is the most terrible and violent thing I have ever seen and I really wish I had not seen it. I'm afraid this will haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think someone would find the film extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were victims in a very similar way and I did not really need an explicit reminder of the horror they experienced. I saw the movie at the SXSW film festival in Austin, TX and none of the cast or crew was present. I wish they had the opportunity to defend the violence in your film, which I felt excessive, gratuitous and unnecessary. A previous scene successfully transmitted the mood they apparently sought, but without rubbing their faces in extreme and explicit sexual violence. This movie should have a big warning label. For these reasons, I would not recommend anyone to see it. You have been warned.
