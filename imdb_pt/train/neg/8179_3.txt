Sea bottom divers hope to find gold, but find greed and hatred lead to murder, "according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. "Manfish" is their boat name, not a monster. The skeleton that gives Captain John Bromfield (as Brannigan) his half of the treasure map is very good. Old Salt Victor Jory (as Professor) supplies the other half of the map.

Serious editing problems and continuity damage the image, which otherwise might have been something. <br /> <br /> Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
