I bought this film for 1 euro, without knowing what it was. I thought "hmmm, a movie called mutilation man should be, if not very funny, at least filled with blood." It was not funny, right. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I do not mind disturbing movies, but this does not mean anything except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... The quality of the pictures was terrible. The acting ... there was no performance. Just a few muffling fcker for over 90 minutes. This is probably material for the patient to struggle with extreme violence. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it. Not worth your time. It's just awful. I wish I had never bought it. <br /> <br /> They should mutilate the guy who did this
