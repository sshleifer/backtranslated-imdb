the only word I can think of to describe this movie is: Ordinary. The plot about Gary Sinise's character who attempts suicide is a ridiculous premise and comes ... Living as a kind of hermitage or recluse in a cabin that drives golf balls in the ocean because he could not handle life in the lucrative pro / am golf community? Cry me a river. I wish these were my problems. I like Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a paycheck for Sinise. The scene in which little Timmy Price is verbally assaulted by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so exaggerated that I'm ashamed to watch it.
