I've seen most, if not all of Laurel & Hardy's classic films. I always liked stupidly comic, even after watching it over and over again. This new movie tries to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble Laurel & Hardy, but fails miserably for several reasons. One of which is how out of place their cloths are (still in the early 20th century) however they are both portrayed in the 90's. Some of the old dialogues were brought back but also fail miserably to get close to the classic series. This movie may well be the worst movie I have ever seen and it should be taken off the shelf and locked up forever. The real Laurel and Hardy are rudely spinning in their graves in such a bad imitation.
