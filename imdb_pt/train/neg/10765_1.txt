A splendid example of how Hollywood could (and still can) have a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly ruin everything. In the case of "Big Sky," writer Dudley Nichols and the company arrogantly assumed they could enhance a classic pioneering novel by award-winning Pulitzer Prize-winning author AB Guthrie. In doing so, they removed the soul from history and any advantage and impact she may have had as a film adaptation. The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of his main character, Boone Caudill, from a naive Kentucky boy to a survivor and competent mountain man, was replaced by a boat hoax that did not. has much similarity with the intention of the author. In the film version, Boone's presence is nothing short of expected. <br /> <br /> Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie's novel impact and excitement were removed for no apparent reason. Most intriguing of all is the emphasis on the character of Zeb Calloway, who was a minor, incidental character in the book, occupying only a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the veteran pioneer, is completely absent !!! It is also evident that the director Hawks decided that the character Zeb in the film, interpreted by the actor Hunnicutt, was not irritating enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt received a significant amount of time making that hateful narration that is the Hollywood shortcut for writing, editing and directing incompetently. <br /> <br /> Some movies really did improve books they were based on (William-Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is a prime example). But this is horrible and depressing not just as an adaptation of a novel, but as a movie in itself. <br /> <br /> History is monotonous and clich√©d, and the characters - at least those who have not been edited in the script - are only superficial and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately, the appeal of Kirk Douglas, who could have helped raise this film, was sunk by the role of milk he received. <br /> <br /> If you can believe, the film version of Guthrie's Pulitzer award-winning sequel The Way West, also starring Kirk, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" further solidifies Howard Hawks' place as one of the world's most overrated and overweight directors. Cinema's history.
