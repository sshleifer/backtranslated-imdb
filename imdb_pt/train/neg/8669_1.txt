First of all, I loved Ray Bradbury's novel. It's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and stays with you later. It was one of his best books, with Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hope this movie is okay. He had many chances, with a great cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the screenplay alone. And, above all this, there is PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How can this fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers inside it. <br /> <br /> First of all it was dumbfounded. Much of the horror of the book was lost, as Bradbury must have been forced to keep violence to a minimum. All the visuals in the book ... are gone. Everything that made you squirm ... is gone. <br /> <br /> And then there's the acting. Like many movies that Disney released in the 1980s, the children in this movie can not act. And that bothered me a lot, none of them looked 13, but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were known. <br /> <br /> You would think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could do this in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here is how they just do not care. All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. This is far from one of his best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was fine as the witch, but the character of the witch of the dust was not well ripped. She is much less evil and does not have the presence as she did in the book. <br /> <br /> And everything that was left out of the book. The nightly pursuit of the balloon, the marking of Jim's house, the actual death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the merry-go-round, the fate of the rod seller, the true death of the witch, and oh, much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad even for the 80s. <br /> <br /> The carousel of doom for a thing with the superimposed horses out there was not really scary, and that strange green haze that really had nothing to do with it. see with nothing. <br /> <br /> I could keep talking about how this movie destroyed the original novel, but it makes the blood boil. Do not watch this movie, but read the book. It's a Bradbury classic.
