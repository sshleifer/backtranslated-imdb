I hate this movie! It was NOTHING like the book, and just thinking about it drives me crazy. If you watch the movie before you read the book, then it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning may be similar, but most aspects of the film are completely different. The end for example! So in the book, it's extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible version of the movie, as they lead them through a stupid labyrinth ... yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that irritated me was that Jack just killed Mr. Halloran! Hell, he's basically the hero of the book and they just kill him like he's not important. Overall, it was bad that the movie was so out of thin air.
