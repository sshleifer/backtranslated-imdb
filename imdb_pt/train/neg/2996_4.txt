Born Again is a non-standard episode since season one. He deals with the subject of reincarnation and simply does not fly. I've never been big on reincarnation and this could be part of my apathy for this episode. He refers to the Tooms case, which is a good continuation of the previous episode. But the good points end there. Which is unfortunate because this happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous that a dead guy has chosen to reincarnate in the body of a completely different girl. And he waits until the girl turns eight to begin revenge. There is even a serious lack of dialogue with Mulder and Scully to keep the episode afloat. If you are in reincarnation, maybe this episode is in your alley. If you are not, then at least you can learn what bradycardia is.
