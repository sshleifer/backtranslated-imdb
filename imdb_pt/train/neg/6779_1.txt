There is a high expectation level when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast led by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations are further boosted when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comedic touch was so evident, among others, DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. In the first five minutes, it seems that these expectations can be met and then? Anything. What is supposed to be a light comedy, plunges into a coarse and heavy melodrama with only a laugh to be made. Newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance, or the lack of one, in this film, but in a movie in which even the great Cary Grant often appears flat and wood, attacking Parker seems unfair. Not even a light as bright as Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fate of this sinuous, somber, and utterly senseless script that creeps and drags the spectator's interest and patience down. The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, is still trying to breathe something into the proceedings, but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation. The desperate and insane effort to drag a half-bored laugh out of the numbed audience in the last moments of the movie serves only to add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a big disappointment on all levels.
