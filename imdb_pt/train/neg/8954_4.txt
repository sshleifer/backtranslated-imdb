I had high hopes for this movie because I really enjoyed the book. However, I do not think I would have understood the premise of the film if I had not read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of people trying to break the bonds of the ruling government, but the book portrays suffering in much more depth. Corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while ordinary people struggle to get basic survival needs. Perhaps most people feel that way about their leaders and rulers, whether or not they are oppressed or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems to exist in many places in our modern world. It's been several years since I read the book, but references to Big Brother, Thought Police, and Newspeak are often heard in the media and in casual conversations. Most people who use these terms probably do not realize where the terms came from. I strongly recommend that you read the book.
