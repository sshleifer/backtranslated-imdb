This movie is about a group of gay extraterrestrial black men who wipe out women on Earth in order to create a gay universe. <br /> <br /> I watched with intent to see how bad it was. Still, I was shocked at how bad it was. It looked more like a movie 50 years ago. The acting, if any, is very bad. The sets and props are so ridiculously fake, making any college movie look like a mega budget. And the special effects are ridiculously simple, in fact, jaw-dropping, as others have commented, but the chin is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> You need to be seriously intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness to enjoy this movie. If I were from Denmark, I would be very ashamed and humiliated that my compatriots produced such a horribly bad film.
