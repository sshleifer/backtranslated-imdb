"Problem Child" is one of the most idiotic films of all time. Not the worst (although some people disagree with me about it), but it's not the best either. It's about a diabolic 7-year-old boy who destroys comic destruction in a childless couple (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who foolishly adopts it. This movie is very silly and unbelievable because I do not believe even for a second that a child can act as little as the boy does in that movie. It's stupid and absurd even though I've laughed several times (I really do not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know I'm being kind to you. If there is one positive thing about "Problem Child" it is that it is better than the sequence that was simply awful. <br /> <br /> (of four)
