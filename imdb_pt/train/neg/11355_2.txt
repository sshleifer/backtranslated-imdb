"Nat" (voice of Trevor Gagnon), along with his friend "IQ" (voice of Philip Bolden) and always "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what encourages their dreams is that the first spacecraft to land on the moon, Apollo 11, is waiting for its historic voyage on the launch pad, near where the three pass. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the animation of the movie. I found it very well done. The scenery had depth, since things at a distance seemed to be behind the focus of the scenes. I did not see the 3-D movie as it was aired on HBO. However, I could see that there really were no scenes that took advantage of the 3D effects, except a fight between the characters near the end. I was not too impressed with the character design either. To me, they did not look like anything like a fly, especially in color. The flies were an unusual blue gray that kind of distracted me. <br /> <br /> The performances of the cast were not bad, but it was not good either. I have often focused more on my computer than on the story. The writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comedic moments that will make the younger children laugh. I have not seen anything for adults, as jokes that they will achieve the result for adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> The story was not followed in this movie. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, since the main focus was the flies. I also hated when a well-known astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the movie were a work of fiction, and no fly was on Apollo 11. I liked how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed themselves. their lives for space exploration though. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not made for the whole family. This is certainly only for children. But, save this for a rainy day.
