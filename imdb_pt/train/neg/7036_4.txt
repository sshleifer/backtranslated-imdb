I'm not ruining anything when I tell you that you can see a woman fucking a goat in that movie. If that's your thing then your movie has come. <br /> <br /> A woman and her husband will see their estranged sister in the family mansion in the forest. Your sister is a scary lady to say the least, and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love. Beside, a group of disgusting characters appears and begins to stage all sorts of pagan rituals. <br /> <br /> The plot is very weak and the characters are pretty dumb. The woman stays around, even after her husband starts to turn into an idiot and go out with the pagans, still continues to have sex with him. On the exploring side of things, there is a lot of naked flesh and a couple of eccentric couplings, but nothing that has not been better elsewhere. Oh, and the above mentioned goat sex scene. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will not come to an end. Exploration fans will struggle, but they will want more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
