I will admit that Alice's plot, having survived the previous episode of the Nightmare series, meets Freddy Krueger's deadly dreams starting again. This time the insulting killer is attacking the sleeping mind of Alice's fetus. Its intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only person who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own child? This movie started off really well, as we see Alice dreaming about being Amanda Kruger, who gets stuck in the bedroom and raped by 100 Manics, so she's being taken to the hospital, but she's not the pregnant woman anymore, but she's giving Amanda light Freddy again Alice and Dan are the only two people coming back from the 4th movie and then having some new friends, not long before Freddy starts killing again, I did as the first dead, okay, not as good as the other deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself did not seem to be Spooky in this movie at all, the nightmare was just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all. Acting in movies was good for a fifth film in the series, but overall I think this movie was really boring. (Not yet the worst movie in the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
