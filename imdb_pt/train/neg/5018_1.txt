I rented this movie just to see Amber Benson, although after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good story ... however, the first problem was that there really was not a story ... or there was actually a story but no It made absolutely no sense. The second problem was that there was no scenario for these characters ... yes, I understood that everyone went to school together, but in the first 3 minutes of the movie you noticed that they had nothing in common and did not like each other . ... so why do they continued together? Flaw number three ... the director, despite making long pauses and sharp photos, equaled the suspense (especially with the typical dubbed ominous music) ... he was sadly mistaken. It was painful to watch a fantastic actress Amber Benson as wasting time trying to bring it back to life ... My only hope is that the money she made was placed here to produce your own movie.
