What a powerful beginning for a movie when the character of Julia Roberts is punched in the face by the abusive and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to experience a powerful film on the same level as Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was misguided. This movie was nothing like The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the role of a woman you really felt, and felt your pain and your need to survive. Sleeping with the Enemy fell after the first act in cheap emotions with Roberts feigning his death to escape her husband and goes to live in Iowa. The husband believes she is dead, but begins to suspect that she may still be alive and goes after her. The rest of the film is basically a cat-and-mouse game with Julia getting a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity .... there's no mention, of course, how she got the money for it, but this time in the movie I did not care that much. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls in love with him and her husband finally catch up with her, but not before rearranging his soup cans and straightening up the kitchen. This was assumed to provide an inexpensive emotion for the public. But I do not care much if she was a woman abused because the movie as I said deceived the public. If I had stayed the course, I could have felt it for her and her situation. Of course her husband is dead and all is well for little Roberts. If only the real world were something close to that ... See the Burning Bed and you understand what a movie should be about the subject of domestic abuse.
