Wow ... <br /> <br /> I caught it at the local Wal-Mart after reading online it had been released early. I've been following this online for some time, and I just had to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think the thing that really impressed me was editing. , or lack thereof. More and more often, the characters (usually The narrator and whoever it is) are shown walking ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not an editor but I know you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them that they reach point B. No need to show almost the whole journey! Wow ... <br /> <br /> Actually, I ended up feeling a little sad for the actors involved in this. They seem to have given no guidance on what to do during the scenes, as well as looking scared or looking happy, depending on the action to be added at a later date. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still employs thumbnails at times. One of the most distracted uses of the green screen in this film is the constant agitation of (according to the final credits) the same group of people representing the citizens of different towns and villages, including London. Sometimes these people are coming and going without regard to the angle of the shot or the distance from the camera. In a shot in London, there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracted mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why Timothy Hines talked about this movie the way it did is beyond me. It is a simple and simple turkey. On the plus side (at least for me) provided some of the most genuine laughs of hilarity I have seen in a long time.
