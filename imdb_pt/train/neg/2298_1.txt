Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons dubiously claiming "relatively good history" in predictions. <br /> <br /> In his widely publicized comments from the Jan. 2 issue of The 700 Club of the Christian Broadcasting Network, during which he predicted that were "very serious terrorist attacks" and "mass murders" in the United States in the "second half" of 2007, host Pat Robertson boasted of having "a relatively good track record" in previous predictions. But a review of Robertson's 2006 New Year predictions undermines this claim. He predicted, for example, that: "President Bush will be strengthened." WRONG <br /> <br /> * "Fall elections will be inconclusive, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in charge." WRONG <br /> <br /> "The war in Iraq will come to a successful conclusion. Let's start withdrawing troops before the end of this year." In addition, as reported in an Associated Press article January 3, Robertson has a history of making dubious predictions: <br /> <br /> The broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win reelection. Bush won 51 percent of the vote at the end of the year, defeating Democrat Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. WRONG <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would win after victory in his second term. He said that Social Security reform proposals would be WRONGLY APPROVED! <br /> <br /> He says to speak directly to God ... If so, God has a lot of sense of humor watching Pat play silly again and again ..
