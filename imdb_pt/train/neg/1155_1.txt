never before did a movie lead me to write a review, but that was just terrible. I stayed with him trying to figure out what it was that made the bishop choose as his first serious role, but frankly, it was a bad choice. made a good book, but it certainly did not work for me as a movie. I found it unbelievable, lacking atmosphere and I found many of the scenes horribly blistered. A musical conductor he may be, but a serious snooty actor is not. by Dylan Mcdermott and Rose Byrne was passable, but not enough to lead a weak plot with a weak dialogue. maybe I just lost the point completely, but for me it did not fit into any genre, did not provoke any empathy with the characters or create any suspense, in fact I found myself praying at the end and repressing a deep desire to beat all three main characters!
