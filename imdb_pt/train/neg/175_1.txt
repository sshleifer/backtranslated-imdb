I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon in the USA. Considering that this movie was made for TV, it was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So I tuned in to the exhibit that night and was extremely disappointed. I knew I would not like the movie, but I did not expect to be stumped by using DV (digital video). The film would have been tolerable were it not for these juxtaposed digital photos that seemed to come out of nowhere. I hoped the plot line was tied to these scenes, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (ATTENTION: THE FOLLOWING MAY BE A SPOILER !!!!) The open end at Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the ending opened up following is ridiculous. I can only predict Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch is if the movie was shown against anything but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
