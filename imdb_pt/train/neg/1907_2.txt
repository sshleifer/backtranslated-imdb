This horribly bad trash can be racist, sexist, and homophobic all at once, pretending to be very chic and sophisticated. Atrocious performances, a clich√© script and a tedious direction make this movie avoided. Two scenes were especially offensive - the one in which Schaech rubs his tongue after being kissed by another man (could have really been so disgusting), and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend who pretends to be Russian. After he leaves the room, she exclaims "f ** king foreigners"! So much for her to be a cultured artist who dreams of living in Paris! Jonathon Schaech may be a nice on-screen actor, and he is surprisingly handsome. It's a pity he has not learned more from the work of avant-garde gay director Gregg Araki in a previous film, and try to save this movie from falling into a series of gay stereotypes and a mud of homophobia.
