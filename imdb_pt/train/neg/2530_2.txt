This movie was abysmal. and not on the right path as some have claimed. Firstly the main character is a very unattractive ginger man. Second - WTF is happening with this love van. The plot basically is: boy wants sex, so buy a van (which, in fact, is pretty cool). Unbelievably, since he looks like a newt, he punctuated with many girls! And he fails with some. Then he scores with a very hot girl and realizes that he loves that sloppy bird that played hard to get. So he drags the races with the hottie's boyfriend. And he drops his van. At what point danny devito saves the day. Although he did not need to, because when he pulled the van down, the ginger boy crossed the line first. I gave this 2's as I'm willing to assume there's some kind of Vanning subculture of the 70's that I'm not getting and also because there's some boobage from the 70's as well.
