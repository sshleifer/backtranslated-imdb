I own almost every Seagal movie (yes, even those who have low budget), and I must say that this may be the worst, not only of your movies, but of all the movies already made. The only highlight of this film, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. is Seagal, and B. Seagal has some sweet action sequences, specifically in the store, and also whenever he takes a whole army with a knife. Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people, and do not even bother with a plot, because the plot not only stank, but also the acting, the fact that the F-18 and the F-14 somehow become turned into F-16s, and also the fact that Stealth was as fast as an F-16. Also Stealth never had to refuel ??? And since when Afghanistan is considered hostile territory from an Air Force point of view. The last time I checked, Afghanistan has no Air Force, we control the skies. In addition, this secret mission was played through loudspeakers for all staff in the room, but the admiral still whispers to the other guy who is secret. Also, how did Seagal get from the bottom of the truck to the top? Please tell us why you were imprisoned. Since when does the Air Force pilot large commands (unless they're Owen Wilson?). And since when are drunks in the Arab countries, considering that Muslims do not drink alcohol? Also, since when did the Arabs listen to women's orders as the number 2 in command? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
