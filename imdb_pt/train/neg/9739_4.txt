It is not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION has little potential. In fact, the underexploited title phenomenon is quite intriguing and, at least in the initial half, this effort by Tobe Hooper promises to amuse in a way that only the tacky horror of the 90s can. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's performance and the overly complex plot, this aspiring thriller loses its course. <br /> <br /> Dourif, featured here before his internal horror fan base has piled up. , is the average guy Sam. Of course the average guys do not average for a long time in horror movies, so, after a well done sketch, we see several parts of Sam's body beginning to ignite. Soon he is lighting other people too, much to the dismay of his friend Lisa, played by Cynthia Bain. Although the title of the film implies that a fiery monster on the loose, director Hooper chose to do so. to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an additional human depth that it otherwise would not have, but it also prevents us from really dreading the human flamethrower. We wondered if this would have worked better as a direct effort of villain versus everyone, which is a fairly nominal effort when all is said and done. It will have more appeal to Dourif fans and to those who can not get enough in the 90's, whether good, bad or in the middle, but only on a slow night.
