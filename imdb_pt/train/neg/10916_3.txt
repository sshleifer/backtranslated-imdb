To the home audience, I can see how they applaud this movie. For outsiders, without interests, that did not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and the Russians as heroes. The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction. As a young woman could "love" the lieutenant just to catch a glimpse of him was nonsense. How could she, as mentioned at the end of the movie, never marry just because of that passion was beyond me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots and this was exemplified in the pursuit of the swamp. Several hundred German soldiers advanced, pushing the Russians into the swamp. Then the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and stood there listening. I suppose they did not want to wet their boots, but I'm sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the swamp. But that would have ended the story. In addition, the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the attic and did not bother to shoot the roof. In the worst case, a soldier would have thrown a grenade in the attic and would not have climbed a ladder to enter. <br /> <br /> I saw some critics who said they cried in the end. I want to know why? You knew that this little band would perish and they were not at all dare.
