I must be that guy in America who did not like this movie. I guess this was not my style or something, I just do not see what's so fascinating about it, it was * barely fun, let alone one of the greatest achievements in movie history. <br /> <br /> It's about a guy who came from nowhere and becomes a drug dealer. A very simple way to describe an entire movie, and that's just my feeling about the whole movie. Contrary to what many people think, just because a movie is about mafias / drug trafficking / criminal groups, it's not automatically a great movie, do not forget to tell stories.
