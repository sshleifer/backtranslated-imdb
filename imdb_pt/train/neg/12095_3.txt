Elfriede Jelinek, still not a household name, is a Nobel literature laureate. His novel generated a movie that won the second prize at Cannes and the top awards for both male and female leads. Am I a dinosaur in terms of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so degraded that it's worth everything? 'Devour, devour' is the preferred orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the world of cinema, a turkey is a monumental failure measured by receipts from the box office or critical reception. 'Devour, devour' and the piano teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing horror of this widely praised film can not be overstated. It starts very badly, as if it were done to annoy the viewer. Credits interrupt scenes without consequences for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of acclaimed authorship, a stone piano teacher. She lives with her hoarse, domineering mother. Dad is an institutionalized madman who dies invisible during what passes for action. <br /> <br /> Reviewing the piano teacher is difficult as well as recording your dislike. What we see in the film (and you can read in the book, as far as I know) is a tasteless, exploitative and absurd tale of an emotional pendulum swinging from side to side without moving on. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity, but totally repressed. Not really, because there is a bag two steps away from the scene with his voice hoarse voice at the beginning that ends with profuse apologies. If a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would), Elrika's mood would be alternately alternated. <br /> <br /> A young boy, Walter, studying to become a "low-voltage" engineer, whatever it is, and playing ice hockey in his few leisurely moments, is also a talented pianist . He meets Elrika in an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and begins to 'cherchez la femme'. <br /> <br /> Suppressed Erika has a taste for heavy pornography, shown briefly, but graphically for a few seconds, as she sniffs a handkerchief from the wastebasket on the private booth where she watches. Walter makes a brilliant audition and is reluctantly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose style of teaching is characterized by estrangement, hostility, discouragement, and humiliation. <br /> <br /> He soon declares his love and soon pursues Erika in the ladies, where they practice light and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over her passionate love. She promises to send you a letter of instructions for more enjoyable exchanges. Meanwhile, with jealous envy because of Walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally taking the shit out before a rehearsal for some future concert, Erika fills the student's coat pocket with glass broken, causing severe lacerations in delicate piano hands. <br /> <br /> The next big scene (bypassing genital self-mutilation, etc.) has Walter appearing in the apartment Erika shares with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, tied, slapped, etc. The sensible Walter is, for the time being, repulsed and marches into the night. <br /> <br /> At this point there is still almost an hour ahead. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika traces Walter to the ice rink, where he practices ice hockey. They retreat to a back room. Wust Lusty is unable to resist his hands pulling on his pants. Your "baby sauce" is soon expelled with other stomach contents. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Repelled but addicted, perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently vomited on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what happens now? It is not too deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. One moment he is locking Mom in her room and beating Erika, the other he kicks her in the face, having sex with her and renewing her declarations of love. <br /> <br /> Am I being unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you want, but I advise you not to. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they are in the right mood. I could talk about the challenging depiction of the human relationships conveyed by this movie, if I wanted to. But I 'prefer not to,' because this is a cheap and nasty movie that appeals to the basic instincts and says nothing. <br /> <br /> I must say that the repressed by the parents, Erika, yearns for love, ineffectively demand. in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it appears literally pink and throbbing under the nose, belatedly realizes that it does not like to be hurt, blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> The world, for reasons unexplained, atrophied it. She apparently makes a monster of somebody who looks superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist because that is his essential nature no matter how much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you have the patience to be there, there is a little twist. Before going to the final scene, where she should perform as a substitute for the underwear student with lacerated hands, Erika puts a knife in her purse. To Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you're ahead of me. She stabs herself in a non-life-threatening area and walks away. Roll credits. <br /> <br /> If it won the second prize at Cannes, how bad was the rest of the entries?
