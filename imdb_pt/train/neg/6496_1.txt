This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I'm the kind of person who starts a movie and does not hang up until the end, but I was forcing myself not to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not hang up was because I'm a big fan of Christian Slater and I wanted to see him working on it. I was really speechless after I finished watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for putting a little humor in it. If you had not been in this movie, I'd have been bored. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins needs to keep acting. By the time the movie ended I did not even get the plot. I was confused and irritated.
