SCHIZOPHRENIAC: WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you bring together a group of untalented people to make an "extreme" horror movie. Any kind of acting, production, plot, FX, etc ... goes out the window in an effort to create "shock value". Now do not misunderstand me - I consider myself a connoisseur of "shock" movies, and the skinny / gorier / nastier, but it's good to see some kind of SOMEBODY talent involved in the film. SCHIZOPHRENIAC tells the story of Harry Russo - a drug addict who is ordered to kill the mannequin of his ventriloquist, Rubberneck. He goes in a few weeks killing prostitutes and other random people, and screaming about how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (which is "whores" to those of you who do not speak New York-ese ...) and how he wants to rape them on the butt. There are some weak scenes of necrophilia, very little blood and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing you have not seen in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> The only thing left I can find in this retarded movie the frequent (involuntarily?) screams of our main man, Harry. He goes ahead and about wanting to kill everyone and get them on the butt, and this really becomes quite comical after a while. In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there must be some kind of homo-erotic tone for this movie, with all the talk of ass and constant shots of Harry running with his dong coming out. In all honesty, this joker is nekkid more in this movie, so the few puppies that show some T-e-A (and some full-frontal, for good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is a bit of fun to watch once, but I really can only recommend this to those who want to be able to say that they watched a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title by far - is the best thing about this crap ... A generous 3.5 / 10
