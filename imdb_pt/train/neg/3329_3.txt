Take your basic Frankenstein movie, inject some Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you'll have Doctor Hackenstein. Of course, this was obviously inspired by the above-mentioned movies, but it never materializes as something special on its own. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie happens overnight as he tries to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut some women's body parts that have been stranded and, coincidentally, decide to stay the night instead. <br /> <br /> I can not really say that acting is bad. , nor is it the direction. Everything here is simply normal. The little attempts that exist in humor really work (check the scene where Hackenstein hides behind his deaf assistant because she would be very upset if she saw him holding a woman and a needle), but that is not enough to recommend this movie. The music is decent, the blood is decent and the cast looks pretty good. And in half the time, I had fun with this movie. But I never felt like it was anything more than a waste of time. Preventable. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker.
