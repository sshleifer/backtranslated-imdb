By all accounts, this could have been an interesting movie. With a score of the powerful Cradle Of Filth, starring her vocalist Dani and being hailed as "the future of British horror," I expected the Alex Chandon festival to live up to the hype. wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is cliché or inept. The short story anthology tale was made to death (and much better) in the seventies and eighties. It is true that the idea of ​​"the patient's room" sent a chill down the spine, but like most of the film, the script was poorly written and acted. <br /> <br /> Chandon can not write dialogues. Every sentence with the chief investigator of the police is full of swearing and insolence (the typical 'cop on the edge' formula. Funny, I'm sure I've seen this somewhere before ...) No, Chandon, you're not Tarantino . Or Scorsese. It looks bad. Add ridiculously OTT acting with a very dishonest cast (do not get me wrong, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but actor he is not) and the performances are beyond laughable to the creepy vein. Give me Bruce Campbell any day. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are generally poor, with some atrocious CGI, horrible bloody effects (for goodness sake, Peter Jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget) and editing filters who scream OVER-USE! As for the often confused use of the Cradle Of Filth score ... dude, they should sue. <br /> <br /> The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously, trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience. many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do so much better with far superior blood effects (for example: maniac, zombie meat eaters, the beyond, suspiria etc), making Cradle of Fear in my mind, second and obsolete. I hope Chandon can learn from this horrible ghoul in a movie and do some quality horror that really scares him. Better luck next time.
