There is a really good film tucked just below the surface of the layers on layers of cheese that is "the Pagemaster". <br /> <br /> I discovered this when I saw it again this morning after neglecting it for years and years. I remember hating it with passion when it first came out, but this time I discovered that the special effects are very good. The plot is just "the endless story" with an endectomy of creativity, but it's a small movement well for anyone who just wants a really incredible eye candy. The animation is incredible, and I especially enjoyed how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surreal than the norm. I'm giving a note of three, since I * would * have given a two (just for parody value) if I had decided to watch this movie expecting it to blow my mind.
