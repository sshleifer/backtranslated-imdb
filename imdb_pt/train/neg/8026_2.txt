It makes us wonder how this show is still on the air. There were one couple who were married, married, and have children, but all the others separated. What's the point of continuing this? The show can be fun at first. You see all the girls fainting over a man, almost all of them instantly. It's like in real life! The girls start to take sides, to complain and show their true self (or so we think). But that man is left to decide who to choose that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What is true love exactly? How can you fall in love with someone when you are forced to choose them? This show is unbelievable. Did you think dating online was bad, but do people need to go to the TV to find love? It is not realistic. How could a girl be with a man when he's dating several others, fucking them? None of these questions are answered, and finally, when the show ends, you know there will be no happy ending in the future. For all we know, everything is scripted.
