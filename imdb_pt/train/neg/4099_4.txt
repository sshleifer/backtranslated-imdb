Mulva is put on a sugercoma by Teen Ape. When she wakes up, she is considerably warmer (the parts played by Debbie Rochon in this sequence), and out of revenge on those who have done her harm. As the sub-title and box art implies that this is really a takeoff of the films of "Kill Bill", but being this a film by Chris Seaver, it is an extremely incompetent satire (and I use that last term extremely loosely) this is better than the first movie but truth be told that I was so incredibly drunk when I saw the previous movie that I can not wait to compare the two at this point. But I must have liked it since I bought the sequel (see when I'm drunk I like, for lack of a better word, complete and total shit movies) There are a few moments laughing (very few) but I remember Bonejack being funnier though. Well at least in little more than an hour, it's faster than necessary. <br /> <br /> My Notes: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Audio commentary by director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon and the LBP gang; According to Seaver's comment; 31 minutes Making featurette; Lloyd Kaufman's 6-minute tribute to low-budget imagery; Commercial counterfeit syrup of 2 minutes; gallery of stills; Promotional Trailer; "" The Feral Man, "" The Bonesetter, "" Midnight Skater, "" Demon Summer, "and" Splatter Rampage Wrestling " "
