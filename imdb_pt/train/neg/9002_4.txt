OK .... I only have 3 words - cheese, cheese and CHEESE! The only redeeming feature of this film is Dean Cain. Also - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The film has some promise in the concept - an underground laboratory creates a real living dragon that breathes fire - basically giving us more of "Jurassic Park" "Reign of Fire" ..... There are some great possibilities, but they just do not follow through completely ... The special effects are decent - even knowing that the dragon is CGI, it does not look horribly CGI .... <br /> <br /> I would not put the blame on Dean Cain (although he is one of the producers), I would put more blame on Phillip Roth - the director and writer. It's your job to make this movie ... and, unfortunately, it failed.
