Incredibly horrible movie. I watched part of this on TV recently. My jaw dropped as I watched a terribly conceived conspiracy and listened to nonsense that numbed the mind. Not a single line of the master of one liners could come close to producing anything like a laugh. It was so bad it made me want to exhume Rodney Dangerfield's body, smack him and shout, "How could you?" I know that many movies are rushed, hoping to profit from the popularity of a particular actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. It is sad and scary that people are expected to pay to see this foolishness. The bottom of the pit, up to the Sunday afternoon television standards.
