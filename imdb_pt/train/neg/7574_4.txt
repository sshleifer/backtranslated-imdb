But it has a good deed and a plot that is a little interesting. Nevsky acts as a body builder and he is not as attractive, in fact IMO, he is UGLY. (her acting skills lack everything!) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than the ones she was given, her character needed to be developed. There are many men in this story, there is romance, lots of action and a lot of stupid end. It's too violent. However, I loved the scenery, this movie takes you to the whole world, and that's a bonus. I also liked how I had something about the Mafia, not too much or too little, but enough to get my attention. The actors needed to be prettier ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha is going to be hot enough, but for us women who are fans of action, Nevsky simply does not cut. Overall, this movie was good, I did not love it and I do not even hate it, I just thought it was another normal action movie.
