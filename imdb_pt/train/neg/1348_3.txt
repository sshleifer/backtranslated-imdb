this animated film by Inspector Gadget is pretty ridiculous. The story is very weak and there is little action. Almost all characters receive little or nothing to do. The film is mildly entertaining at best, but it's actually going nowhere and is useless, but just fair and far from the caliber of the 1980s animated TV show. It's not a movie that has a repeat view, at least less in my opinion. It's only about 74 minutes including credits, so I think that's a good thing. Unlike the TV show, the characters are not worth cheering on here. On the show, you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day, but who really cares? Anyway, this is just my opinion. For me, inspector The last case of the gadget is a disappointing 3/10
