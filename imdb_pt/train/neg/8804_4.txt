Great CGI effects and a truly Oscar-winning performance by Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a trick pony in this movie as he received the Oscar for Best Actor that year by Morgan Freeman , was a crime. <br /> <br /> This film is a love letter to the baby boom generation, with a pretense of right disguised right from the service of Forrest in Vietnam to the "resolution" with Jenny at the end. <br /> <br /> With that said though, it's extremely entertaining and an American movie through and through. I found certain parts of this film overly offensive, stupid Zemeckis in this movie almost at the level of Gump himself. . Maybe that was the point he was trying to make. Watch this movie and ask yourself "What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to have made the "right" choices and has been in the "right place at the right time" for the past 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a high price. So Zemeckis is saying that the idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic and even AMERICAN quality?
