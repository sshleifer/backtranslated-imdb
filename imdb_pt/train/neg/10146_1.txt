'Flight Of Fury' is a shocking, but worst of all boring action movie - I do not expect much from a Seagal movie, all I expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some foolish action - unfortunately that does not (which is totally irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing with big holes in the plot, The acting is really lousy - bordering on the embarrassment with Seagal and his Whisper A performance of expression being the best among the mourners of the 3rd Appraisers - I find it hard to believe that something close to $ 12M was spent in this terrible mess, unless $ 11M of those 12 were Salary of Seagal - I doubt it! The only moment of any interest to heterosexuals or gay girls is that apparently nowhere does two hot sexy lesbians end up in a full lesbian sex scene with huge holes on display in addition - it's a mediocre thing that is not unlike many others. the Michael Dudikoff B movies that I suffered <br /> <br /> 1/10
