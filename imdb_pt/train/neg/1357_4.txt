* Can it contain a kind of spoiler? * The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some geeks panties on a hill. His striking appearance in Back to the Future as George McFly has sealed him in American consciousness forever. More recently, he has been trying to return to the subconscious of culture with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin made a 76-minute film. Sometimes I remembered genius, while in general it almost insulted me, but not because of its content. Content? What is it? is a film in which, in a half of the film, all actors have Down Syndrome, giving the feeling of freakshow. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and a guy with cerebral palsy. This all had the feel of what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Living, and simultaneously feeling more successful and failing miserably. <br /> <br /> Half of the Down Syndrome actors also have many dead snails. It's about a guy who has snails and ends up killing one. He is also plagued by a lot of other people and by a grasshopper. He falls in love with two girls, one of whom he has sex in a graveyard. He also has a fight with a friend who provokes him. <br /> <br /> In a strange semi-interior set, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. It is something like controlling the mind of the guy, and cerebral palsy is something like sexuality. Well, at least he masturbates in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" images made funny, like Nazi Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple, and minstrels of black faces saying they are Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the tormentor is still dealing with his love of killing snails and being beaten by other people. They beat him with rocks and such. Later, they overcame the minstrel after putting him on trial. Back inside, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set, and tries to control everyone, but fails miserably. <br /> What is it? makes less sense than Dr. Caligari, and has more than a passing style stolen from him. The claustrophobic mental space looks very much like the way Dr. Caligari's wallless sets looked claustrophobic. They also had some dialogue that was absolute absurdity. And, everything was wrapped up with absurd images of humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is, about 20 minutes in the movie ... maybe a little more ... What is it? without images. In the next 56 minutes, we kept running in the same sets of images, just introducing new images in the form of an absurdistic puppet show. The film seems little more than a movie that tries to push the envelope into offensive images and taboos. He tries to mock and confuse the audience. But the point is that it only has enough different images for a 40-minute movie. Worse still, cinematography, set design and everything else seemed very cheap and almost unpredictable. It seemed "OK, this is how we can do it and get it out of the way". It did not seem interesting, and it was well ... boring. Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, had incredible cinematography and framing. The difference between the two is quite surprising. <br /> <br /> classification: C
