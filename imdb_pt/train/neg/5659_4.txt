A disappointing ending to a season that started off so well ... Exodus part 2 and other notable episodes were among the best seen on TV in any series, where like that was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure if it was the episode that was a disappointment, but the tacky guitar music that accompanied the closing sequence was laughable and would have been more at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if corporate executives do not like the final grade and want to improve. They failed and instead ruined everything. <br /> <br /> We hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> Still, at least we have seen the return of a certain person, albeit somewhat bizarrely and tritely done.
