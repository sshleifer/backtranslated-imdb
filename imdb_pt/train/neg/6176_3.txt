I'm not a big fan of the Stooges' antics, but I find their story interesting. I recently tried checking things out of every Stooge season, but the opportunity to see Joe Shorts does not seem easy; <br /> <br /> Some say the quality problems with Joe's season shorts are not Joe's fault, and I suspect that's the case. Joe as an artist is far from the worst thing about it. What bothers me most has been pointed out in another comment: the pitting of the other guys against the third one rapes the whole comedy-team / Stooges ethos. Maybe Joe's style was perceived by those responsible as something that did not fit-though there were no real conflicts between him and the others-and that was his way of dealing with it. <br /> <br /> And what about the titles of this and some of the other short Stooges? Definitely lacking in creativity there; Was this kind of thing the cause or effect of the shorts market drying up?
