This is an informative movie well done in the vein of PBS Frontline. The problem is that Frontline already made this piece and managed to bring Paul Bremer to tell his side of the story. More troubling is the film's director, Charles Ferguson - a former vice president, being a war supporter until the occupation goes south. What does he think would happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland also went very well until it was confused by these Nazis. And that's how you feel about this movie - an apology for the occupation, rather than a deconstruction of the actual act of war. . Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have gone better - as if any war could be better.
