It's hard to put into words the enormous shame of this movie. An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything, even if remotely recognizable as "humor" or even "entertainment" in Rabbit Test. So, as a small contribution to this future endeavor, I would like to suggest this word: "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of "hubristic" and "great"; used to describe excessively ambitious break-ups like the movie "Rabbit Test". <br /> <br /> Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redack overcame their meager abilities to have fun at this 82-minute misery festival. . Trying to ride a plane! a comedy style with a moldy collection of jokes, (note to Joan: German doctors are not funny since Vaudeville) unearthed from their graves in the Catskills - that's bad enough. But composing this cinematic crime is River's directing style, which can best be described as "ugly," and a cast of once-for-all beacons so eager to please that they exaggerate even the weakest of disposable jokes. <br /> Drifting in this Sargasso Sea of ​​Sap is an unfortunate Billy Crystal in his film-making role as unfortunate protagonist of the movie Lionel. Watching Crystal in this photo is very much like watching a blind person take a walk in a minefield; eventually the shivering reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition like a cheap joke after a cheap joke explodes in his face. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate on the kind of audience that might really like the Rabbit Test. Slightly retarded sprouts, mollusks and lizards are all likely candidates. But for conscious and conscious humans - I would enthusiastically recommend putting bleach in the eye before recommending the "Rabbit Test".
