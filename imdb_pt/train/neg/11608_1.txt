If this guy can make a movie, then I sure as hell can make one too. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This movie did not have any. I think that class B horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I would not want to let my viewers down. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from doing many scenes in which the hero wakes up to discover that it is only a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of those scenes. And considering that the film lasted only an hour, the relationship between the dream and the duration of the film was quite high. And if I decide to make a dream sequence, I'll make sure the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I'm not going to rip any movies like Star Wars or Matrix because I'll know my budget is small and I will not want to mask my contempt for big budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references on them in mine. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a palm rider can only be so scary ... at least they turned him into an evil monster before the screen exploded or something. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count me in: the extraordinary wanna-b movie director.
