This gets a two because I liked it when I was a kid but it became so redundant that I started to hate it ... I can not give a descriptive analysis because that would be to reaffirm one thing after another, I would probably do not say anything that everyone has not already said. <br /> <br /> The only other thing about this show is that it's pretty unpleasant, with the kid with the wound for that distorted babysitter for the stupidity that goes around. and about it. I have a cousin who loves this show and he's the strangest, dumbest person I've ever met. This show must be taken off the air. It's always the same thing over and over ... They need to do better shows on Nick. I'm getting very tired of things like that.
