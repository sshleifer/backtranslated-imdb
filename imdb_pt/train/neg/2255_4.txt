Was this movie stupid? Yes. That depth of the film? No. Character development? No. Reversal in the script? No. This was simply a movie about a highly fictional Springer show. It shows the lengths that some people go to get their mugs on the TV. Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime is .... well ... CUTE! This film was not very made to be an "innovative" film, on the contrary, was destined to life in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone else , all girls get pregnant on different faces, and all guys drive rusty Ford '66 pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention "trailer"). Some people overanalyze movies (case-in-point: Star Trek aberrations). I watch movies purely for entertainment value; to not point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read the article "Goofs" on Connie's shirt.) Could it have been better?
