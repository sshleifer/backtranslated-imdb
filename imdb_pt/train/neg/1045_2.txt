Levant Victor Vargas fails terribly in what he tries to be: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality in this film. The characters and situations seem completely artificial and false. <br /> <br /> The reason? Bad direction. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give him an authentic feel. Wrong! It just gives a bad feeling. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your movie, it just gives the audience a headache and lessens what's on the screen instead of magnifying it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what is on the screen is so painful. as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script for the sole purpose of trying to look "cool" to his friends at Sundance and to show him how he is a "filmmaker." <br /> <br /> Overall, the only lasting impression this movie leaves you with is a bad director, Mr. Sollett. Next time, how about writing some lessons and driving?
