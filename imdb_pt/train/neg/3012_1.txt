The film opens with a long filming of corridors in a factory crowded with workers. Man, what we did for the planet you can think of. I hope we can see other things like that. <br /> <br /> This is very rare. When you are not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator in a classroom, you see him mounting the camera to take pictures in different places. It would be nice if you chose areas more suited to his theme, but he does not. Then, you will hear some more narration, watch some photos and watch him mount his camera. Why not use the camera to show more landscapes? It really kills any sense of rhythm and paints the guy like the dumbest. <br /> <br /> I was able to read tips on how someone set up their camera, move quickly through the whole movie, and waste much less time.
