Amazing. That's what you'd say if you watched the movie. Simply unbelievably incredible. It's really so incredible that someone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you just can not believe what you're seeing. This, my friends, is what is truly scary about this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea to do this. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another incredibly original story: High School Student (occasionally seemed to be from college) goes to a prostitute for a mother, lives in a trailer park and is an "artist" who is ridiculed by his "being all different". Well, of course, that poor kid ridiculed is eventually killed and, here is the original part, his soul inhabits a scarecrow (below which he is killed by his mother's last sucanagem). So he goes around with the standard murder of all the people who hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here's the summary: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - A surprisingly funny movie ?? even if it's not what the clearly drunken filmmakers wanted. <br /> <br /> This is the sequel to a disc at Wal-Mart's $ 5.00 deposit, so it's just a little expensive. <br /> <br /> It did not hurt, Didn't Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and violence are a bit substandard. A person is stabbed with an ear of corn. <br /> <br /> It seems like they put some effort into the song, but it does not fit the movie and it's not that good. /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - terrible, acting terrible. <br /> <br /> - Another slasher disappointed with sexy women ?? none of them removing clothes. When did this stop being a staple of low-brow slashers ?? - ridiculous story. <br /> <br /> - The scarecrow vomits up one-liners that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> - The underlying love story goes nowhere, and it is badly made. <br /> <br /> - Some of the dead people look like they were randomly chosen? you never know who you are and then you're dead. And you just assume they must have come. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - Extremely medium slasher fare, only with a scarecrow killer instead of ?? well, all those other crap. <br /> <br /> It's not as interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, or even Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series - all better than this atrocity. <br /> <br /> The worst absolute dialogue I've ever heard in my life. The script is loaded with a level of delay that I never imagined could exist. I'm serious, it's a step beyond the awful. But do not get me wrong, it's funny how the hell, but I've never heard any more swearing, even in "Slumber Party III Massacre". This film makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The man who kills the boy who becomes the scarecrow: the worst wig ever. Dialogue to combine. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> One in which elementary school kids cite their own witty dialogue: "Hey, let's look for small animals to torture." <br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (No Nudity, the mother is a prostitute, girls do not wear bra) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, mediocre quantity) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, blatant, exaggerated and painful funny so bad it's good My first review for dialogue in any movie!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheese: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Total: 3/10 < Another one for people like me who like to watch sheer crap. Or completers of horror films. This is not a good movie. Ridiculous dialogues and characters prevent it from being really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
