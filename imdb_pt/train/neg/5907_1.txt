Yes, that sums it all up. This movie was horrifying. Two minutes later, I wanted to tear out my eyes. This has been praised as an "innovative LDS comedy", but neither is it good for members of that church! I do not think any human being should be so victimized to watch such a low quality movie. <br /> <br /> First, you can say that absolutely no effort was made for this movie. It seems that the horribly monotonous and banal plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow impregnated with the gift of a coherent (at least semi-coherent) thought. Then there is the acting, which is gloomy of * everyone * involved. Even the cameos can not animate anything. <br /> <br /> And we can not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow idiot that we would like to believe can change, but this road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogues, astoundingly heinous "jokes" and many "inner jokes "Mormons that anyone in his right mind, LAD or not, should consider purely * stupid *! This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
