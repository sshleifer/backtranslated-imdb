In Cold Blood was one of several films of the 60s that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry. Capote coined the phrase "non-fiction novel" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was transferred to the screenplay of the film, which he co-wrote. Despite the fact that we were well into the age of the color film, Richard Brooks chose to present this film in black and white to emphasize both the severity of the landscape and the desolation of history.

This will help you understand the extraordinary effort he has put into the material, as well as some of the controversies surrounding both the book and the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, I only gave a 4 because I saved the bottom 3 rankings for real bombs - the kind that enrage you have been sucked into spending a
