This whole movie should have lasted 45 minutes - at most. Although it is an interesting concept / theme, it did not really develop into a story. Once introduced the initial idea of ​​a brave (stupid?) Specialist in bomb disposal (cowboy?), And this happens very early in the film, the rest is repetitive. The characters were not exploited and aspects of location and politics were ignored. There were some good insights into the terrible difficulties faced by the troops in such a strange environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between the friend and the enemy. But the way the unit operated extended the belief! Individual performances were good and the special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content.
