According to Disney's famous practice of stealing ... I mean ... buying well-known properties and bastardizing them, this live action version of the classic cartoon has to be one of the worst reissues in a bad year re- does. I grew up in the original cartoon TV series. Any episode from the original cartoon series will give you more laughter than this entire movie. Penny's legal computer book is not present. Also not present is the gag with the self-destructive orders that always end up detonating in the Chief. The new one is a convertible Gadget (the original design had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical unrealistic Hollywood novel. Do not stuff the coffers to pay for Disney executives and even your former executives - do not watch this movie. <br /> <br />
