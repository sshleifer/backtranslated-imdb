Luke Benward, 11, as Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester, moves to a new city. In his new school, the young Benward is picked up by the other boys. They put worms in their thermos. Keeping his vomit reflex under control, Benward throws a worm in the face of freckles Adam Hicks (as Joe Guire). Benward bet he can eat 10 worms in one day - no regurgitation! <br /> <br /> High, provoked Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her bow and arrow skills to help Benward. SCTV's director and former screenwriter, Bob Dolman, promises: "No worms were harmed during the production of this film." On a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a funny scene. "How to Eat Fried Worms" is loosely based on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. Pre-teen kids in gross-outs should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> How to Eat Fried Worms (8/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
