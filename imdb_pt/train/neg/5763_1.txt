<br /> <br /> "Move away from the Hollywood veterans?" (the wayan brothers were "asked") that's what hollyweird required and that's what it has. However, like many of his recent decisions, this was a stupid mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is so out of touch with today's audience, trying to bring back the physical traps and jokes instead of funny dialogues. a disaster. I knew the audience knew this, and CAST knew that. <br /> <br /> What a pity, why did not they ever consider changing direction? Not only that, but the two Wayan brothers played as two of the four main characters without them is just a farce and a sad. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
