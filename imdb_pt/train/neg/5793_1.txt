It really was that bad. On parity with the (mercifully!) Short-lived "Dirty Dozen" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made around the same time (also on the cheap in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he did this garbage), and the critic who parallels Telly, the Greek, and John Wayne in "The Green Berets" sums it up. Other critics have pointed out some of the many ridiculous trinkets that this crime against celluloid contains, so I will not repeat them here. But I'll add that I'm surprised no one has mentioned the ridiculously tiny helmet Savalas wears on his big, swollen head. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised that this train movie has a rating as high as 4.7 here in IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's a "1" in front of the board. If you want a good example of why scamming a franchise is really a bad idea (especially more than 20 years after the original) - look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission." <br /> <br /> Horrible - avoid !!!!
