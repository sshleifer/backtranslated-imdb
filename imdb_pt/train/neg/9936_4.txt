I got this for 50 cents at the flea market, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I found it fascinating for about 15 mins then just repetitive and boring. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Mick and his gang at their peak, I wish there was not a lot more dialogue dubbing so I could hear what they're saying and playing. <br /> <br /> The sketches are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, from poorly written Monty Python to acid. I spent more time looking at the late 60s, when England fell, and not what was really happening in the silly skits. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that times really do change, and what was important quickly becomes silly. Good music, but now it has been played to death by this DVD.
