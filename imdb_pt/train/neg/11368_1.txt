This film was more effective in convincing me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim. And I'm Jewish. <br /> <br /> Does anyone go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Rhetoric of the first year? These alarmist statements, presented in a palatable way, can be persuasive. But by offering no recognition of possible opposing arguments, no viable solutions (or in any way), few sources, and each of questionable origin, makes the argument ineffective. <br /> <br /> And, thank God for that - I do not want anyone to leave the theater BELIEVING any of those racist applauses. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and hopefully a cautionary tale for you - to actually read about a movie before you see it.
