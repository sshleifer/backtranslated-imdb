I think this drawing is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I would recommend this cartoon to people under 5 years old. I used to like this show when I was 4 and 5, I still watched when there was nothing. Now I'm another 5 and I'd rather do my homework than watch it. The cartoon used to be a little funny, but they were not enough to make me laugh. Now I am older, I am interested in showing witch are not classified us. I started watching Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things to do with Doctor Who, so I'm not interested in 5-year-old cartoons. This cartoon did not last long, it only had 6 seasons, it was canceled because of the viewers, but some people say it was because the writers run out of ideas, but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons.
