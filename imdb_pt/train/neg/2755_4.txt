This is the saddest collection of cliches, tied together in a straight line, without noticeable plot or any decent way of acting that I have seen in a long time. Cannibalizing scenes from Star Wars, Kingdom of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, went to a total war on the intelligence of the viewer. Was this movie good? It was not a movie! <br /> <br /> Even if it's not as low to be funny and cult status as a comedy, the film offers some laughs. The trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of your original movies. Gandalf can be funny speaking Korean, the basilisk looking snake hilarious if you compare it to a kitten and the evil henchman can provide a lot of fun alternating between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever its name. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Any pleasure derived from this film completely depends on the state of intoxication and imagination of the viewers, not the director / writer. Shame on you, Shim!
