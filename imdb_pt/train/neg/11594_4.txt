Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel has a very strange idea and does not make much sense to extract a story from it. Basically Alice's number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy, who gives her a way out to haunt her friends. This has fewer deaths out of the entire series and the cracks are very bad, so neither horror fans nor comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I do not have much to say about it. It's moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan coming back from four, but it's not worth watching a movie. Uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly just the competitive direction saves him from being the worst in the series.
