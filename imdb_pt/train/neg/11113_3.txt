I often feel like Scrooge, hitting movies that others are raving about - or, I write the review to balance the unwarranted raves. I found this film almost impossible to watch, and, unusual for me, was rapidly advancing not only through boring and clich√©d dialogues, but even boring musical numbers and cliches. Whatever the originality that exists in this film - uncommon domestic setting for a musical, a lot of fantasy, some animation - is more than compensated for by a script that does not have a dash of intelligence or the development of intriguing plots. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be nice people, but they can not take a movie as a team. Neither of them is really charismatic or has much sexual appeal. Both are bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is quite a note. The best part of the film, to me, is June Haver's beautiful outfits and great body.
