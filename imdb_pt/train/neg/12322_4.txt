As it seems to be the general essence of these comments, the film has some awesome animation (I watched it on blu-ray), but it really falls short of any real depth. <br /> <br /> First, the characters are all pretty dull. I have a suggestion of a sort of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola, and the main antagonist, Shunack. However, maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking (Laputa being my favorite animus, original Engelsh). The characters are also not very kind, and as mentioned in another post, they fall exceptionally quickly, leaving the old and poor Minka jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who seems oblivious to that). However, she readily seems to forgive Toola in the end, with no explanation for the change of heart that does not make the end a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanation. Like who are the Druids? Are they people? and who are the weird women / girls who seem to go out with them and run the forest? There is nothing to explain why they are there and how they can give ordinary human superpowers. Plants that come from the moon do not yet fill in the blanks about it. It's almost like a weird version of Triffids Day. <br /> <br /> And who calls Toola? Why bother with it if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, but I thought the plot was not as deep as a movie like Ghost in the Shell or have any real character like those of Miyazaki. I do not resent watching, but I kind of wish I had not bought it. My advice? Take a chance if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow, or buy cheap! Maybe if your new to animate movies and do not have much to go through you will enjoy it. Certainly it is visually pleasing.
