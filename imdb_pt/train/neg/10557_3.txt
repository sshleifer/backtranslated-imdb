It is a small hideous production, capable of giving nightmares and headaches. It's a nasty mix of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of weird and fun trip that someone optimistic can expect. It's cold, inhuman, hostile, disgusting, even scary. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did much more attractive things with stop-motion. <br /> <br /> Curiously, this is a French production. As such, it reinforces the stereotype that the French have no scary concept.
