Despite the great reviews that this film has received in New Zealand, any advertising around the production is, unfortunately, undeserved. In addition to a clichés-only plot, the film is disappointed by some weak performances, accents and general lack of tension. <br /> <br /> Although having the overall look of a large budget (for NZ), the feel is decidedly Kiwi town ... <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen the brothers ?? (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who chose the similarities immediately ... I heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball, etc. were shot to mock the cliché "boys talking crap," but it looks like it was forced ... <br /> <br /> I believe that Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply ironic but again his delivery always seems only vaguely self-conscious . Those who have doubts that the culture of Samoans living in NZ has been profound, hopefully not permanently, affected by discourse, culture and everything that happens between the US will surely have their minds made in the NZ. end of this film. Robbie Magasiva always looks good on screen, but is disappointed by the script .. <br /> <br /> It always disturbs me when a "comedy" has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way, you stay wanting to have a good moan in the cliché of the joke - see what you want to be a white kid ... <br /> <br /> I know someone who found this movie and hilarious - however, this person has the brain of a tadpole, and would fight to spell her name if it was offered a million dollars ... <br /> <br /> It kind of sums up the mentality of this movie, okay, but not great, fun but not funny ..... Awakening NZ - this is not a 5 star movie, despite all the bright (middle-class white guilt ?? :-)) reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice ? if you watch, get drunk first !!!
