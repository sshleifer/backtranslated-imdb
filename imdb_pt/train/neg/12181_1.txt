Unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or so I would have chosen. This movie does not have the star power that the original movie had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn and the expert direction of seasoned professional John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston) is what made this movie so charming. Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this excuse sorry for a sequel. Before making this movie, all that Ashley Johnson was known for was her role as the little Chrissie Seaver in Prime Growing Pains. She had some parts in movies, but I do not know who thought she had enough talent to bring a movie on her own. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! They did not get actors good enough to play key roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but will they hire Joan Collins to play a British lady? No wonder this movie was as bad as it was. Critics were right about not agreeing to this movie, even if it was made for TV alone, it was a poor sequence for an otherwise adorable movie.
