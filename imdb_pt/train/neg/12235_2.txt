If you want to know what kind of music white people heard in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you will also have to listen to many flutes and violins (see my notes in My Girl 1 for reference). <br /> <br /> Indulgent Admission: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance, having just seen its predecessor. But as an adoptee preparing to finally seek out my biological mother, My Girl 2 made me sound like the mother-to-be. In other words, anything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing to do with My Girl 2, but related to a protagonist who asks, like so many adoptees, "who is my mother "? And if there are my mother's home movies in a troupe of actors, I'll make my own movie about it. <br /> <br /> People are inattentive. Movies should not be listless. My Girl 2 (as My Girl 1) is just ... apathetic. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless you are a complete sap, which is comforted by a host of minor hassles.
