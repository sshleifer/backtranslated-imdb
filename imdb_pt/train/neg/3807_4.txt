Do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of many of Woody's films, obviously his 1970s masterpieces (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his dramas of the '80s and early' 90s (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners, Husbands) and wives) I actually even enjoyed some of their latest efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks), but that sucked, though it could not be worse than last year, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was plotted lazily - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes taken - Woody also seems to be coming out, going mad for most of his life. phrases and delivering slogans 'hilarious' 'mean that with all respect ...' more and more until the softness of everything becomes very naked. <br /> <br /> I know most of the actors are in line to work with him, but they should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are way better than that - and Woody really should have one role more back in the role of camera in the future if he has some sense of 20 miles behind him. <br /> <br /> It would not be so tragic if we did not have so many great Woody movies to compare with - but of course his best days are behind him and, judging by this effort, Woody should call him a day before it became an industry joke. <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
