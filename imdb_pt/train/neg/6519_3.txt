Filmed in a documentary style, but you might as well tell the participants that they were trained. A newly divorced film producer (Myles Berkowitz) sees the chance to cheer his love life and get into the movie business at the same time. He plans to make a documentary about finding love by filming twenty dates, including ramifications. The comedy is uneven at best; the rest is an accident after an accident. Also participating are Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and the seductive Elisabeth Wagner. Trying for credibility, the attractive Aunt Carrere is invited to a special participation. This will suffice as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date.
