This movie is not terrible, actually. Someone commented that Mo is the kind of European Americans who smile. But there are those, not necessarily Anglo-Saxons yahoos, who do not care for the French; and the character Xavier will not influence them. <br /> <br /> Let's consider your stereotyped attributes of French: 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, underfed appearance, check, though: <br /> <br /> 3). A great appreciation of the cuisine. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). Warm work ethic. Checks. (Forget the fact that he's supposed to be a wealthy stockbroker, watching him in the movie he seems to put in at ten weekly work hours.) 5). Beautiful wife, check it out. Despite this: <br /> <br /> 6). Loose interpretation of marriage vows. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). Big sexual ego, that says an American girl owes sex to you if you buy her dinner. Check. <br /> <br /> If Mo is a hick or not, there is no reason for her to fall in love with this European fool beyond the script. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, like other male reviewers, I enjoyed seeing the beautiful and delicate body of Karen Allen. I'll give the movie four stars; two of them are for that.
