This movie was kind of interesting ... I had to watch it for a college class on India, however, the synopsis says that this movie is about one thing, when in fact it does not contain much cool information about these details. Not really synopsis to the end where they try to tie all the elements together. The gore factor is excellent, though. Even at the beginning, you want to look away because the blood is very intense. Just watch this movie if you want to see a little cold-blooded because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted listening to it. I've seen rumors on other sites about this movie being based on actual events, however you can not find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
