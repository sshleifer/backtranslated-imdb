Maybe not, but it's horrible. Even the fantastic cast can not save you. Okay, I'll admit it started very funny, but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the Generals' house. Bill Murray ceased to be a comic and humorous guy in an idiot who shouted things at people on the street that were not funny, it's like he's trying very hard to be funny. His character stole a gun (a trailer? Come ...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing God knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and stupid they are, though not intentionally. I really was disgusted that this kind of crap advertisement could actually be released.
