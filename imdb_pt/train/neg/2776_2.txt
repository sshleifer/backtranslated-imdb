The King Maker is a film about a series of real events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the film still does not impress the viewer. . The performance, in particular, was extremely poor. Some of the actors are struggling to let the tears fall and the accents, real and false, are extremely annoying. The plot was also very dumb and very stupid to be true and seemed more like a history lesson. The film could not even capture this kind of real, centennial air, and it looked more like a failed attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> The final say? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the performance was extremely poor and the actors could not even give natural outbursts of emotion. In short, the film sounded more like a lump than a script.
