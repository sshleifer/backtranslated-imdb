The Hollywood Hotel was the last musical film that Busby Berkeley directed for Warner Bros. His style of direction has changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his suspended shot signatures or large production numbers with thousands of extras. In the late 1930s, big swing-style bands were recording the greatest popular hits of the year. The Age of Swing, also called the Big Band Era, was dated from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to pinpoint exactly when the Swing Age began, Benny Goodman's engagement at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the earliest signs that swing was entering the consciousness of America's youth. When Goodman presented his swing repertoire instead of the society-style music that his band was playing, the young people in the audience went crazy. That was the beginning, but like radio, live concerts and word-of-mouth were the main methods available to spread the phenomena, it took some time for the swing to make enough inroads to produce big hits that popped up in the charts pop In Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Raymond Paige and His Orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was poised to capitalize on the change in musical taste (the film was in production only a year and a half). after Goodman's Palomar Ballroom engagement). There are some interesting musical moments here and there at the Hollywood Hotel, but, except for Benny Goodman's "Sing, Sing, Sing" and His Orchestra, there is not much to recommend. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the "Hooray for Hollywood" opening parade and the production number "Let That Be a Lesson to You" at the drive-in restaurant. The film is very interesting to see and hear Benny Goodman and His Orchestra play and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.
