We should have been suspicious to find that with only two minutes to turn out the lights, we were the only ones there. Only five others joined before the movie began. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to redeem this movie. The acting is horrible (especially Ms. Hurley). The script is banal. The effects we saw a million times. The movie directs the worst we've ever seen. Meandering and disconnect. No one even laughed at the children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would have been sooner if my wife had not gone after a hot dog !!! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie. If there's nothing left to watch in your movie theater, buy some hot drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and get some people to watch. You will have a much more enjoyable time !!! <br /> <br />
