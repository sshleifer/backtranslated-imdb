A film as bad as this should be taken from every store in the world. So full of boring, monotonous and unimaginative characters, and with a main character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice constantly giving a thoughtless voice to every action and feeling, this movie holds the record for the most challenging film I have ever seen. As I paid money to own it, I felt the duty to go through it and how I regret it. My head hurt because of the dreadfully dull and meaningless characters, it makes fewer lives. A bunch of children who have no knowledge of anything, are all cold and, worst of all, have terrible dialogue, just thinking while the main character tries to get a date with the girl. Annoyed so much that my friend was shaking with hatred and I was red with embarrassment at having thrown out Â£ 6. The DVD was on eBay the next day, and I did not get back much of my money. Avoid like the plague.
