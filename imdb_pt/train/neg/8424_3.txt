This film can be judged from three points of view: as story, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> He fails as history, mentions in passing the coup that threw away Obote, the expulsion of the Asians, and has Entebbe as the background, but not in any chronologically consistent timeline. As a profile of Amin, it may have been interesting, because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if this was a better movie, he would win an Oscar. (He did it - which proves that Oscar voters do not watch the movies they vote for). He ignores the relevant historical episodes of the novel, which observed Amin and the history of Uganda from the doctor's point of view. Instead, it tells the fictional story of the Scottish doctor and his love life impossible from Amin's point of view. But the story told is the only incident that Amin was probably innocent. As a fictional thriller, there is no plot to keep it together. The beginning is tense - it takes cinematic liberties with romance, but sets the story. The character of the doctor is well defined, but gets lost in the second half of the movie that suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala is poorly explained - seduced by power? Because he becomes a friend, no one is strange. The friend's character in the novel was lost because the Scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor - a ridiculous tangle that does not seem at all believable, but allows the screenwriters of the film to show Amin's ferocity around. . The man named bit horse at the end is laughable. <br /> <br /> Finally, in 1971, Uganda headed left, not right, the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the prey of Ecuador?! <br /> <br /> In short - if you've never heard of Amin, you might want to spend two hours watching this movie to enjoy the performance of Forest Whitaker, but the last minute will leave you confused. If you know Uganda or read the book - do not watch the movie - it will only depress you. And if you wanted to know why the doctor was so reckless - he was not.
