I have this movie in the $ 5 box at Walmart. I would not recommend watching this move. I can give it to one of my friends if I'm mad at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and took a look at the summary and thought it was a war movie. I'd like to know how annoying this movie would be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think that something would happen in this movie. It's just about a group of people going from one training camp to another. The training sergeants treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people out of the fight in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Ok, here is my speech about this movie: For me, this movie is slow and difficult. watch. It was just one of those movies that you put on and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off, but its hanging in a string of hope it can catch up to the end. Do not do. After the movie was over, I went through it behind my TV because I was angry for having lost almost two hours of my life watching, and another 10 minutes writing this article to warn people about it.
