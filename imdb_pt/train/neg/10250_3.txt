Thriller of cheap and bland science fiction, made with an almost total lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is directed by only ONE MAN and is very badly kept at night) and full of exaggerated sound effects. Christopher Lee is not just a waste, but he also gives one of his few "I'm here strictly for the money" performances. (* 1/2)
