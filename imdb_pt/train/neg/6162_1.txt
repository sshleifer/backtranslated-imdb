"Smokey And The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but no one wanted it to be. It was a lowdown clown, but it had brains. He had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun ending. The people left the theater smiling. "Hooper" does not provide any of this. No reason to smile. If it's supposed to be a tribute to the Hollywood stuntman, it makes them seem awfully lazy, offering nothing but poorly choreographed fighting scenes and one of the most unconvincing car jumps I've ever seen. Everything seems false, barely filmed almost on purpose. Poor Sally Field (like the girlfriend who twists her hands behind the scenes) gets her weaker role, with no funny or clever lines ("If you do, I will not be here when I get back"). Burt Reynolds keeps looking at the camera and blinking, but the joke is in any audience that sits through "Hooper". * in ****
