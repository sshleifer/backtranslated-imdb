The latest rumor circulating is that Vh1 is beginning to make calls to I Love New York in the middle of 2008. So does that mean that Budah or Tailor made the dump of New York or does that mean that New York abandoned the winner? <br /> <br /> I know that Flavor of Love is coming to Season 3, so now with a Flavor of Love 3 and I love New York 3 ..... will it be a real winner? <br /> <br /> I also heard some rumors that Chance will be brought back to Season 3 of I Love New York !!!! I also heard rumors that New York will be specially featured in Flavor of Love 3. <br /> <br /> I hope this has not been a big spoiler for the end of I Love New York 2 .... I'm just stating the latest rumor.
