This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas is not, but it's one of the best crime movies ever made. This movie should be considered closer to STING Part2 or maybe Speed ​​Zone. Remember those jewels! The only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the following cult of the original. This movie did not have everything that De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked so much. There was no sympathetic character and this is the fault of all those responsible for this. I hope RISE TO POWER will win every possible RAZIE and maybe invent some new categories to make it a record. After I watched this S @ * T FEST movie, I sat down and watched Carlitos' original way of taking the bad taste out of my mouth. After watching this, I would like Pachanga to come and kill me from my misery.
