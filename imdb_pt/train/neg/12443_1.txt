"Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures was meant to be a parody of the 1950s science fiction films. I understand none of this should be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of this works. A parody should be funny and this one is not. Not once during the entire run time did I smile. In general, I enjoy myself easily, but I could not find a piece of entertainment anywhere in the Invasion of the Creatures of the Stars. <br /> <br /> I knew I was in trouble from the beginning. The two "stars" make their appearance on the screen with one of the most horrible jokes imaginable - a water hose they can not control and that leaves them wet. These two leave as aspiring Bowery Boys. Why would anyone want to imitate the act and the persona of the Bowery Boys is beyond me. After the less than illustrious beginning, the film continues to feature comedic sequences of chase, Indian dancing, vegetable men, decoder rings and other bland chunks. It's all a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> I bought this on the double DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. This movie is Oscar winner in comparison to Invasion of the Star Creatures.
