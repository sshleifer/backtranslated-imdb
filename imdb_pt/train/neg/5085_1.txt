this movie starts with a common funeral ... and insists so much on this common funeral that I lost interest in 5 minutes of watching, and I started skipping scenes. it seems to me that whoever made this film is distressed to the point of being trapped in a permanent morbid trance, unable to contemplate anything but death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of Southpark's black kids, I want a movie that within 10 minutes let me get into an interesting story, I'm not going to sit and watch 10 minutes of anything other than preparing for a funeral .. my grandmother in her later years was fascinated by funerals, perhaps she could have liked this "movie".
