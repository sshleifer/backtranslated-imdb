First of all, let me tell you that the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks superb and the CGI is reasonably done. It's a shame the rest of the movie is a disappointment, <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /> <br /> From the scene of we can see that this film is un-American, normally this kind of stereotype does not bother me (we English, we have enough of Hollywood), but here the idea of ​​making Americans stupid is not subtle here. This goes beyond the point of realism and his left wondering if a Yankee raped the mother director. <br /> <br /> The scene of mourning was very poor and the part of the movie where it starts to go down hill. <br /> <br /> Here, we are introduced to the Olympic medalist aunt and drunk uncle who enter the memorial and begin to blame the father for the death of his daughter, then beat him before they all started to roll on the floor crying. Unrealistic linkage in times of crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole side line of viruses is ridiculous. If Americans know there are no viruses, why are they wasting time, money and resources investigating? The US government agent orders an innocent Korean's brain to be drilled for nothing, making Americans look wicked (or stupid), not helped by the fact that this guy is voracious by comic effects. <br /> <br /> The movie is about hunting the monster. American and Korean special forces are assigned to find the creature, although throughout the film they are invisible. The only people who hunt the monster, all over Korea, are the main family and some random bum who appears at the end to save the day! Of course, some US / Korean agents try to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> Sister was only included in the film so she could make the vital shot at the end. It was cliché, you knew it was going to happen, but to make matters worse she does everything up to that part! and my final annoyance, how the hell did that boy survive in the end? the monster was swimming with his head underwater for about 5 minutes! Why did not the monster eat the kids in the first place?
