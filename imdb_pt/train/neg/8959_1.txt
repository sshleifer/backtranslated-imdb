Some people may consider this film a work of art - to be able to express their imagination in the film, in order to create a movie full of antagonistic pain and death. I personally think this movie is such a disgust, it should never have been released. . This movie is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a complete waste of time, but it also leaves you sick during the days to come. The shocking images shown in the film not only make you understand the air, but they stay in your mind and take days to forget them. It's a shame that people waste their imaginations on such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and resolution.
