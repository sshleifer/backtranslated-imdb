Merry madcaps in London stage a treasure hunt, with a young woman inadvertently repairing her political father married to a strong, independent woman who has never been in love. Intriguing initial vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, playing an aviator from Amelia Earhart who was too self-involved to give herself to any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted the book by Gilbert Frankau) were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view, but why are all the old cliches kept intact as frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the kind of weeping, crying wife who takes her to bed when things go wrong, and Hepburn's final scene is another bore. A curious artifact, but not a classic for Kate's watchers. ** in ****
