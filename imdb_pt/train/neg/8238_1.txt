This movie was positively the worst movie I have ever watched. I could not sit with the whole thing. I also think the writer must have some weird fetish for women to puke vomiting and shitting ... I mean what was all this! I can not believe this was still done and I am disgusted at having #ingwasted a Â£ 4 rental fee. The quality of the image and the sound are terrible, the acting ... well does not exist. It was a bad excuse for a movie and the scenes of pee, crap and vomit were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh ....... AVOID ALL THE COSTS! The girls seemed to have been taken off the street and only got the paper because they would be willing to take off their blouses ... While these girls have cool bodies, they certainly did not make up for the fact that their screams were horrible unconvincing and a pain to my ears . <br /> <br /> This was like (possibly worse) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey no need for a set as everything seems to spin around in a car! <br /> <br /> Definatey not one to buy staff. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think that I can save someone else losing their money as I have.
