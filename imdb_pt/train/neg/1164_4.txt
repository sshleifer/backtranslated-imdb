I do not know where to start, so I'll start with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie. "Alive combines the tension of the Cube of Vincenzo Natali with the own Versus of Kitamura." I did not see Versus, so I can not comment on that, but I think Cube was an excellent movie that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case, someone clearly confused "tension" with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I will move on and spoil the whole plot, because apart from being a sacred Swiss cheese of a plot, it is also moldy cheese, and the film is not worth spending in any time, even if you do not know the plot beforehand, so it does not matter. If I misunderstand the plot, do not hit me - it's probably because I had to fight to keep my eyelids open. <br /> <br /> Thus, the American military in Nevada lost a UFO in the Nambi desert. This apparently makes sense because they are both deserts so surely they are pretty much the same place. Different Continents or not. A monkey invaded the UFO and acquired an alien that was passed to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. Whatever. The alien thing is now passed on to anyone who is "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the current host. The Japanese army wants to use it for military stuff, so they decide to make it switch from the current host (the researcher's daughter) to another guy. But instead of just picking someone out of the army, who is full of bloodthirsty people and already on the military side, they decide it's probably a good idea to pick some criminal off the death row. Oh, and the reason they choose this death row criminal is because he was the first person in history not to die from non-lethal electric shock which is the standard method of execution because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they are electrocuted . I do not know if they do this so they can laugh in the teachers room about how everyone dies, even if it is not deadly, or if they just want to cut down on electricity bills. <br /> <br /> So the film becomes what the Matrix would have been if it had been really lame, and the superfluous fight saddens us for what seems like an hour. And wait, now they remember that they already had a guy who was infected with the alien thing, so the whole movie up to that point was actually a total loss of time and also human lives. Then everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> The only time in the movie that I did not want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich was when a guy was stuck to a wall by a barrel in his chest. , and he is walking around and another guy goes by. The guy hanging on the wall says "I'm in pain, shoot me". And the living guy looks at him, and it's not like he's an evil guy or anything, so he really looks sad and does not want the guy on the wall to suffer. Then he shoots him. <br /> <br /> (Rhetoric pause) <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "GEE THANKS TO FREAKIN 'HEAP."
