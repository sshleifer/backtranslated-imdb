The "documentary," and we use this term loosely, apparently, sums up that Muslims are trying to dominate the world violently. It then states that any Muslim who does not admit it is ignorant of their own faith or lying in their face! Also every person who is interviewed in the movie has found a market for their ridiculous view of reality, selling clapboards to conservatives willing to let others think for them. What the West NEEDS to know is that this is nothing more than propaganda for mental dwarves. If you are looking for a documentary about Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that gives you multiple points of view from qualified sources.
