The Descent plot, if it really can be called a plot, has two notable events. One near the beginning - one at the end. Together, these events represent perhaps 5% of the total time of the film. Everything (and I mean _all_) is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes. I like disturbing movies, I like dark movies and I do not get disturbed by dark scenes - but if you expect me to feel 60 minutes of hazy / dark scenes (literally) without the story, you have something else to come. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, is completely lost here. And no, she does not get naked, not even in the NC-17 version, which I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you have a couple of hours to play outside and want to watch "Descent", take a nap - you will probably have more interesting dreams.
