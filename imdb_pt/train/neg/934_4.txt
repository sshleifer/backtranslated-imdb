Macy, Ullman, and Sutherland were as good as usual. Ritter was not bad at all. What her name was as beautiful as usual. It could have been a good movie. To bad, the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, banal and annoying. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was presented as a child's painting by the routine of numbers. The characters were pieces of cardboard cut out. There was nothing new or interesting to say and it completely outshone the performance, which was a shame. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was a pity that the screenwriter was not the victim. Especially with the child's "early" lines, which were completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Once again, it is only the performance that prevented a much lower score.
