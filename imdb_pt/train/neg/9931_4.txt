"Black Angel" is a minor whodunit, with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (the husband of the murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has an ungrateful role as a suspect. This noir movie looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never getting anything special. It is pleasant enough, but then at some point it ceases to make sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those great "give me some time" reactions. That ending alone could have sunk the film completely, but what precedes the conclusion is also not very good. Vincent is a weak heroine and Duryea has never been very good at playing good men. I love movies noirs, but this was a real disappointment.
