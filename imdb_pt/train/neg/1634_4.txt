BEGIN SPOILER: Very funny and memorable for the literal scene of cheap Chong smoking: Chong coldly scrubs a kitchen cockroach lost in the bowl of his pipe, lights up, coughs and poops violently for an apparent eternity, then with perfect aplomb and without skip a beat, re-load the bowl correctly, reappear, re-tokes. END SPOILER. Oh, I started to lose faith less than half the process. It occurred to me that the indifferent duo is very unpleasant and less than understandable. I began to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary drug addicts, Harold and Kumar. I simply prefer brighter company. However, the film is probably a perfect fit for roast frat bros or those viewers who are so weak in spirit that they are fooled by a junkie when they - the former are sober. Remarkable appearance of Paul Reubens gushing obscenities in the pre-Pee-wee form.
