Whew What can be said about Gymkata that has not yet been? This is nothing but pure purity from beginning to end. If you want a movie that will keep you on the ground laughing, this is the perfect movie to start. From the combination of Cabot's wild thong and style to Parmistan (and it's four billion assorted ninjas), everything about this movie smells like crap. Directed by Robert Clouse, the infamous mind that brought him the mirror scene in the game of Bruce Lee's death, he once again shows his complete lack of directing talents. Some other faces you probably will not recognize will also appear for your enjoyment, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, although you do not remember them or worry about them after the movie is over. Supposedly based on a book called "The Terrible Game", that if I could find a single trace of its existence anywhere I'd be interested to read it, to see where that went wrong. Instead, the book is apparently an invention of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something Clouse invented to sell his stupid idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this one and the Yakmallah by itself. It's easily one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot.
