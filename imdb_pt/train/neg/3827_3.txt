West stereotyped, derivative, non-original and boring. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) perform performances that are far from being the best, and justifiably; both have superficial roles and character traits expressed mainly through dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "liked the world better than he used to be before" and Coburn is an outlaw who "owes something to the man who locked him in and has to pay his debt." In addition, Heston is so old that he has difficulty riding horses and Coburn is cruel and cruel, but he is not a cold-blooded killer like some of the little villains. Apparently, the filmmakers failed to come up with an original idea on how to make this film distinctive. (* 1/2)
