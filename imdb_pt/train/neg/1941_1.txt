I can not believe I lost five hours of my life with this crap. The previous offer of five days by this author was very enjoyable and I was really looking forward to it. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit since she mumbled or babbled her lines, but most of the rest of the cast followed suit. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old adepts whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to the productions before they are transmitted to ensure that the dialogue is audible? As a result, I suppose I lost track of what was happening and, as the original plot seemed to metamorphose into the standard thing between us and the Muslims, I soon lost interest. The end was a complete anti-climax. A complete failure.
