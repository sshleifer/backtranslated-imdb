I just have to add, in case someone really reads this and has not quite reached the point yet. These other critics are not joking, this is the worst color film you'll probably see. When the movie started, I could not believe that something like that really came to the world to see. <br /> <br /> They are not just saying this when they say it looks like a home movie. It really does. As the "director" took the family's hi8 camcorder (before DV cameras and non-linear computer edition), no other equipment (lights, sound equipment, etc.) picked up some decent-looking students and went out to record a movie . No script, just making it up as he went on. <br /> <br /> When I watched, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one audio channel (left of the right speaker). At first I thought I had gone wrong. The film was silent until someone spoke for a few minutes. I got up and moved to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects, but then I could not hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they are good, sort of thing. I'm not sure if this is one of those. I mean, I admit being a beginner filmmaker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go there and prove you can do better, you know. But watching it only made me feel sorry for who did it. <br /> <br /> As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about it. I thought the girl was hot and was disappointed by the brevity of her bath scene. A little bit of T and A of her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. But, unfortunately, no. If you want to make a movie, but it's turning into trash, throw some free nudity. He worked for Roger Corman.
