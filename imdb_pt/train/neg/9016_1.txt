Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi movie (although I think it's now called Syfy?) Original movie I've seen. But I've seen one or two others since then, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but this one really shaves the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is done poorly, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the end is unexpected and out of place (if you've ever seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean; comment). In addition, there was a musical melody that was used in practically every dangerous sequence. That was really stupid; they just played it over and over again. And it's definitely not original; I know I've heard it somewhere before (I can not remember where). This is one to avoid.
