I wanted to watch this movie since it was first announced on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see last night at 7:40. I'm sorry for the day I lost my ticket to this junk when I could see something better. The beginning was a whole bunch of sex rubbish and cliches. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereo type. The boyfriend was very stupid for his age. The gas that the pregnant girl continued to have barely managed to laugh. The bank robbery was completely annoying with jokes that were used in other movies. Their escape car was an old Chevy van that they claimed had no breaks. Hey, why did not they get a good kid's vehicle for theft? This may have boosted public opinion about the film. This movie was very low low low low budget since nothing there was damaged or destroyed. This movie had many things that would make Christians crazy. Hey, I even expected a car chase scene, because all the movies that steal banks have car chases but me, but there was never any. So I rate this movie b which means low budget and 1 out of ten stars.
