Unfortunately I made a mistake and paid 7 euros at the movies to watch this shallow, meaningless movie. My points; <br /> <br /> The movie is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic viewpoint: As with most American films, the writer considers himself an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it is not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods does not make a person understand a culture. For example, shaving is the sign of clean living in Asia, but everyone was trying to get the girl to stop it. The Lebanese are Christians (Okay, they understood that) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not do ethnocentrism. So we did not judge people after the first question about our life as the father figure did throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Sexual revolution of a girl: There is not much to say about it. Show me 10 girls who had this in their sexual awakening of what I'm going to say I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre. Please watch Dr. Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A dark humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience on the funny parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film?
