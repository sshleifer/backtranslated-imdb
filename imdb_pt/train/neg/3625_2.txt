This is a film that belongs firmly to the 50's. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute has chosen this for one of the 100 best American films of all time. I've seen practically every movie on this list, and this is by far the most disappointing of them. Musical numbers (and many, many of them) are VERY time consuming and boring, and have no connection to history. The ending of the film has a horribly long ballet sequence, which of course has no real relation to the movie's history. It must be admitted that it is very well done, that the music is good and that the dance is done to the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason for the sequence to be included in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is extremely childish and unpleasant and behaves in a poorly polished way. Your mental age is about 14. If you want to see a good musical made in the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Singing in the Rain".
