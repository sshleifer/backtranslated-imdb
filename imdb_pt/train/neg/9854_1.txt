This documentary (or should I say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous people can be when they have full enthusiasm for something like that. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. It is not science, it just destroys. However, something positive in that was the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of the information contained in this mockumentary were totally false, and this is really disappointing because it came from scientists, so that's the reason why it deserves one of 10 and not a 0. An example of false information would be the idea of ​​hydrogen: It is true that, according to Chemystry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to be produced in such proportions, so in this case, you need a good explanation of what actually happens in a dragon's stomach. There are many substances with hydrogen in nature, but not what is needed for an animal to fly aloud, and hydrogen does not appear out of nowhere, so it is impossible. Anyway, there is really something worse, the platinum idea: this element is harder to find than gold, and I can not explain how the dragons survive depending on that. It's ridiculous, they present dragons as creatures with little chance of conquering planet Earth, but of course that at least this explains why they were extinct. Cryptologists probably call themselves scientists, but they are not. People like them tell lies as in this mockumentary, and what is worse, some people buy. But I do not think a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after watching this. These fake scientists waste their time.
