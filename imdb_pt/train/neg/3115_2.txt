I rarely write a negative comment for this site, but this time I felt fulfilled. Night Listener is undoubtedly one of the most dull movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was nothing happening in this movie, which does - I did not care about any of the characters, I did not buy anything. for the whole mystery-type plot, he did not care how he ended up ... nothing. <br /> <br /> There is no comedy, no action, no emotion, no suspense, nothing. Highlights include (no spoilers - there's nothing to spoil): a man climbing a window, a dog barking outside a hotel room, a car passing some rough terrain, and a truck beeping its horn. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "One Hour Photo" and waited for a similar and strange role of Williams, but unfortunately was very disappointed. What is most disappointing is that I'm sure there's a good movie somewhere - the idea was interesting and I should have felt sympathy for the characters, but it just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I could have even given 1/10 but this score is reserved for the remake of The Producers
