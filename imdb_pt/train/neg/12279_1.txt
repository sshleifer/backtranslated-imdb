Although this seems to be a pretty old show (2002), I watched my first episode last night and I have to say it has to be the worst show ever. . . <br /> <br /> I'm not to comment, but I was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to give in, and I'm just assuming that this was your target audience, children under 12 years old or people with IQ below average. <br /> <br /> The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines, I tried to include ALL possible suppositions and all the while trying to preach about friendship, family, religion, and politics !!!. <br /> <br /> Basic story they covered in the episode: Frat House Wrong Wrong Wrong With Too Much Alcohol - Death It ends up being the Senators son who wants the FBI to investigate. The senator thinks he could be his sworn enemy and best childhood friend who did so because the senator was accepting money for his votes for legislation, but eventually got a conscience and said "no" to say millionaire millionaire. Everyone a suspect, but everyone has the usual alibi (ex-girlfriend girlfriend fucking a married teacher had to lie, disgruntled student who was reported by the victim actually had life-changing experience, enemy senators do not pay pupil desperate to kill sworn enemies son, he gives money freely to many bankrupt students). All the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece getting "this age" and has a crush on a boy, with whom she eventually dares to talk with the help of her aunt, but only to drop it because 'in' girls says that he is not good enough and so to continue with them, he knocks him down. Do not worry, she comes back with the boy after she discovers the truth about life and the girls 'in' drop her, Aunty also explains that God is the only one she can really trust (I was almost sick this time) <br /> <br /> This 'drama' gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is. . . You'll laugh at it, I'm sure. . . <br /> <br /> He is one of the Brotherhood boys who only a year ago discovered that he was adopted and that his real father is an international terrorist and he is trying to impress real daddy by killing a boy and planting a bomb at the funeral . . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard action is cardboard continuity is cardboard history is cardboard Anyone who says they love this show has cardboard for a brain <br /> <br /> Why the writers of this show music tried to fit every eventuality into a show means that they obviously have no faith in the character's development or ability of actors to perform a simple plot. Watching this show is like watching 'Last Action Hero' with Arnie killing 5,000 people with a toothpick, except that Arnie is a better actor (wow, I never thought there would be a day when I would say that !!) > In the words of the beloved character of the Simpsons, 'face of the comic book'. . . . WORST TELEVISION. . . . . EVER.
