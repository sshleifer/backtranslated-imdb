I was expecting much better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Prequela very boring for the main series. After the first 30 minutes, I was waiting for it to end. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, retribution, etc ... There are gangsters, types of mafias, who perform hits. However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to make up for the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some useful advice when watching movies: As a general rule, if there is too much exploration titillation then you know that the movie will be a failure. Caprica has a lot of that. The director / writer often tries to compensate for his poor abilities by playing some naked bodies. It never works and all it does is demean the (very) young actresses involved and feel sorry for them. Directors / copywriters who do this should be banned from the deal. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour and a half, by all means, rent Caprica. There's free porn on the Net if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise, go ahead, nothing to see here.
