This movie does not even deserve one. This was a complete waste of time. It was a waste of film and money. It was not offensive, but everything was provocative and disgusting. My spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone. There is full frontal nudity and filthy language. But not only that, there is no plot, the actors are terrible, the accents are horrible, the actors are little time and I was even excited to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I rented was to Brian van Holt (who has only a part of fifteen seconds, by the way). I think this may have been a mistake in the parts of directors and editors, but they repeated the same segments two or three times, adding only one new sentence. <br /> <br /> A movie similar to this is Eraser Head, possibly the most disturbing movie in existence. There is no plot and it is not funny. Although not trying to be funny. DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE.
