Certainly NOMAD has some of the best riding scenes, swords and delightful landscape cinematography you'll probably see, but that's not what makes a good movie. This helps, but the story has to shine on top of these things. And that's where the Nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The story is flamboyant, giving the impression that it was cast simply to make a "cool" movie that "looks" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region where this story goes (and it's blatantly obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If the filmmakers want to involve us in a culture like the Jugars and the Kazaks, they are much better at using actors who act like the role. Warrior tribes, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, a loving interest that separates our "heroes" are all touched but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will leave them side in favor of the next battle sequence, the next scene of action horses or the stunning beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that there have been some significant changes made to the Nomad during his filming, specifically the director and the director of photography. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (director of photography) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have the best eye since her views of the lands made the final cut we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, moving to Bodrov as a director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I see here, the focus is on the battles and not the people, which I feel comes from the eyes of Bodrov and not of the Passer. A real farce. <br /> <br /> The most shameful aspect is that this could have been a really fantastic movie, with a focus on characters and actions. Unfortunately, the superiors apparently decided that the action was what was necessary and took the cheap exit (intellectually speaking). <br /> <br /> Although I can not give this film a positive rating, it pays to watch simply for the incredible work of cinematography. But that's all.
