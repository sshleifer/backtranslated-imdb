This movie is so bad it hurts. The car doing 30 mph when it's supposed to go 100 ... the shift lever that's stuck (in Park!), The nurse who drives for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on the shoulder ... can not either of the 2 idiots pick up That damn phone? There is nothing credible about this crap. I would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this!
