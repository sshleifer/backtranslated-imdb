In a film that follows an actor in difficulties, interpreted, evidently, by an actor in difficulties, this does not favor Chris Klein. He strives to bring anything memorable to the role and snakes through the shallow script, managing to show, what could only be described as, a bland man. The story does exist, but that's all, and it shows no basic beginning, middle, and end, and the viewer shrugs his shoulders feeling that nothing in the last hour and three quarters actually happened. <br /> <br /> A bright light in the middle of this is Fred Durst, who manages to stand out above his seemingly moderately talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the character back from Legde to life. If Fred can recreate this when working with a high-caliber cast, it will still be possible to see him, but I will keep an eye on him in the future.
