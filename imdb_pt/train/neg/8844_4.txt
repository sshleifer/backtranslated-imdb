I watched this movie after seeing other comments about the IMDb, even convincing my wife that it was a "unique horror movie." I wanted to like this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> The "love story" was good, but the horror aspect was very bad. If the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasitic, then it would have been a better movie. <br /> <br /> The call center extended credulity beyond the limits, in fact, It was very ridiculous. The doctor happily ignores the privacy and professionalism laws. A nurse enters a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient (without security escort), and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason. The forensic patient (and the movie villain) is tied up in a fully dressed standing position - apparently for years? None of this makes much sense. <br /> <br /> The film still had some actors that I liked in other things, like the detectives, but I still can not recommend this movie.
