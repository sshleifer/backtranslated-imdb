I just stumbled on this movie channel surfing. my first reaction was: 'oh god not again!' It's so hip to play a retard these days has become pretentious and downright contemptuous. For some reason, however, I stayed and watched until the end. maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping they would give me something to celebrate. <br /> <br /> And certainly, Ken and Helena can take action. Also, the movie progresses into something better towards the end and really makes a point. Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with her character. Jane has a bad side that she uses to keep away and repel pity. then again, she has a soft side that is just looking for love. the only thing that surprised me even more was branagh's character ... this was a triumph of acting, the film itself is nothing special. <br /> <br /> see if you are a student acting ... if you are in search of pure fun, you can skip this one. It's sean penn serious! Oh my, that was a bit harsh, he brings some jokes ... not to the escapists.
