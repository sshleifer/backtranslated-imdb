Sheesh! What a horrible movie. The dishonest camera job, a script with more corn than Kellogg's, and acting so loud you could open a pig farm with it. <br /> <br /> To crown it all, he does not know in which target audience - do we have Cornel Wilde - or Corny Wilde? - entering your soapbox on the dangers of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette, baby, oh dear, and in another strange scene we have the villain, Lobo, forcing yours, aham, if you want, 'man friend 'to make a striptease dressed in a bikini. Try to explain this to the children ... Add a Treasure Island-cum-Jaws type plot, and the result is such an unintentionally funny movie, which is enjoyable - I should not expect a DVD from special edition coming soon, however.
