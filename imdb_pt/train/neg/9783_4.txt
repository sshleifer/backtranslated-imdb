It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not very good either. I myself am a paintball player, I used to play a lot of airball and going from forest to airball is a big change. The film portrays similar qualities. First of all the movie starts with this team who is apparently trying to film this "Phantom" guy or whatever, they seem to be a professional team and wear shirts and toss magazines, autocockers. A guy sporting a thick one. Not too wrong with the movie, but more as it is perceived that it was very tacky. A bunch of guys who are the good guys are players who do not seem to have a lot of money and dream of winning "better weapons." Another team constantly picks them up and insults them because they play from kills and blah blah blah. The ghost helps these guys from the mataqueiro train them and all that crap, he makes them play ball and basically defeats all teams including the pros. <br /> <br /> So, what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well, budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie would not be bad, but the budget is very low and the movie looks like it was made by an amateur. There are no big names in this film and the acting is very tacky. The perception of paintball is also very bad. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all that other crap. It was just a bad movie in my opinion and does not give a real perception of what paintball is. To be honest, true paintball is not all kind of comrade, it's a bunch of profanity and ball bonuses that do not "respect" and play by the rules. Do not watch this movie and expect to go to a field shouting "4 is 1 !!"
