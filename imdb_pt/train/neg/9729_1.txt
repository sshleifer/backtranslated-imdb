Seriously, what is this? Hooper made classic movies like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so he made this movie horrible, what happened? he plunged into the crack a little too much? This movie is about a guy called Sam who has the ability to burn things, (Firestarter, anyone?) The acting was wonderful, the plot was rubbish, and the special effects were extremely rubbish, they looked like something from the 70s. Van Damme should be pleased that Derailed is no longer the worst movie ever, and what about the ending? he started to shine in blue, turned into a bright blue bubble, sucked his girlfriends and the movie ended. WHAT WAS THAT? THERE IS? when the movie was over, I hoped the DVD would spontaneously combine to save me from the pain. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> DO NOT THINK, OBEY, you'll thank me later.
