Although I still have to review the movie in about two years, I remember exactly what made my opinion as low as before. Having loved the original Little Mermaid, and having been obsessed by mermaids as a child, I decided to set aside time to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you do not have the original director and actors at hand ... you're just wanting your butt to be clipped. <br /> <br /> Following on, our story begins with a little older Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the team sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is great at numbers of singing and dancing, but in fact, that's what made Eric my favorite prince. He was calm, collected and a genuine gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did. DO NOT. Sing <br /> <br /> And then there's the villain. Oh, how could we forget the chills that ran through our spines whenever Ursula appeared on the screen, terrorizing Ariel and the audience around the world? Unfortunately, this gene was not passed on to his seemingly useless sister, Morgana. Nothing ever was, never said about Morgana in the first film; She just appears out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh how cute. The younger sister is angry and instead of going after the trident, decides to kidnap a one-month-old baby. I gagged. Besides being a plain character with no sense of originality in her, Morgana was very unorthodox. The same plan as his sister, the same lackeys (who, incidentally, did not scare anyone. I had a three-year-old child in my lap when I watched this movie, and she laughed hysterically). She had no purpose in being there. ; I wish I had seen Mother being the villain. I'm sure she would have done a better job than Little Miss Tish over there. <br /> <br /> King Triton had no respect what he gained from me in the first film, and he did not even get me started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a stern but loving father in the first film, and in the second, it is almost as if he had lost the will to beat fear in the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with their 'dingle-hopper' (yes, I admit; I called my fork from a dingle-hopper from time to time after that). In this movie, Scuttle is almost forgotten. A supporting character, even at first, he at least added something to the film. He was rich with a taste that the others did not have, and in sequence, they all took everything from him. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrisome as before. Disney, do not do that. Do not even try to play our favorite crab. Or our favorite fatty fish, who becomes a father and has a crowd of very annoying children. He's fat, and he's bland, and it looks like he's going straight to any second. <br /> <br /> The walrus and the penguin were unnecessary, and after a while, you begin to resent them all. Especially Melody, who has no depth to her. <br /> <br /> And one of these days, Disney, I'm kicking out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I had not loved your documents a lot.
