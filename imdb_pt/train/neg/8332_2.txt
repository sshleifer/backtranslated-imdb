Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, revolves around three "couples" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Very good start as far as I'm concerned. Interesting. Couples are divided into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a heterosexual being "harmlessly" pursued by a gay man. <br /> <br /> The "het" couple does not really have a big part in the movie. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing with each other, but they seem to have no real purpose, since they are so marginalized. My guess is that they represent a more everyday illustration of how sex / violence is integrated into a couple's life. The couple is not very aggressive and is not even filmed erotically. As characters, they do not add much to the theme or plot. <br /> <br /> The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay assaults, persuading a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley. This turns into violence. And violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence increases as the film progresses. The main problem I had is that violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem like any of the characters are in real danger. It just does not work. Since the whole theme of the film is about the relations of the characters with violence, this is a big problem. Unfortunately, makeup also does not help. Sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's too bad. In one scene, I actually wondered why one of the characters had red spots on his face. Confused. <br /> <br /> The most interesting pair of characters is the "couple of stalkers". Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent plot. Maybe it's because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution in the end. Shiner might very well have been better off if he'd gotten those two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted very much with this film. It's admirable. Most low budget movies do not suck a lot. I do not think Calson got what he wanted. I myself did not find anything particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was not convincing. This does not mean, however, that the director can not get something with his next film. <br /> <br /> He seems to have something to say.
