Well, this just maybe the worst movie ever, at least the worst movie I've ever seen. They have experienced these 666 children of Satan, the anti-Christ movies about 1000 times and none of them are good and this is perhaps the worst of them. They think it's going to be better movie the more they use this fake blood. This movie has no idea, actors and filming are terrible. I can not even understand the minimum of 10 lines in this movie. Really nothing to tell but it is awful. Because they can make films like this in their right mind, they can not understand it. This can not be a Hollywood movie, is it? Just do not go watch this use your money wiser.
