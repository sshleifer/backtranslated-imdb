Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who has been in a mental asylum for more than a decade after he was found wondering about the vicinal roads with blood on his hands. Doctors want to test a new experimental drug that will return their lost memories if it works. But when drugs give him hallucinations of a demon, he chooses to escape. While out he befriends a boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) mistreats his mother, does not leave her near the darkroom in his basement and acts suspicious in general. While the overall 'mystery' of the film is a little easy to identify before being revealed, I thought Mr. Diamond was acting enough to keep my attention all over. (In the interest of full disclosure, I have been a huge fan of him since Homicide and his brief but extremely important role in The Shield through Journeyman & Dollhouse). Not a great movie, not good, but useful enough. Although I liked it better than the previous films I saw from director / writer Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: A pair of fleeting breasts in a hallucination <br /> <br /> < > <br /> My Note: C-
