Remember the good old batman show of the '90s? The one people praised? The one that people of all ages could appreciate? The one who portrayed Batman as a real detective rather than the Hulk in a bat suit? The one with the villains you could relate to? The one who had villains with real motives? <br /> <br /> Well, Warner Bros does not. So it's true. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about batman? Have they ever seen a batman comic book? Do they know that Batman is a 'detective'? Joining 2 clues does not make you a detective! That makes you a slightly intelligent monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout for an episode: <br /> <br /> The penguin steals something. 'Opening Credits'. Batman finds a dead revelation of where he is. Batman goes there and gets in trouble. Commercial. Batman thinks it's obvious / stupid out of it. The penguin escapes. The penguin does something obvious again. Batman follows. They do kung-fu (by the way, and I mean everyone knows kung-fu for some reason). Batman Punch Penguin. it is deleted. Go to arkham. (Note: he's usually a different villain to every episode.) Well, as you may have noticed, Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the floor, maybe it's in the old amusement park!" Yeah, maybe he's been there the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I already mentioned this, but EVERYONE KNOWS KUNG-FU! EVEN PENGUIN! What are they thinking? (probably because of the people who made that animated series of Jackie Chan) <br /> <br /> What really bothers is that the show is just action. He has no intelligence. If Batman needs to think, he'll use the technology, then do some kung-fu. <br /> <br /> But, hey, let's not forget the villains. After all, what would Batman be without his Ladino gallery? <br /> <br /> Well, first, I have to say, praise for originality. I do not think that other Batman media would have envisioned the wildcard and a monkey man of braids, charade as an emo, and venomous ivy as a minor (which is kind of confusing when you think, it's not your sexuality meant being its main strength?) <br /> <br /> What's even more crap, though, is that, each character is now a stereotyped, two-dimensional bandit. <br /> <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham for no reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a power-hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason. <br /> <br /> The penguin just wants to steal everything. For no reason. <br /> <br /> Perceiving a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most insulting thing has to be Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy award? winner of the episode 'Heart of Ice' by Batman: The Animated Series? The one that gave Freeze reasons for his crimes? The episode that was so good that it was used in the comics about its original story (mad scientist)? The one who made him a victim, with a goal? Hell, even Batman & Robin acknowledged that using that as Mr. Freezes originated in that P.O.S. Well, this series says "F # ck this" and makes Mr. Freeze a jewel thief before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold. He then continues to steal jewelry for no reason while saying lines such as "Have an Ice Day". <br /> <br /> Maybe they've watched Batman & Robin after all. <br /> <br /> But Hey, look on the bright side. This series makes you feel nothing for the bad guys, which means you're a good person. Good for you.
