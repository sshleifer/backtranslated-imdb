Yes, the first "Howling" was a classic. A pretty good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly, but gained strength along the way to have a good ending, so the anchor turned into a cute werewolf just to be shot in the cameras. Yes, that made a fun horror movie right ... well, forget all that, since this movie has nothing to do with that movie. Oh, of course, they sort of find out that the anchorwoman is the same and that her brother or something is trying to figure out what and why things have fallen, but they range from the small, cozy retreat of the first Transylvania movie or into some place here where they must fight wicked magical werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie, however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before but still read the script before taking on a role. Maybe you could have gone into hell "An American werewolf in London" that might have been possible. He was raised in London after all. Heck, werewolves do not seem to figure much in this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death for me in this movie was when the girl started talking loudly and this guy's ear started to bleed.
