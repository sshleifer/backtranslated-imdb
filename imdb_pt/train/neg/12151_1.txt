this is possibly the worst performance I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what's with the cast. The protagonist of this film has some kind of disharmony of the nose and it is almost impossible to look for any period of time without getting fixed in your nose. you could go to your local supermarket on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 most qualified and beautiful women leaders. I made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a "cool" DVD case. This film seems to be just a lesson project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I'd rather have passed the time when this movie was watching public access television ... at least the special effects are better and the people there are more attractive than anyone you'll see in this movie
