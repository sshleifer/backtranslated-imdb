When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 80's and, like everyone who grew up at that time, saw all the teen movies and summer camps out there. So I could not wait to see this movie that totally imitates this movie genre. What a disappointment !! The movie was just a bunch of really bad jokes and jokes, almost without any plot and substance. And the attempts of the black-humor filmmakers failed altogether - some of these so-called jokes did not seem to be utterly cruel and offensive at all. The only good things about this movie were the wardrobe, the music and the acting. It was cool to take a nostalgic trip and see all the styles of summer clothes from the 80's, and the same goes for the music. And the acting was first-rate: almost all the best Hollywood comedians were present. Too bad they did not have better material to work with.
