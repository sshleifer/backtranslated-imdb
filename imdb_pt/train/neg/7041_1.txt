What else can you say about this movie except that it's just awful. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons to see this, but that's it, but their talents are wasted on this garbage. I think they used a double in Some of Adam's scenes, like when he's running because you can not see his face. If Adam was ashamed to be in Zombie Nightmare, just think what he must have felt in appearing in this ??? Whether it was before or after, I'm not sure, but even so, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (check out the first and last version of Mystery Science Theater 3000) in comparison to that. The class is very annoying and overdone by some. A rip-off of The Wild One, starring Marlon Brando, of course. Tina looks impressive. I hope she and Adam have a good pay !! Pass!
