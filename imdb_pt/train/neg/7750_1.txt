This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet, I like BARNEY more than this movie. The graphics suck, half the movie is animated, the killings are crap and, most of all, I was ready for the people who made this movie! PLEASE DO NOT ASK HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ATTENTION TO THIS MOVIE. The only good part was when the movie ended! This film has 50% Jurassic Park, 0.1% Sabretooth and 49.9% DUMB! Please do not waste your time watching this movie, you will be sorry. Do you want to know why this movie sucks? Well, the cap was sucked, the graphics sucked, the blood looked (I mean it) ketchup, people tried to blow themselves up, college students think all this and can resist the animal. I mean, there was a 5-foot tiger running straight for a woman, she throws a spear from 30 feet away! WAIT UNTIL YOU CAN TAKE IT! The acting was awful, too. Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie, and that just had to ruin it.
