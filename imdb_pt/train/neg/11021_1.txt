Hallam Foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some kind of Oedipus complex afterwards. <br /> <br /> It's something like 95 minutes long, but it would be better in ten. There is like an hour in the middle, where he is practicing climbing on roofs, and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo (only he is much less sympathetic). <br /> <br /> There's a strange love story involved that does not <br /> <br /> I have nothing to do with anything. She looks like his mother, yes and so? We know he misses his mother, that's what the first ten minutes were about. They should just put the beginning and the end together and it would have been a short film. Now it's a portrait of a character who does not change. He's a guy that things happen. The only active choice he has in the middle of the movie is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> There's this whole Oedepus thing going on, which supposedly makes us analyze your character. He paints his face, wears women's clothes, and wears a dead badger on his head. Write a review! You have to see the end! He returns to his house with the badger on his head (and is shot as a horror movie) to kill his father's new wife (with whom he had sex at the beginning). And somehow they thought that would not be fun enough, so they put indie punk music in the background. I have to admit that I'm allergic to movies that want to write a psychological complex in your nose. It seems that this director / guy MacKenzie / whatever he is trying to show us that he also studies psychology at school. You're so smart! Thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back to our memories! You really dug it! What Wallraff! Ok, now I realized that this movie is based on some random book, but anyway .. Photowise is annoying. Many talking heads. In addition, the editor has changed the scene colors to scene, you know cold and hot etc. because? maybe "Hallam Foe" is a resource and a test film for color blind people. Or maybe they just thought the drama would not be enough to tell us that he feels alone, so they raised the blue for us to really understand. <br /> <br /> I will not even comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute drawings they did in the presentation. And all the "fluffy" sexual things going on. This whole movie is an independent cliché. But I recommend it. I laughed more than a few times. Although it is really annoying to be a movie student and see how this crap goes through the machine.
