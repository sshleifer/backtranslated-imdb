I am the wife of a youth pastor and we took some young people to see this movie. We then spent an hour trying to explain it to them. They did not understand and I did not like it. It is based on a concept that has gone through all three major religions in the world (the Bible Code, the Torah Code and the Koran Code) and is so questionable that it can be laughable. This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who believe that we check our brains at the door.
