Ariauna Albright is a very good actress, but why she participated in this writing farce is a mystery. What could have been fun ends up as a classic boredom. The only thing about Ariauna is that she can act as good as looking sexy unlike her partner Lilith Stabs, who looks good, but it's obvious she spent the money to go to school at the spa or beautician. This was a production that called for some T & A and with an imaginative screenwriter could have achieved this in the flow of things. However Ariauna does what she can under the circumstances and to some extent regains her reputation. The Tempe company should be aware that when you wear two attractive women in fetish police uniforms, viewers will expect some fetish play & T & A. Nough said.
