I remember liking it a few years ago, but back to that, I wonder why. I think it always looks good and the girls do very well, but the men prefer to leave the side aside. Why, oh, in so many English films about sex, do we have to have such inept men alongside the pretty girls? What's more this starts predictably as a sexual farce similar to that of the Confessions films, but about a third of the way (as we are beginning to appreciate the presence of the lovely Me Me Lai) the movie asks us to start taking it seriously . Not only that, but the central rock club and the cannabis sequences are very stressed and seem just flushed. In short, this is not as innocently foolish or as cleverly serious as it seems. Richard O'Sullivan maybe, as such a central figure, could have helped, but I think this is one of his worst performances. Just worth it for the ladies.
