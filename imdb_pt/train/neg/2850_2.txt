If I had realized John Wayne was in that movie, I would not have watched it. It is humiliating to the Japanese, unfortunate to Hollywood and embarrassing to anyone who thinks. But most of John Wayne's films are like that. Hollywood in the fifties still believed everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and still is) a bit different. The film deals with the isolationism of the nineteenth century in Japan. Perhaps it is Hollywood that should be isolated. To put it as succinctly as possible, this film is a shocking and jingoistic cliche (kind of a Madama butterfly with bad music).
