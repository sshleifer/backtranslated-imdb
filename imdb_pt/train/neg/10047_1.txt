I've written reviews for several MoH episodes, and this is among the worst. An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned as the credits roll. If you look at people's things they would never do in real life, it amuses you ("let's check the basement!"), So this is your show. Except, it's not fun or fun - it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The extent of the virus is never shown. I can ignore the fact that this only affects men, because the resulting situation is very, very scary. But then things deteriorate when the daughter OBVIOUSLY leaves the disturbed father at home, and finally dies in his hands. The woman flees to the north and finds dozens of situations. So, some kind of spirit or alien or something appears and saves it (things that make you go away?). Or something. So she's snuggling into the heat. The end. <br /> <br /> Horrible. These directors are sending this
