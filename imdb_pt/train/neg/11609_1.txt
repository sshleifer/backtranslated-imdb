I'm not from America and I know what 'Wife Swap' is. When a show came out of that name, I was thrilled to see some of the show's glamourous sexual moments. But what I got was real stupidity. I was misinterpreted by the title title, has no adult content, no nudity, no even vulgar dialogues (the Hallmark channel launched the Hallmark channel and I think they edited / deleted that content to make it simple). <br /> <br /> A program that shows an image of the current state of the American / Western family, overweight chubby people, contaminated teens, and their familiar comings and goings. In each episode, two wives / two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each other's homes and change each other's family routine with their new rule. Sometimes the result is good or worse. In the final section, each mother is brought back with her husband and tries to complete what she has done with each family in the last days. It is the sucking part of the program where each candidate fights for their rights. I was sucked into seeing all this instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff. I mean, who does this program, more than who gave the name of "Swap Wife"; It's better to be called a "Mother Swap." After all, it corrupts all the great things that the real Swap Wife represents! <br /> <br /> Wife Swap = Average Suction Reality.
