As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and humiliating for single women over 40, not to mention all other women of any age. It was a sad and pathetic attempt for a man to write and direct a "girl movie," and failed miserably. Andy McDowell is not much of an actress to begin with, but given the nonexistent "plot" (I hate to even refer to this as a plot) in this, she did not stand a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy / empathy for any of the characters and no attempt to make the movie somehow realistic or believable. And then there's the obligatory male fantasy of an attractive heterosexual woman suddenly deciding to try lesbianism - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> I would not only like to get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What an imitation
