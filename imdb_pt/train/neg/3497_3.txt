Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this show does not praise her in any way. The character is not even remotely kind and it's not a situation where you think "oh she's so cool that I love her" just "she's such a fuck." This character is just a simple old self, just, b * tch.Sarah seems to have a hard time having to carry this show because she is the only fun medium in him. The humor, the dialogue is all so boring and dry it's like listening to your grandfather talks about the marbles you collected as a child. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman show is so incredibly boring that I was thinking of changing the channel to watch old replays of Married With Children. this is funny because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude". I'm sorry, but I do not find a show full of dry, mushy humor in the wall stories about the bitter and angry life of a bitter and angry loser. with her annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with a cool anywhere near to funny. I can not stand this show, although I usually think Sarah Silverman to be that "I love her because she's so ab * character tch "as in rock school, and most of it get up. I think this show is boring with characters who think being mean and saying and doing things for shock value, for example. the constant pube, diarrhea and $ hit in general for laughter. Sarah Silverman's show tries to be funny and fails, or needs a laughing track or better writers. Someone compared this to South Park, but it's not even close. opinions about Sarah Silverman and will not become an annoying troll, which means you will not see me being ab * tch and constantly posting things like "This show sucks" and "Why is not this canceled yet? ". like the Sarah Silverman show, if you like.
