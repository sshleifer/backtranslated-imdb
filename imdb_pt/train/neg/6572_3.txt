In my opinion, the title of this movie should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". I went to a screening of this movie a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the result. Although I appreciate that the director made a film about the 442nd men - a subject long deserved to be approached in the film industry - acting in some parts of the film was quite obsolete. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were great. However, the director should never have positioned himself as the main character of the film. Sorry Lane, you're not just a movie star. Stick to what you are good at in theater. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this movie was also horrible. She should never have taken on a speaking role and her appearance was unfit to play the role of a Miss Nisei queen. There were other young actresses in the movie who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were not they cast for that role? Another major problem with this film was its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers do not seem to be fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone. Granted this was a low budget feature, but since this was a movie based on war, is not it important to show some really struggling? This movie was a worthy attempt, but definitely not worth a large distribution.
