This movie was two and a quarter hours excruciating. Someone please tell me what was the point? <br /> <br /> I mean, I understand the historical setting. It's supposed to be about a disorganized group of Confederate bushwhackers (terrorists?) On the Missouri-Kansas border, revenging all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the US Civil War. But beyond gratuitous violence, there was not much sense in this movie. Maybe it was a political statement? Is this war really nothing more than gratuitous violence? If that was the point, it was well done, but I do not think that's the point. I think the producers really thought they were making an interesting film here, but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot. It seemed like I was watching a paperback romance come to life, with the characters looking like what you'd see on the covers of such novels. <br /> <br /> This film should be recorded along with some of the towns of this gang. rang!
