I rented and watched this movie for the first time on DVD without reading any comments about it. So after 15 minutes watching, I noticed something is wrong with this movie; it's terrible! I mean, in the trailers it looked scary and serious! I think Eli Roth thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be funny ... (So stupid, it's funny ...? WRONG!) He must watch and learn from the best horror comedies such as "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return of the Living Dead"! Those are funny! <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is the reason I registered on www.IMDb.com to be able to release my thoughts of discontent about it. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the movie a second time> AAARGH! and take notes for my partial "review" to show how foolish the film is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, Where's My Car?" (comedy) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy! But that ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can a script and a director be? That bad. Here are the horrible scenes in chronological order: In the first scenes we see Henry, who does not realize that his dog is lying on the floor with his tongue hanging out of his mouth and the glazed look is dead! <br /> <br /> The film does not explain anything about the long-haired blonde boy who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered question ("What's wrong with the forest?") is "nothing." The script has that bearded face warning them about the forest just for "suspense." <br /> <br /> So the "smarter" 5-pack, Bert, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire. He finds Henry, now infected, who begs for help, and from here, the film wants to break the record of using the word "F". Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks very sick. Bert: "Do not make me shoot you!" (he forgets to add: "... with my BB gun!") <br /> <br /> Bert goes back to the hut, but what about this? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex, but now they suddenly decide to go for a walk! Marcy wisely takes away the unprotected bonfire that Bert had started earlier. (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert does not mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he killed him with his airgun. <br /> <br /> Later, when the Five Stupids sit around the campfire, another weirdo appears with his dog. (Maybe that's what the warning about the forest is all about ... is it full of weirdos ... and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them just because he has a large bag full of cannabis. (Their brains are completely intoxicated! No wonder they are so DUMB!) This is the last time we will see this forgettable character ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry appears in his cabin, (NOTE: He was lying all the time a few feet from his hut !!!) looking worse, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But the young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. He enters his unlocked truck that, of course, also has his key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to get Hell out of there, but instead he starts vomiting blood all over the panel, benches and windows. The Fantastic Five rush out, armed with: a cannon of compressed air, a knife, a baseball bat (* eh? Have you tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods ???), a poker and a spray (insecticide?) Can, ready to fight the single man, unarmed and terribly ill. (smart script!) Bert manages to kill the car with a single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. "What else should I do?" Bert shouts at his defense. Jeff and Paul try to overthrow Henry with his bat and poker but lose and knock on the windows of the truck. Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say, "He's coming our way!" (Thanks for the info, ass broads, I can see that! But I do not think he wants to hurt you!) Marcy sprays in his eyes, causing Henry to scream! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with burned firewood, which they left recklessly burning while they were inside the cabin! (Where did all this wisdom go? I think cannabis started charging its price! :-) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away, screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day, Bert and Jeff headed out for a mechanic. And Marcy decides to "ask for help" alone in the woods while Paul stays with Karen ... Does not that sound stupid? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already "asking for help". <br /> <br /> I skip my comments now as we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE paddling over a huge, winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she's going? Anyway, she goes to the river bank and finds a very large, apparently abandoned cabin and, like most horror movies, she walks into the booth saying, "Hello? Is anyone there?" Suddenly, Bert appears behind a piece of furniture and scares her (and I at first). And along comes Jeff, too. How did they get here !? They swam across the river ??? Do you see how the script is without brains? <br /> <br /> Vice Winston meets Paul in the cabin. He somehow does not notice the blood in his truck. This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I decided to stop torturing myself further and took out the DVD. (Before I cast my own eyes! ... Now, this is funny!) <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, do yourself a favor and watch "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys "or" The Return of the Living Dead. " Then you'll find they're more fun than this ... thing. Even Toxic Avenger part 2, which is also a bad movie, is a lot funnier than "Cabin Fever".
