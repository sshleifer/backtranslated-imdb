Dissapointing action movie with an interesting premise: a young Mafia slayer (Chandler) must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for service, so he goes to California to take some lessons with a well-known professional assassin (Beluschi) . First and most important task: kill a young girl (Lee) who is completely strange to all of them. But is she an easy target? The movie goes on and on based on this main idea, but the result is just a bad routine; even the strange twist in the end does not save the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give this to 4 (four).
