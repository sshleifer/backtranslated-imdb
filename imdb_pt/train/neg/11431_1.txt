It is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any "gray matter" will agree that this film simply does not work. <br /> <br /> The problems are in the direction, cast selections and lack of depth in character building. The comedy word was very difficult to say when I expect to laugh when these words are used. Let's look at the problems in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister, both in their 30s, seem to be well adjusted. They find a complete stranger in a park and the character Heather Graham walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half-healthy people would be running to the other side or at least yelling at a police officer. He then walks awkwardly and makes some stupid statements and she falls in love with him. So, after a date everyone goes out together, he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Vegas in a week ???? Hello, does anyone still feel stupid? He goes out with thousands of women and he knows this person who says about 10 words we see on the screen and he wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, it just did not make sense. Of course it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe I could, but the direction made it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now Heather falls in love with her too and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very shallow character) kiss or more to the point where it was the most sloppy kiss that chemistry can be there. I found it non-romantic and bland and while many say that Heather can not act, I think the reality is that Heather was clearly the wrong person for that role. <br /> <br /> This was the debut of Sue Kramer as director and for me it was too much for her to chew on. It would take a lot of crafts to make this movie work and IMHO could be done with better writers, cast and direction.
