If you are a fan of the Mystery Science Theater 3K, Giant Leech Attack, or Pinata Survival Island, this movie may be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and I did not even know the existence of this movie until the day before its release when the advertising company panicked and covered Music Row with dozens of leaflets and billboards. It hardly lasted two weeks in theaters. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, poor writing, and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a movie. For starters, the names are a little too much: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> Toby slow delivery of lines makes a wonder that production assistant got stuck holding the signage cards off the camera. Angel's character travels quickly from her town to a cowgirl, slipping into the southern slang after two days on the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Toby - actually, in the final scene, her clothes are identical, making someone wonder if the wardrobe assistant called her sick. <br /> <br /> The audio is inconsistent - perhaps the most noticeable example is when Toby decides to take a plunge and his voice sounds like he's screaming in a gym. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development to suffice what happens on the screen. Outbursts, exasperation, grimaces and bad mood best describe the actors' interpretation and direction of the terrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie is most appreciated after consuming a couple of alcoholic drinks and in the company of his best friends. But that's not saying much.
