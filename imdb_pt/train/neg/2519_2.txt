Actually, I paid to see this movie in the movies. <br /> <br /> I would get a grade of 1, but the fight scenes between the robots are fine, and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize that some movies have larger budgets than others. I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies are likely to suffer more on a small budget for obvious reasons. But, one of the ways this film fails is that almost every piece in each set looked cheesy and cheap. I mean, could not they even make it look good? <br /> <br /> The other great reason for this movie being horrible is acting. If I watched the movie now and knew what to expect, I might just enjoy the cheese factor, but at the time I was expecting a good movie and had no idea how horrible it would end up being. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience ended in only 85 minutes.
