When his in-laws are cruelly murdered by a gang of thugs, a young man is ordered to escort his mute friend, forced to take rap for the gang, to Tucson for trial and end up having to face the real killers along the way. Decoy is a real-life gimmick sent to video rental companies to lure you into better movies! It is very talkative, illogical, slow and boring. <br /> <br /> There are good costumes, scenery and photographs, but nothing is better about this vanity project of writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink, who apparently had a lot of money on hand. <br /> <br /> They used to do westerns like that, less than an hour in length. Trim this to about half the length and you may have something watchable.
