The original classic of exploration, while far from being enjoyable on almost every level, concerns some guys who turn cats into human flesh by eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people being redone with added scifi elements . Cats can not get enough, and when contaminated food is consumed, cats attack their owners. Misplaced on almost all levels this is an example of the absolute background of the barrel stuff that used to play cinemas in the early 1970s updated with alien cat and dog racing fighting for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is a hack, but he is such a nice person (I usually like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and comment strips) that you can pretty much excuse the junk he just left. Mikels wanted to make movies and he did not care about the outcome, as long as he produced something. More power for him, but I wish he did not submit us to his home movies
