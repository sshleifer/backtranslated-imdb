When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it was a horror movie. Apparently, it was not. I have no idea how this movie was allowed to appear on this site. FearNet is a site that features scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful of all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The film begins with a man with a parchment with a signature stamped on it. It breaks the seal and certain disasters happen. Water turns to blood, oceans fade, moon turns red, etc. <br /> <br /> The female character was also annoying. Many of the things she did made no sense. Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date. Coincidentally, it's the date when she should give birth to her baby and she starts to freak out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what that means. The two worst things that happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to kill his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul to him. Here is what happens. The mentally retarded person is shot and killed and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore enters a hospital in the middle of an earthquake and gives birth to her son. She touches the head of her son, transferring her soul to the child and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly have a change of heart? He gets furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man, so it's all about forgiveness, since a lonely woman transfers her soul to her baby? <br /> <br /> * End of the Spoiler * The movie is pretty stupid. It is another religious end of world propaganda. The acting of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is excellent. That's all there is. <br /> <br /> I give this film 2 stars of 10. Good acting with a lot of nonsense!
