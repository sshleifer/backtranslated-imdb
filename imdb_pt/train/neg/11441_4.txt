After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside, you are very convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. So the movie changes for the worse. <br /> <br /> The warm feeling may still be there, but as others have said: The plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it is almost unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> The movie is fast paced, and you get the impression that it is moving fast, or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut many scenes Realism is not a goal for themselves but as a spectator, I am quite convinced that this comedy is not intentionally unrealistic, happens to be. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this movie has some cool interiors, and despite the bad script, I think the actors' performances are good. If I could only evaluate the first 25 minutes, I'd probably have eight. As it is now, it's a four. ... And that's cool! <br /> <br /> If you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyway. If not, I recommend you watch the other thing.
