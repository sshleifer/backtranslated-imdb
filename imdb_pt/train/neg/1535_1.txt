I do not think you can get much worse than that. Join bad actors, fake members and three stupid stories and what do you get? This nonsensical excuse of B-rate for a movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the poor quality of the video and the acting is just pathetic, especially when you bring the 25 year old girl posing as a grandmother with the film. usually bread grandmother over little ears. Besides, the man is fine, but the woman is pretty ugly. "You look great!" NOT! The werewolf in this was the best of all three I would say, but still not impressive, since it was all a bad fantasy. The woman's face later was decent enough for Halloween, but not for a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you pass, the worse it gets. There are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded, it's ridiculous. The whole "I want to be a werewolf too" "How could you do this to me?" It was silly to say. You asked me to get over it now! The werewolf will not even be spoken ... it's a rat! <br /> <br /> The third one has no meaning ... almost forty-five minutes of monotonous boring narration make up this story and the whole thing of the switch has not yet made it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, badly ... I did not even hear some parts, it was stupid. The effects of the animals were either rat or pig, which was stupid. Could not they use lion sounds? I do not think so, good movies use that. Well, if you like B rates, this is good for you. I have this movie since I'm a hardcore werewolf fan and I'm going to buy any werewolf movie and watch it more than once, but that's just me. If you prefer good, do not waste your money. I beg you!
