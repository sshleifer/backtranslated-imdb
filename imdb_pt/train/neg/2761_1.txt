Everyone does things that they later regret. Things they wish they could blame for drugs or alien possession. Things that although they seem rational at the time, are later revealed as invitations taped for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity. <br /> <br /> For some people is signing the note for the new Hummer, for others is choosing a homicidal ride, for others is still sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously in need of money. <br /> <br /> For me, it was a movie. D-War Dragon Wars In hindsight, I should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would come from its stuttering and repetitive title. But with my voluntary suspension of unbelief and a naive faith stemming from the cool poster in the lobby, I really wanted this movie to work. Unfortunately, by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the whole background story, fifteen minutes later, I had the sudden revelation that comes from knowing every point in the plot of a movie not yet seen. And worse: I knew exactly how much each point would suck. <br /> <br /> Let me be perfectly clear here, the English language does not have enough nuance and depth in the field of definitive evil to correctly describe how bad this movie really is. <br /> <br /> As for knowing all the plot twists, I was wrong. In the spirit of the old Godzilla movies, whose scales this one is not worth filling, conveniently generated extra subplots each time the main characters were threatened by the spectrum of meaningful dialogue. <br /> <br /> infested with shrill cries, miraculous escapes, and concentrated deposits of ill-explained anguish. <br /> <br /> This movie is what would happen if you gave Power Rangers products access to the national defense budget. And a lot of alcohol. <br /> <br /> Let me try to explain. Imagine you can catch all the action-movie action scenarios of the last decade: First grab the amphibian army that talks Star Wars Episode One tracks and remove Prozac from them until they're ready to play at Navy Seals. <br /> <br /> Next, see the approaches of Kira Knightly and Tom Cruise. call him Ethan as a "subtle" nod to the Mission Impossible franchise.) and give them a lot of narration film noir so that no one gets confused while trying to follow the depths of the pool of their thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally, add a hoarse voice villain in a pointed Lord of the Rings yardage and a pair of giant snakes, angry at having their scenes deleted from the last edition of King Kong, and put all of them out in no particular order on modern day Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Now hurry to the pharmacy to find something for your sudden migraine. When you come back, purify these ingredients until any sign of originality is dissolved in a homogeneous mass of cheese and serve semi-gelatinous. <br /> <br /> At various points during this photo, I found myself saying out loud "Make the bad movie stop", and start crying. <br /> <br /> Calling this B movie would be an undeserved promotion. After summer school, and lots of physical therapy, you can go through a C-level movie if you could somehow spend most of your time. <br /> <br /> In short, if you find yourself with money and brain cells to burn, and the need to punish yourselves for heinous and unspoken sins against humanity, Dragon Wars may just be the movie for you.
