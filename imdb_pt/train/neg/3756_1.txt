It really is that bad of a movie. My friend rented it because he, well, is an idiot. But again, I must be an idiot too, because I watched the whole thing! The actors were on the same level as the high school theater geeks who think they are going places. The only place they will go is to return to Luby's waiting tables. All I could think of while watching this "gem" was how it really was made. I mean, some "screenwriter" thought this premise was new, original, and profitable. So some idiot with money believed so much in the script that he decided to spend some money on the naive misconception that he would make a comeback on it. Actors were scaled up, locations were explored, makeup artists were hired, computer animators fresh out of Al Collins's graphic design school were brought in and this shit began to take shape. Obviously there were a ton of artists. things I hated about this movement, but the only thing that drove me the craziest was the overuse of music. Every minute of that movie was marked. There was not a single pause in the song. And sometimes it was mixed louder than the dialogue, not that it made you miss some vital point of the plot or anything. <br /> <br /> After it was over, we decided to watch Mystic River. It was like driving a VW Diesel Rabbit from 1980 and then switching to a BMW 740il. You could not have two more opposing movies in terms of quality.
