I just rented this today .... I heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a pile of smoking poop this movie is !! Does anyone know the director's address so I can get my five dollars back? Finally, someone hit "Stop-loss" in the first place of "Worst Iraq War Ever Movie". To be fair, I do not think there are Iraq war movies anyway, but that was really bad. <br /> <br /> I will not go into any technical inaccuracies, there are hundreds of reviews from other GWOT veterinarians detailing all of them. If the director would bother to consult even the lowest E-nothing on technical accuracy, they could have made the film a little realistic ... maybe. I think the writer should get the "credit" for this waste of a movie. He or she obviously devised the plot for this film from some vivid imagination, not afflicted by the constraints of reality. Anyone but me want to know what the purpose of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I am very amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is difficult to watch as a veterinarian because of all the flagrant inaccuracies, but even if you can ignore it, the plot is a drug, the characters are superficial (to say the least) and the acting is bad at best . It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie should be about Explosive Decisions, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
