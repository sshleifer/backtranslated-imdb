William Shatner in small doses is tolerable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation, and moderately entertaining, it was considered appropriate to broaden his role and exaggerate. Just like in the original Star Trek series. I think I'll never understand the American mood, which often goes over the message to get the message across. I vote with my feet. I do not watch the show anymore, which is a shame because the rest of the cast was good. It's a shame that Shatner's overstated role also affects James Spader's performance. But most demonstrate how society is going, I guess. I do not travel the same routes. Frank
