The misleading cover, title, and small hidden copy of Power of Prayer trick me into renting this movie. <br /> <br /> It started very well and attracted me. I really liked. Between 1/3 and 3/4, the film began throwing things that were not created and did not make sense. My first thought was, "This is not written by someone who can tell a story." I ended up watching scenes from the movie, thinking that I had missed something. <br /> <br /> When I arrived in the last 1/5 of the movie, it was all a boring and humiliating dialogue that did not make sense, did not say anything and was annoying to hear; I turned the sound off and made a quick advance to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch out for DVDs labeled as Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions <br /> <br /> And I'm a practicing Catholic.
