"It's not like that great mechanical toy," says one character at the beginning, commenting on "Jaws." Well, "Blood Surf" would just like to have a beast as compelling as the "Jaws" shark. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are terrible. Acting and driving are not much better either; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a chewing gum commercial than to a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but also for the audience. Saying that you "like" this film only encourages the filmmakers to offer us more of this crap, further destroying the poor horror genre. (* 1/2)
