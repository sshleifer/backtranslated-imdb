The film had good acting moments and good times (albeit of course a very low budget), but a poor rating due to the basic premise being underdeveloped. The main point of conflict between the two leaders does not develop in a realistic way. There are some scenes in which they disagree over this, but no deep discussion that explains how they can get together while they see the world so differently, especially since Glenn's job is so over in this part of his life. (and Adam is active enough with him to support him with time and money.) In addition, several times Glenn is portrayed negatively by being the way he is (apologizing for Adam for his past) while Adam is shown as being honest and "traditional". "I watched a discussion session with the director after seeing the LTR, and he said that he presented this conflict between them because if he was in Glenn's place (and he said that in real life it relates to Glenn's opinion) that he could never date anyone with the visions of Adam.Well then, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do this in the film.In addition, the director said that he directed this, his first movie, only after reading (Directing to the Laity.) Directing was not so bad, but far from being a prime effort. I've seen worse things, but I rarely leave the movies feeling frustrated.
