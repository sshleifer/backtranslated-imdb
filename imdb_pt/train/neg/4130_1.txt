One of the top contenders for the worst movie ever. The character of Joanna Pakula seems to have an I.Q. of 3, which is only one less than the writer and director. The script would not have gone through a high school essay class; the "jokes" are juveniles; the tacky concept. These artists were obviously desperate for work. I stayed until the end just to see if it would get worse. That happened. Life is too short to spend any part of it watching this movie.
