<br /> <br /> Once I ignored some of the implausibilities, this was actually a pretty decent horror / monster movie. So I'll give you some of the good points first: - the dragon was pretty convincing, especially when she went through the tunnels looking for lunch (hint: she likes humans). - the action was reasonably uninterrupted and, after a weak start, I became quite absorbed in the plot. "I'm sorry to say, I kinda cheered for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie. Now for the implausible things ** maybe a few spoilers **: - If you were hunting a fire-breathing dragon in AD 1100, you would carry it into your cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm ? Duh. - a female character with an all American name, blond hair and obvious Slavic accent, trying to pretend she's Spanish? There is? - a leading scientist whose Slavic accent can cut you with a knife, and he supposedly was born in Chicago, educated in the USA? - a military helicopter pilot who makes his own repairs, pilots a huge transport helicopter without any other crew, and is an expert sniper and combat soldier? IT'S OK. Uh huh. I will not even mention that he gave 3 different signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. <br /> <br /> It's still better than some of the Japanese monster movies of the 60s, but not much. If we're lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although the end has left that possibility open. Or maybe they'll hire a real director next time. <br /> <br /> After all, I gave this movie a 4 out of 10. Add another 2 if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain get eaten in the first ten minutes. smile
