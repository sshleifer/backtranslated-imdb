I think it's time for John Rambo to move on with his life and try to put Vietnam back. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a soldier, but a cold-blooded killer. Whenever it appears on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly, I'm tired of Hollywood making it look like it was. This is not the worst of the films about Vietnam, this honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo carrying a 50 cal machine gun to face what appears to be half of the Vietcong army and many Russians is an insult to be observed. What's worse is the Rambos cheese speech at the end ... Please !! Oh yeah, I heard they're doing another ...
