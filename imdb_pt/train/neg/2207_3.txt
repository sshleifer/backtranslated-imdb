Hammerhead is a combination of the genres of the movie mad scientist and shark killer. In a little cast type, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human / hammerhead shark creature. Strangely, this being is, in fact, his son, whom he transformed into this monster to prevent him from dying of cancer. Or something like this. <br /> <br /> A group of associates is invited to the scientist's private island. They end up being used as a shark bait or shark companion. For some unknown reason, the IT boss was brought in as part of that team. Who knows why? Luckily, he turns out to be a Ramboesco hero full of features, though slightly overweight. I'm working on the assumption that he learned to deal with an assault rifle as part of his daily job working on first line support. A normal day for this IT man, presumably, involves fixing someone's network connection, followed by a call to overthrow armed wrongdoers. Or maybe a call to fix someone's PC has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with ground-based human-shark hybrids? Anyway, he's awesome and saves the day. Come to the girl. <br /> <br /> The shark man is a somewhat lame creation, but, I suppose, judging by the overall effects in this film. And the film follows at a decent pace. It's full hokum of course but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land killer fish then you really do not have anyone to blame besides yourself. As it is, there are guns, blood, girls and possibly even a helicopter exploding. It's rubbish, but not as bad as some might say.
