I'm afraid I have to disagree with the majority. I found the latest Spike Lee a bit boring! Although he was trying something different, that is, not just documenting the rise and fall of serial killer, I do not think it worked very well. <br /> <br /> There really is a bit too much going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's relationship (Mira Sorvino), Ritchie's lifestyle (Adrien Brody) and then the local mafia types. The story is good, but in the end it's all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, could not Mr. Lee put more on the side of the film? > <br /> <br /> There are some good points. All the scenes with 'Son of Sam' killer, David Berkowitz, look very nice (color saturation, etc ...) and the acting is very good. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt that the different stories would work well. on their own or without the deaths. It just was not strong enough in the end. <br /> <br />
