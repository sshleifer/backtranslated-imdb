Wow, it's ironic, since the movie was gone for a while, I think someone reviewed it a few days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched this movie simply because it has Nick Stahl for the record. The film was ridiculous. The characters made me crazy, they were so clich√©d and stereotyped. This movie had some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. There were many twists as well. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the movie that is worth seeing, however, the scene: "Hot Heart, Cold Gun" where Nick Stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower. (Well, actually they were all detestable.) But their acting in that scene was excellent. The look on his face reminded me of American Psycho (a good movie). It's worth seeing the scene, but it's not worth seeing the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and do not watch.
