I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating when I checked the IMDb after seeing it. This is actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I have seen many bad movies. It sounds like a good movie at first, but when he goes into surgery I can not believe how bad it got. This voice destroys EVERYTHING! Imagine that you are being opened like this and then listen to what he says. I saw the film in German, so I do not really know what he said in English, but ironic things like "Yeah, it does not hurt ..."? ... what is it? Saying yourself "think of something else" and then forgetting your pain just thinking about your girlfriend is just ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell does she imagine something like that? Someone comes to tell her, her son died in surgery (which she kind of had to wait for). Besides, she found some letters in Jessica Albas's purse. more than "she knows the hospital" ... and then it takes "a second" to find out? What the hell? ^^ And the end ... why the police catch them? The patient died in surgery, that's all that happened. That drunken doctor also does not know anything else ... and then they end up with them, even with the girlfriend ??? Because??? Despite all that I think Christensen did a bad job, but that does not really count for me ... the mistakes and the stupid things I wrote above are the problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we were all very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I just do not watch;)
