I can not believe NONE of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two rather disturbing scenes of sexual assault. It is as if our culture accepts this type of behavior as simply sexual, but not violent. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these attacks - as in, the woman who is repeatedly beaten and pressured never blames men for their actions, nor anyone else. A man is prevented from completing the attack when someone throws a dagger at him, but he is reprimanded only with "you can not force a woman to love you" instead of "you should never force a woman sexually, you idiot" .. from a woman's point of view, the film is a disappointment. It's a kind of 'throwing a bone' at women by letting them be fighters and skilled leaders, but the film is much more defined by the novel - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power, with men dominating the woman they love. This incredible martial arts fighter does not use any of his fighting skills to try to fend off his attackers. It never makes them apologize - on the contrary, it seems apologetic. Overall a depressing and disturbing film with great cinematography and some cool fighting scenes, but not as good as Hero for a long shot.
