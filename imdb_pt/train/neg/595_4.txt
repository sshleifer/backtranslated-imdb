Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some pretty graphic scenes and ... well, yes, it's all about this movie. <br /> <br /> No real plot, no plot. No friendly character, well, 'characters' is not correct, considering that you have no idea who you really are. I mean, they're being chased by something weird in the sewers (who is this thing?), Why is it there?), That's pretty scary, I guess, but do I really care? No, I do not know. Why not? Because I have no idea who these people are and I do not know if I want them to die or die. It is one-dimensional and depends on blood and sound effects to scare you, which rarely happens. <br /> <br /> This movie has no meaning, no purpose. It seems I fell asleep and missed the 45 minutes of buildup. He jumps straight into action. Basically, some women and their friends get stuck on the London subway, they are being chased by a weird creature, so they eventually escape from it. <br /> <br /> Creep has its moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is great and the sounds are OK, but that's not what makes a decent horror movie, so sadly all of it goes To the garbage. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new. Another predictable and modern 'horror' where Kate (the protagonist) consistently does the stupid "hey, I know you a lot at home, I think I should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! I'm going to do the complete opposite because I'm a stupid blonde thing ". I wish they would not do it, this is done many times, it's boring and predictable. In fact, I'm very upset that the silly woman was not stabbed by the gray, alien looking creature. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" is the slogan of the movies. Well, Creeps' trip ends only a little in the movie. If you drank a few beers, you took a couple of friends back to yours, so sure, watch by all means. But if you want something original and smart, avoid it.
