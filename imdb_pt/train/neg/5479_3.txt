I bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary expedition of recognition to Mexico before facing the Aztecs. How good he did, because he would never have known about the T Rexs who inhabited a particular valley, where the locals revered them as gods. <br /> <br /> That was understandable. What was not was the blue-eyed Ian Ziering release as Cortes. Even with the blonde hair that became famous in Beverly Hills 90210 dyed black, Ian looked positively ridiculous. At least he made no attempt to accent Spanish. The true hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also at the end of a television series with a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of Dallas. PD. He finds true love with an Aztec princess, and life would be perfect if it were not for those damn prehistoric beasts the natives love. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus Azteca seems to have used some outtakes from the famous Sid & Marty Krofft series. the land of the lost. All that was needed was for some Sleestak to appear. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in discovering this reconnaissance expedition that did not make the history books check the Tyrannosaurus Azteca. So try and sit down with a serious face.
