We bought this movie from a store called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration, since we previously bought the movie No Big Deal and re-made it. <br /> <br /> We hoped this movie would be very inspiring so we could redo it and put it in the tube. However, this was shocking. BORING is the main word that comes to mind. The bad effects and script are not enough to make you watch. The main woman's body seems to be shaken at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested. However, that only makes you wonder, did they blow the budget by getting her to take off her clothes? If so, I would have asked for a refund! It looks like a home movie, the shots do not even match each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our bad movie remakes look professional. I CAN NOT believe that this is being sold as a marketable product. <br /> <br /> IT IS JUST BORING and UGLY watching. The actors are bad and there is no professionalism about it. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
