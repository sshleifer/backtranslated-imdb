I rented because the second segment traumatized me as a child. I went downstairs early one morning, started watching HBO, and The Raft (segment 2) terrified me well. This time, I still liked The Raft, though I could not tell if it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was really a good short. The other two segments were complete rubbish. I can not believe a producer paid somewhere to make this crap. All I got from watching this was to ruin one more memory of childhood. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of contaminated childhood classics. 4/10
