It occurs to me that some of the films that were banned during film history were actually very important and very good films. I would argue that instead of banning challenging and controversial films, censors should consider banning such bad films as posing a threat to their IQ and their sanity. If they did this, one of the first films to be quickly hidden would undoubtedly be "Stroker Ace". This movie is horrible with a capital 'A'. It's the worst movie that Burt Reynolds has ever starred in ... a great feat for a man with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop and Middle" and "Rent-A-Cop" on his resume! <br /> <br /> The fine story describes us the successful stock car driver Stroker Ace (Reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. He gets stuck in a derogatory contract with corrupt promoter Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants, like dressing like a giant chicken. Launched in the mix are Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's friend, and Pembrooke Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo with a weakly smaller brain than a pea that is courted by Ace. Hal Needham, the director of this low-quality junk, was a former stuntman and made several films that were based on his expertise in performing spectacular maneuvers and pursuits / car races. Some of these movies were OK, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace" he reaches a career low point. The characters are so stupid that you really feel sorry for the actors who interpret them. Anderson is especially overloaded with such a stupid role that makes you grit your teeth in despair. Humor is weak and childish throughout, and stunts and racing sequences are not remarkable. Even the out-takes during the final credits (which can be found in all Reynolds-Needham collaborations) are generally bland, which gives the impression that the film may not have been a lot of fun to do. "Stroker Ace" is a stinker of considerable magnitude.
