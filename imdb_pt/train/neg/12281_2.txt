Hearing such praise over this game, I decided to watch it when I tripped on the cable. I do not see how this "eludes" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the topic at hand. I think if you have an interest in stories about private parts of women and how it affects their lives then this is for you. Otherwise it is quite annoying and annoying. If anything, I found it a little degrading. <br /> <br /> I asked a friend who also saw this and she thought it was awful too. So it's not just a guy who "does not understand."
