Somewhere, there must be a list of all the worst movies of all time. One of them has overlong camera photos of the stars sitting and looking thoughtfully into space, or where they focus unbearably long on kitten kats eating spaghetti. This picture of the seasickness is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and are trapped in caves and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then finish and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then leaves and there are a lot of fast forward and rewind and there are long thoughtful shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's a kind of technique of making movies or maybe the film is so bad that they have to fill up with long and wasted shots, because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story, the movie would take about 14 minutes . Do not get me wrong, this is about the 30th gay movie I've watched in the last 6 months and some of them (most of them) have been very wordy, predictable and boring, but this is a terrible waste of the best so far was "Beautiful Thing ". So I saw this and after the first opening shot I stayed and thought "Oh, no, it will be creative sinny mah" But I gave it a chance and watched it and then when it turned out I threw the DVD in the trash Sorry I did not like it and if you did, sorry if I offended you.
