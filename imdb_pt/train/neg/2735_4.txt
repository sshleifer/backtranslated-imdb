I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've ever seen (though my partner gave me a handkerchief in anticipation of Brendan Fraser's moment ... * sigh *). It was good to see Cox out of the incessantly fragile "Coxism State" he is today, if only briefly. I also enjoyed trying to put the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in the case of JD) and the youth of the early episodes. Can I also see how Zach might be well on the way to a Chevy Chase or is it Matthew Perry? chemical sliding induced by falling of prat (already recognized in Conan). A small side note, the music (now stuck in my head) from the caretaker-induced dance set was Martin Sexton's "Diner."
