I started watching this movie with great expectations. However, after an hour I gave up on this movie, because it only instilled many unanswered questions about me. This has already started in the opening sequence and only got worse. <br /> <br /> Why would they bury Hollander under a statue? Why is there an Italian comedian present? Why did the farmer's wife save Hollander? Why did not he, when he was saved, flee to save his life, instead of making love to the farmer's wife? Why did the farmers not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer would not be around? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian comedian know of the Hollanders' gold? Why did he hide in the pit in the middle of the estate of evil farmers? These and many other questions arose, and none of them seemed to be answered in an acceptable manner. So I guess I'm totally missing the point of this movie, and I'm not connecting with the story in any way ....
