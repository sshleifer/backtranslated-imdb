Pretty good movie, but not a true story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorius liar, a murder and was never considered innocent. The State of New Jersey simply did not accept it for the third time, since 20 years have passed. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Take a lie test and get free." He did not accept. This movie should never have been made, but the money talks. Many people spend their lives in prison unjustly and, no doubt, more black than white. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Jens
