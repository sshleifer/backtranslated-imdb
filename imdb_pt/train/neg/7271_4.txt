This could have been Gone With The Wind's homosexual counterpart given his epic duration, but instead he was content to be a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing happens. The characters are one-dimensional and have no other development in history (actually there is no story) than looking for each other and kissing. It is a pity that an interesting aesthetic proposal, like having almost no dialogue, is completely wasted on a film, than not striving to examine the psychology of its characters with some dignity and achieve true emotional resonance. In addition, it purports to be an "art" movie using the worst naive cliches of film snobbery. But anyway, if anyone can identify with your great banality, I think it's okay.
