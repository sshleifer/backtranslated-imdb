This movie should have been only 10 minutes. I mean, there's only 10 minutes of watchable content on that thing (I even hesitate to call it the movie). The movie's opening credits were somehow promising. As the movie begins with brief comments from the man himself, you actually rub your hands and watch for more scenes from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a decent job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. The duration of Cave's performance leaves you even more eager to see more of Cohen whose wit and well-spoken words have pleased you. But as it turns out, Cave's performance is just the beginning of long and super tedious performances, literally, of a bunch of people who do not even have a minimal attraction to keep him in their place. I mean, what does the filmmaker really think? five-minute close-up of I want to be singers at a fake show in Australia !!! What the filmmaker really thinks of insulting the public, adding "false applause" to these unpleasant and endless performances. The film is a perfect torture that shows very little of what you came to see. There is not a single footage of Cohen's past. In fact, with the exception of some photographs of his early days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add up all the minutes that Cohen talks about, it may not get to 10 minutes. But those 10 minutes are tortuously presented between disastrous camera jobs that capture some of the most uninteresting people who shout Cohen's lyrics. If you've already decided to waste your money on this movie, DO NOT! just throw it in the trash and at least spare your time.
