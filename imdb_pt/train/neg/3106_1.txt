Whenever I make a list of the worst movies I've ever seen, this movie is always there. It has no redemptive qualities. It took an act of will to sit down with the whole thing, and I'd rather shed my own blood than having to sit down again. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with that? Let me tell you the story of my trip to see in the movies. <br /> <br /> I went to a midnight show on a Saturday night. I alone in the theater were myself, and a bunch of noisy, loud, uncontrollable teenagers sitting somewhere behind me. They were obviously having fun on a Saturday night and had come to this "comedy" for a few laughs. Before the movie started, during the previews, they were laughing, making jokes and making noisy comments. It was boring borderline; If they had continued their unbridled enthusiasm in the film, I might have said something, but I was feeling tolerant and empathic with their amusement, so let it pass. And they calmed down as soon as the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge this alleged "comedy" by the effect it had not only on myself, but on this rowdy group. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film's showing, not a single person in the theater laughed. Not once. Not me, not the rowdy kids. Absolute silence, beyond the soundtrack. And when the movie was over and the lights came on, we all, all of us, slowly stepped out of the theater into a slow, somber, absolute silence. It could have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> That was the effect that this "comedy" produced. Not laughter, not pleasure, but absolute DEPRESSION. It was a depressing and depressing movie, not a little funny. Preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I think Mel Brooks' "Blazing Saddles" are on the short list of Funniest Movie Ever. It still surprises me that the same gentleman could be responsible for the probably less funny movie of all. <br /> <br /> In short: if you are feeling very happy, take a spin on this movie; otherwise, do not say I did not warn you.
