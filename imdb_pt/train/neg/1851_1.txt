A "friend", clearly no taste or class, suggested that I take a look at Ron Atkins' work. If this is representative of his work, I never want to see any more of it. It's amateur, self-indulgent, bad-quality, self-indulgent. The title's "prostitute hunter" is an angry low budget filmmaker who kills a lot of prostitutes. There is a bit of nudity and some erections, but no element could save him from the hangman's snare. The lighting is frightening, the dialogue is childish and mostly shouted, and the direction is without notion. I saw a dock on American exploration filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those presented. He spoke as if there was something important about his work, but after seeing this, I see nothing of any importance. There is also no style, and the terrible video effects (like solarization) only add to amateurism. Not so bad is fun. Avoid.
