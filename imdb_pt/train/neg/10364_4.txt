The book is so good that at least the opening of this movie made for TV will move it but then as it diverges more and more from the book, taking away all religion and love and math and putting on cliches of cotton candy, it becomes annoying. Still, from the comments I've heard, people who have not read the book tend to like it, and if that even drives the child to read A Wrinkle in Time, it will have served its purpose. The most embarrassing change is to make Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert (I love to Laugh). Nothing is as indecisive as on-screen characters laughing hilariously with things that are totally bland.
