This movie looked good in the beginning, but it was never perfect for your expectations. The director is talented and has good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of Asian directors), but does not know how to create or tell a good story to accompany him. The story was fragmented and seemed to spread through all sorts of directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explicable and interesting angle. Basically, the film never fits the explanation of press releases. The acting was very good, however. All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was excellent as it always is. It's a shame he chose to make such a weak movie.
