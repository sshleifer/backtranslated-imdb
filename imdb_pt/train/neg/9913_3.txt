This is one of those cheap TV movies where the characters seem to lose all sense. The premise of the story, the kidnapping of a son by the boy's father, is very good. But history seems to beg for belief. Whenever the mother is advised to do nothing, you know full well that she will do this. It is a little improbable and does not deserve a vision.
