It has a very bad acting. Bad story lines. Bad characters. You should never see this show if you see it. TURN IT OFF. Or you'll be cowering for the next 30 minutes. It should never have been displayed. Not great. You should never see it. NEVER EVER. So now, if you want to watch this show, please do not. Turn to THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place, or Nick for Drake & Josh, these are much better family shows. So believe me, I've watched it before. and it's honestly, and I honestly say, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of TV. So do me a favor and never watch this show.
