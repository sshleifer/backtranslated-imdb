This movie was the most beatliest Mormon movie ever made. This made RM & Sounds Provo look like well made movies! It was supposed to be funny of what they told me. The best part was the best actor in the movie Travis Eberhard - if he had not been in the movie, it probably would not have been made! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It was not funny 9. It was beaten 8. Had Thurl Big T Bailey, character who made no sense 7. He was made in Provo 6. He did not make fun of Brokeback 5. He had Larry H. Miller in 4. It was Clint Howard's first movie was not funny in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a return 2. They must have released in Surreal Life 1 auditions. It was made by Halestorm Entertainment !!
