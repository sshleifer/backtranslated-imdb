When it comes to horror movies, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, ignore substandard production figures and ignore the holes of interest in the interest of a good scare. This movie simply does not have any good scares to offer. It can not even be appreciated as a camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad direction, deaths were predictable and poorly staged, music was annoying, camera work was poor, even the clothes were bad. I felt very bad about the actors, who were obviously trying, but who had to deal with a terrible and artificial dialogue and an obvious lack of direction. I doubt they have any rehearsals either. It's embarrassing to watch, and so tedious than getting to the end "artificial" surprise requires tremendous resistance. It's easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I do not usually write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, do not miss the "Making of" presentation. The writer / director seems to have the impression that making the killer a woman was a bold and daring move. (Seen it.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this movie as if it were a new era "Citizen Kane." It's like listening to a group of third graders take you behind the scenes of your Christmas parade. They really think they have created something of substance. It's sad, really? The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for true atrocities such as "Hands: Hands of Fate" and "Space Espionage". So "American Nightmare" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I have to say it's somewhere in the mid fifties.
