"Die Sieger" was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in Germany. I watched it last night and I must admit that I am deeply disappointed. If this is supposed to be "the last best hope" for fun and challenging German action movies, well, then there is not much else. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" tries to be sexy, bold and furious, but it's nothing like that. The characters are wooden and stereotyped and whenever they do something unexpected (which does not happen much) the act against their nature. This makes it difficult - for me almost impossible - to follow them or even identify with them. <br /> <br /> Above all, I think the film is a very bad cast. There is not a character I believe in. Maybe the senior SWAT officer - but that's all. Those people who try to look or act like special units like elite cops - I do not believe them. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. But I think it's said badly. You do not know the bad guy - for example. And when, after a "very somber" show, Karl Simon (the good guy) asks the already dead opponent "why? ... for what?" I wondered the same question, knowing, that Dominik Graf would not have the answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better, even with action films.
