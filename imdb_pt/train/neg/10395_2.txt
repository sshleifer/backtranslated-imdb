What the producers of this shocking adaptation were trying to do is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> A group of high-quality actors, in the main cast well (with some notable exceptions), give very good results. performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally as good as Joanna Lumley as Diana. Everyone gets along with the scripts they have received. <br /> <br /> So much for good. The mean would include the sets. Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although strangely the house they use for House Dower looks a lot like her. Of course, then, House Dower is too big. In the later parts, the writers decided to bring the whole story back to the UK, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination I have no doubt that they could have recreated the Ceylon. <br /> <br /> Now, for evil. The script This is such an awfully bad adaptation that it's hard to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the battle of Britain, but survives, blind. He makes a brief appearance and commits suicide - why? Loveday has changed from Gus's totally in love with a sensible farmer woman who can give up the love of her life with only one tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus, a passionate and passionately passionate man, is prepared to abandon his love without complaining. Walter (Mudge in the book) passes from a superficial infidel husband to a devoted family man. Jess is transformed into a psychologically disturbed young woman who does not speak. Aunt Biddy still has a drinking problem, but now without any justification. The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who is afraid of armed soldiers. While Miss Mortimer's breasts are absolutely delicious, I could not see how their display on several occasions changed the plot forward. The Nettlebed, deliciously named, becomes the mundane Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing with the list. <br /> <br /> There is a sequel (which I lost all interest in seeing this absurd) and would like to know if the changes were made to create the following story. It is difficult to imagine that Rosamunde Pilcher would have endorsed this grotesque perversion of his book; presumably, it lost control when rights were acquired.
