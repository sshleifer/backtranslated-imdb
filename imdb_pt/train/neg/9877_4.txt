Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on Roald Dahl's classic book. Wes Anderson directs and respects the small book of the same name onto the big screen in an entire film. While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man, the movie seemed to have gotten lost in his own clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind, knowing he is a talented man, and if this was a bad movie, it would be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day at the movies, so I'll let it come out easy. I admit that you have good intelligence and spirit, and the animation is good, but the film gets progressively harder to get in, leaving the story behind and making random scenes of random things going on. The characters are good too. Jason Schwartzman expresses the clever son of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), Ash, and especially engaging. The film does not reach a level of terribility, but it certainly comes closer and closer as it progresses. I'm sure Wes Anderson will be back on the rails with another amazing movie when and where he decides to make another movie, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment.
