I agree with everything people have said about it, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst I've heard all my life! There are real vocals during the times when you should be listening to the actors talk! And the vocals are like a broad version of Danzig singing: "The darkness of the forest! Oh the darkness of the dark and dark forest!" or something so harmless. The singer has a terrible vibrato and was recorded with a treble microphone over some sections of synthesized strings and fake beats. It's horrible !! <br /> <br /> Yes, the male leaders are terrible. So are the women. This is a bad case of gender stereotypes - it's so bad! Everything they say revolves around being a man or a woman, just throwing stereotypes to the max. Makes me sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> The children were so nervous in their lines that you could not understand them. And why do ghost kids always wear small loops in their hair, beautiful blue dresses and long hair? And ghost boys always wear clean pants with bright, cute blond hair? It's not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Dad's face was very defect-free and clean to be that of a man who lived in a cave. Nice beard and fringe, pa. Did you perfectly cut those with a knife or went to town and went to the salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
