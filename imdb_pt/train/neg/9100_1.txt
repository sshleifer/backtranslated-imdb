Christ, oh Christ ... One watches stunned, incredulous, and possibly unbalanced, as this exercise of bad taste in obscenity without joy unfolds with all the wit and dexterity of a paralyzed Galapagos tortoise. Can such things be? Does this movie really exist or was I the unwitting guinea pig of some dark international drug company, drinking my coffee without knowing that it had been contaminated with a dangerous hallucinogen? I have seen many movies and many bad movies, but nothing prepared me for it; At the end of it, I was sinking, breaking the carpet with my teeth like a dog, scratching the walls, howling until my lungs were sore. I begged desperately, frantically for mercy (for whom this appeal was made, I do not know), and I longed for the desire for Ozu Yasujiro's balm. Sweet Crying Jesus, the memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I am most vulnerable, at least I can deal with them. I shiver, I collapse in tears, I bite my nails until my hands are full of blood, but I can not banish the terrible flashbacks of my mind. I'm haunted. I'm spoiled I'm a man's shell. The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having gone through this terrifying experience, which can mean just one of two things: a) the movie does, in fact, exist, or b ) I am only a victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite incomprehensible is that some people seem to have enjoyed their ordeal, or at least not been left traumatized by it. Maybe they're part of the operation. God damn them, the maniacs! God damn them all to hell !!!!!!
