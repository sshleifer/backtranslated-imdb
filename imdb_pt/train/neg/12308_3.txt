Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this movie from putting an egg the size of an emu. Based on the classic TV series Phil Silvers, he bombed because: A) was updated to the 90s, and B) The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing, weak and silly script. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovely characters making simple but hilarious jokes. Expanding this premise in a 90s movie was asking for trouble, and it shows. No one could pay me enough to go through that stench a second time.
