The Omega Code was a model of cinematic inconsistency. There was a little (but very little) good performance, especially by the two prophets and Rostenberg, who only appeared once and had no lines. Otherwise, the performance was decidedly poor. The plot was rather weak, and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretations. Certainly not one of the best of the year.
