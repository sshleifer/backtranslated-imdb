This was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot did not make much sense and the acting was horrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress, I can not imagine why she decided to make this movie. Her character, Piper, is drunk for most of the film, except for the opening scene. On the plus side, there were several points in the movie where acting was so bad that I really laughed out loud. But despite that, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes long, but it's 80 minutes of your life that you'll have completely lost.
