This time the hero of the first movie has become human and this time uses fist and foot combinations against super-universal soldiers and a computer that went wrong and is prepared to dominate the world. I'm sure it was the Double Team, who convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme had no more credibility in providing watchable action movies. However, this is what has tarnished his credibility forever. As a Universal Soldier: The Return is not as monotonous as the Double Team or The Quest, it's still pretty awful without the style and style of the original pairing. This sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling. When I look back, not even the action sequences were so exciting and therefore this film is a useless failure. In other words, another clunker on the Van Damme assembly line. <br /> <br /> * of 4 (Bad)
