It is difficult to know where this adaptation begins to go wrong, because I think the problem begins with the books themselves. Alexander McCall Smith has discovered that you read them not by the detective stories, but by his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an Africa that does not exist. He did to Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan - not so successfully but based on facts. Once I realized that, I stopped annoying that Jill Scott, an American singer / actress, is Cast as Mma Ramotswe. If it represents a land that is not Africa, how appropriate is it to be a black woman who is not African? She is not the only American in the cast; Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose. Both women are very young for the roles they are playing and very glamorous. They both brutally murder local accents, and both focus so completely on brutality that they do not offer much in terms of acting. Scott's Mma Ramotswe is bouncy, cute and soft. Mma Makutsi, by Rose, is an annoying motor mouth slut. <br /> <br /> The result is almost impossible to see. The main cast is rescued only by the presence of Lucian Msamati, who performs a decent performance as Mr. JLB Matekoni. It comes out smarter and more intense than in the books, but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for it - it is a bright light in an ocean of suction. The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly placed at the feet of any commission of butchers who wrote the script. <br /> <br /> For me, McCall Smith's writing has always been a lot of fun, albeit notoriously bad. He refuses to be edited. As a result, his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific and characters that change their name in the middle of the sentence. It is, therefore, a kind of achievement that the team of copywriters on this project has really worsened. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is now largely anglicised. The characters speak of "openness" and "sensitivity to needs". Mma Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni openly flirt. Mma Makutsi complains about not having a computer, but due to her constantly refurbished hair, make-up and jewelry, I'm surprised she does not have a MacBook in her purse along with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> So, what are we leaving here? It's hard to get upset about this bad adaptation, because honestly, most of the things I like about the original books are apocryphal anyway. McCall Smith paints a fictitious Botswana, populated by cute and non-threatening black people, full of fun and palatable nuggets of wisdom. He reads well despite linguistic farce, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wants black people to be. It just is not true. <br /> <br /> Given that, it is not surprising that this program is as bad as that. It remains to be seen whether the European and American public will notice, however.
