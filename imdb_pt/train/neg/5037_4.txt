Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, she's fifteen and her birthday is coming in a week. As Melissa is beautiful, all the boys in the city want to be with her, but the few who can catch her interest die mysteriously. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason I wanted to watch this movie is because Dana Kimmel from Friday The 13th pt 3 was in it, which is not a good reason to run away and watch film. When I started watching it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a good slasher, it's really boring and boring and it just is not going anywhere. After more than an hour, only three murders occurred and the story did not develop at all. <br /> <br /> The film is well filmed with good photography and good direction, but as with many other slasher. movies from the 80's, the movie suffers from being very dark at times. The acting is really very good and Melissa's character is easy to sympathize with, even if she's a complete bitch. The plot is not completely stupid but it's too annoying to keep you interested, the only things that kept me interested were Melissa, she was gorgeous and Dana Kimmel who was really sweet and cute in that movie . <br /> <br /> In the midst of a really annoying slasher movie that is not going anywhere, I definitely do not recommend it to Slasher fans.
