Wow, that sucks. I'll summarize as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> A score invites 4 naive whores back to their castle. A lot of nothing happens a long time ago. Lame soft-core and non-erotic sex scenes happen. Some girls have their heads cut off (off the screen) - The End. <br /> <br /> The only things for this movie are decent costumes and costumes, some bad voiceovers that lead to an unintentionally funny dialogue, and some brief nudie shots. And believe me, these things are not enough to rescue the 90 minutes of boredom that this movie is. In fact, the best part is the tacked up early distributor who introduces some slutty goth cubs covered in blood and showing off their boobs and again - this is definitely not worth the admission price for this crap. As everyone has noted - the title of the film is completely meaningless - since there is absolutely no blood sucking, no dancing of any kind in the film. It may well have been called "The Kidnapper Leads the Jerk Circle" - and at least would have a better title that also does not belong to anything in the movie. A precise title would have been "90 minutes of torture" - another attractive title that would have been at least true ... for the viewer. Honestly, the trailer on the disc shows all the best parts (and I use the term 'best' extremely loosely ...), so I suggest you watch it if you're still curious. I can not imagine anyone liking this wreck of a movie - please accept my advice and leave this on the shelf. 2/10
