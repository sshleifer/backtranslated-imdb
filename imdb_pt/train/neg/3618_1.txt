Full story of clich√©s about an impending divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a child of 6 years. A superficial dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a sub-plot of red herring zombies and, worst of all, absolutely no emotional or dramatic result. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else teach creative writing? The true sign of a weak storyteller - when you can not create any sort of satisfying ending - ends the story. I am compelled to ask, "What made you think that this was a story worth telling first?" <br /> <br /> Good, but wasted, debuts by actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, forgettable. And they wonder why no one watches indie movies! It's ninety minutes of my life that I will never come back.
