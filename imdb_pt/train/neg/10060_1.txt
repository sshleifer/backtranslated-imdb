The author goes on a "journey of discovery" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the "Bright and Deservedly Forgotten" movie is about his ancestor. It's not true, and he actually discovers nothing of a slight interest in this utterly silly and self-indulgent home movie, suitable for display at drunk (director's) family meetings, but certainly not for commercial - or even non-commercial . A good reminder of why most independent films are not chosen by the big studios - because they are boring, irrelevant, and of no interest to anyone but the director and his immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
