I could not believe it! Phrases cut? Good suffering! Know what? All true! Do real people always talk like that? Do not think like that. Good girl! Write a review! Raise your upper lip! Only reason given film 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such dish. Film as a whole ridiculous, unless you enjoy watching endless biplane duels. It seemed endless, anyway. Think of all the dialogues on the Franchot Tone. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British, they appear as Irish. Helpful hint - we Brits cut words, not phrases. And somehow we managed to draaaaaaaawl at the same time. But that's only if we were in a really good public school (ie, private to you).
