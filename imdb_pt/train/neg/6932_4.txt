I waited a long time to see the TORTURE DUNGEON from DR TARR and after I watched it, I was very disappointed with that. It's not the baroque movie I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a DVD Something Weird) is much better than the entire movie, which is notably forgettable. There is hardly any prominent scene and the appearance is interesting, but it does not even come close to other films of baroque style, of Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are monotonous and there is almost nothing dramatic going on, although we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with TORTURE DUNGEON from DR TARR was the fact that it was a conversation. More than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence, humor or something, instead we see / hear the main characters talking incessantly about bland things. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
