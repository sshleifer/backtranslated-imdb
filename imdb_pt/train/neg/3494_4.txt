Considering its popularity, I found this film a major disappointment. Maybe I was expecting a lot from this movie. After all, it's one of the best-known martial arts films of the '70s, but I've never been able to figure out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very interesting film with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the film was that the story does not offer a character I could cheer, since the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative. I know this should not be high quality art, but I found the movie boring. It's definitely not the best example of this much-loved genre. Your cult status escapes me. I recommend you skip this.
