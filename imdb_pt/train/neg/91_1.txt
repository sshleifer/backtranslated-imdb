I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I do not think I've ever finished. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a 1970s flashback and in the flashback there was a man with polo shirt, Oakley sunglasses and a new SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I can not remember). I do not understand how they could have said it in the 70's. He could have a cell phone too, I can not remember, it was awful. I went back to the store and asked why they still take the movie and if I could have the time of my life back. Even today it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some very bad ones.
