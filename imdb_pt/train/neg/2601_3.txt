I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch how I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of his first movies. The film is about a girl (played by the handsome young Drew Barrymore), who moves from New York to Los Angeles to overcome her recent troublesome loss. Shortly after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin = doppelganger, who haunts her. <br /> <br /> The film is very poor and bad. Both the dialogues and the acting make the film not worth seeing. In short, it's just something for Drew Barrymore fans.
