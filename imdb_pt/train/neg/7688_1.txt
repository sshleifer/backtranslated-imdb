Terrible movie made on a budget of about $ 9.99. Very obvious miniature sets used, bad acting and a horrible plot about aliens who use meat discarded from a butcher's shop as fuel for their spacecraft. The film contains a bit of blood (not enough to disturb) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands. (Yes, you read that correctly.) <br /> <br /> A saving grace was a song performed on the "talent show" (how's that for irony?) For a punk / new wave band that I think which was called "I am a missile looking for heat". Also, this is not worth your time, not even on a "so bad is good" level. Watch if you like cheesy extraterrestrial movies, but anyone else should stay away. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
