What the critics and the MST3K left out is the best part (and only a memorable scene) of this otherwise horrible movie: There is a very good scene of rape in the shower committed by the villain (Ben Gazzara) in Mary mentioned, later killed by the ineptitude of TJ). Perhaps rape is a very strong word, "mating ritual in prison" may be more appropriate. The backdrop behind this chance, but the forced encounter is the mafioso who is hiding "Ben Gazzara", introduces him to the girls in the pool. The 30-bait blonde dissolves him, but our villain must be pretty in love with her, because dating is happening at that moment. Her first step is to try to drown her, until her mafia, don benefactor, orders him to stop it. Kind of like the school girl you did not like but still wanted to have a carnal knowledge anyway ... Let's just say he catches up with her in the cottage later.
