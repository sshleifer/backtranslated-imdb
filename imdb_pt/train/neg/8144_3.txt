I just saw this at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2006. The synopsis of the festival guide looked very good, so we decided to check this out. I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Besides being poorly written, it was annoying. I will not take the actors because there is not much they can do with this bad script. <br /> <br /> The first bite was clich√© without being ironic, above seriousness without being funny. The film would have been better if Hunt Hoe had had an exaggerated sense of horror. Instead, he took it seriously and this resulted in a boring movie. I can not recommend this movie. It seemed very long and, in the whole, simply weak.
