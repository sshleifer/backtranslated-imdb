It seems that anyone can make a movie nowadays. It's as if all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, a script and a little money and walla you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation, and often this kind of low-budget film ends up being a failure. The shelves of video stores are full of so-called movies. These are not even guilty pleasures, they are just a waste of celluloid that is best forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for making trash films, but most of its films are gold for movies. However, some of the films they released had nothing to do with it and some, like 'Nightmare Weekend', did not deserve any form of release. <br /> <br /> Pros: The cast members do the best they can with the bad stuff. Some unintentional joy. Moves at a good pace (must at 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Cons: Horrible writing, which includes putrid dialogues and countless gaps. Badly lit, especially the night scenes and the end, which you can not understand. It does not make any sense. Badly marked. Cheap and very old-fashioned effects. Total lack of character development and you will not care about anyone. This is supposed to be a horror movie, but it's missing in that area and it's not at all scary. Nothing exciting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: I never expected this to be a forgotten jewel, but I never imagined it would be that bad. I do not know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a definite contender. Troma should have let this movie rot instead of releasing it. Do not make the same mistake as me and let your curiosity get the better of you. My rating: 1/5
