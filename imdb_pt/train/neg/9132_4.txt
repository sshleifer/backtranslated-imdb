Dr. Fu Manchu's diabolical plot, starring Peter Sellers in a parody of the characters created by Sax Rohmer, is an injustice at the end of Sellers' career. The plot was very simplistic and, if done correctly, could have been treated well, but, on the contrary, poorly executed. Part of the reason this movie was not so good was poor dialogue, cheap laughs, unsteady direction, and a weird feeling that the movie was a bit incomplete. <br /> <br /> Performance, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed image. I found the picture of brilliantly made diabolical Manchu Sellers, with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused about which one is the man who says "Oh, you all look the same to me." I hate to admit it, but I laughed out loud at that phrase. So of course a handful of strong characters caught the attention of people like Helen Mirren as the cop behind, David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery (his last movie too, is not a way to ending a career), and Sid Ceasar (who does a somewhat capricious performance from Al Capone's relative who works for the FBI). These characters also kept me watching. <br /> <br /> The sets were cool, too. Oriental designs and English society in 1933 were elegantly portrayed in this film. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, my advice is for you to watch the movie if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid. Ceasar fan. Otherwise, you'd better decide to chew aluminum foil.
