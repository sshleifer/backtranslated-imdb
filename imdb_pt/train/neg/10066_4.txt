Recently I watched this again and there is another version that is shorter in 1999. I have the impression that they are the same movie but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese and no short pikachu is all I can come up with. Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was quite annoying. She sounded as if she were almost asleep, expressionless with the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> That was quite nice, but there was not much to do. <br /> <br /> A collector (who after Lugia, he has no plans to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes much destruction. <br /> <br /> The following pokemon movies are a bit better, deoxys (poke 7) is great without. 8 almost here.
