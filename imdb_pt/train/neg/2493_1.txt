A truly terrible movie. I did not know initially that this was a Kiwi effort - but soon I began to realize that all the characters were speaking with kiwi accents hardly disguised under the false Americans. Why did this need to be set in America anyway? - could have been set in New Zealand and then the actors could have used their normal voices. Surely someone on the production team could hear the terrible attempts to speak in American accents? A bad bad movie. It surprises me that it lasted so long - how did it come out of the can? It looked like a very bad attempt on a Segal / Willis action-man movie. A TOTAL TRASH OF MONEY! If there was some TAXPYER money in this piece of junk, I would be leading a revolution to have all the money returned to the Treasury. I'm still staggering (catch it? Pun!) In the absolute rubbish I just saw. Why did I keep watching? Well, I'm a movie buff and I can not help myself!
