It was a good story, but not very well told. I liked the themes and the main story, which was not as clear as it could have been. Maybe there was a lot going on and a lack of ability to master everything. The performance was good for tacky, some were stronger than others and even the strongest actors had their moments of poor acting. It took me a few months to get through the whole movie because it did not keep my attention and the flow was bad. I just watched and I'm glad I made the movie finally move and have some continuity in the end. Again, a good story, but the delivery was sub insignificant. Would recommend for the story line and maybe a little eye drop, and I mean a little.
