I will not add to the plot revisions, it's not very good. <br /> <br /> Unlikely Orphanage in Bala. <br /> <br /> Cushing and Lee at their peak. <br /> <br> A little nice scenery. Good for spotting, and I quote, "Look at your mouth, that's Cassie of Fools and Horses." <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a poor example of the British film industry. <br /> <br /> Fulton MacKay was much better at Fraggle Rock, Keith Barron was better at anything else and Diana Dors did what he did best. <br /> <br /> Redemption appeal? He was free to watch on the Horror channel before his signature. I will not be signing up for this effort.
