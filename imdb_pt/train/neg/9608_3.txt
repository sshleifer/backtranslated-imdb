Dude, what the hell were the people who made this movie? And more importantly, where can I get some? The opening scene defines the tone of the film: a woman squirming naked in a circle of fire, turning into a werewolf. And that's not a transformation of Rick Baker's 'American werewolf', folks. We're talking about the worst makeup ever captured in the movie here. I can only imagine a bit of Italian glue spreading on the naked Annik Borel (who plays Daniela, the protagonist of the movie (is it a word?)), And asking her to roll on her skin. That's how bad it is. <br /> <br /> From now on, it does not get much better. Minutes are wasted when the scene munching on male actors about Daniela and her condition or something (I do not remember, but the dialogue is so bad if you do not laugh at it, you'll cry). <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that Daniela is not even a werewolf, she's a psychopath who gets mental whenever there's a man around (understandable, how she was raped as a child) so she thinks she becomes a werewolf as his ancestor (the opening scene). She can not help but tear the throat of every man she meets and just wants to be loved! Things start to look at Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a stunt double that does not trigger her episodes. Check out the assembly here, one of the most cheesy you've ever seen (laughing and hugging after diving headfirst into a window). <br /> <br /> Daniela's luck does not last as the film takes a brutal course, she is suddenly beaten and raped by a group of bandits who kill the stuntman. Reminiscent of "I spat on her grave," Daniela extracts bloody revenge on her rapists. <br /> <br /> That's 100 minutes of my life I will never go back. But hey, this is the game you play when you're a movie geek.
