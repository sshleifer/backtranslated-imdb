Did I see a worse movie? Maybe just "Hands: The Hands of Fate" has dragged more than "Dukes". I had more fun poking through the gigantic holes the movie gave me at any moment. Let's play some ... <br /> <br /> There was a remarkable script of death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the dukes and they do not respond.

Nothing I have not seen in the TV series. <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is upset with Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually hid it (albeit roughly).

Should bad jokes be captivating? I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen. She really felt like one of the best actors in the movie. This is telling you how horrible this movie is. She is a goddess.
