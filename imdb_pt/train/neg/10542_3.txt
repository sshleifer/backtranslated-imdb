Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), whom the extraordinary Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him capture, was resurrected with The First Power (given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber) and possesses the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess (.. who has an understanding of what they are facing), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die in their bloody hands. They will seek the help of Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who attempted to inform her superiors at the Catholic Church of The First Power but was denied access to a weapon that could stop Channing ... a cross with a blade that can penetrate into the heart of Channing ridding the world of its evil. She's going to take him anyway and give Russell a hand, and she'll need all the help she can get when Channing kidnaps Tess by preparing her for some kind of satanic ritual / ceremony. In the movie Mykelti Williamson, always a welcome supporting actor, gets the role of Russell's partner ... so you know what's going to happen to him. As in such films, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he tries to kill Channing, he is merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses. <br /> <br /> Pure hidden trash..stupid from the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give it to them, but in a movie like this they have no chance. Kober, who is usually always always efficient as the heavy one, is really nothing more than a silly villain who jumps into the air and throws rotten jokes.
