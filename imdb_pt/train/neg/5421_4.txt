This is one of the topics that I can relate to a little more than most people as I hate the noise and have no idea how those in the big cities, especially in New York as people can sleep at all! It surprises me that people bear all the noise out there nowadays. The basic plot of the movie is that it makes an interesting topic. It's a pity that's about it. Tim Robbbins is decent, although with the exception of a few scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel looking at Margarita Leiveva) he does not seem to really be there. My biggest hope for this movie is that the casting agents will see the absolutely stunning and talented actress to boot, Margarita Levieva. She does not have much to do, but she is a beautiful supermodel. Even when they're trying to make her look at another girl next door. It makes me sad that there may be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world without redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I did not care much about this movie because the script is not very good, but I'm happy to see some new talent. I hope producers and directors think of Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in a big budget movie. If they can make Megan Fox a star (come on she's not as hot, and her acting talent is worse than made for the Disney Channel TV shows) from a movie, it should happen easily for her, as she is beautiful and has talent! I recommend that she change her last name so that we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. Here's hoping it will make her career, and if there is any justice, she may appear in a great summer movie or two in the next few years.
