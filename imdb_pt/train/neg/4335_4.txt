The film and acting are not bad and Jay Hernandez does a good job playing Calito Brigante, but the movie forgets that it's supposed to be a prequel to a hit movie. The creators of this prequel clearly did not watch the original Carlito's Way or at least did not care about continuity. This movie is a prequel, which means that the original movie has already traced some history to us and this movie must end where the original begins or at least take it to him. None of Carlito's old friends from the original makes an appearance in this movie, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie, but he plays a completely different character. The original occurs in 1975 and the prequel occurs in 1969-70. Since this movie happens less than 5 years ago, do not you think one of Carlito's long-time friends would make an appearance? In the original, Carlito begins to be released from prison after spending five years in prison. This is only a few months between the end of the prequel and the beginning of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito spent 5 years in prison, so when the prequel gives us this happy ending to Hollywood is an insult to the intelligence of the original fans. What happened to Gail? It's the lack of continuity that made this movie go straight to the video release.
