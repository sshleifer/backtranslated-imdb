The worst movie of David Lean. Even 'what we serve' was not as bad as that. Usually, a movie with a really good reputation like this, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it can be considered a classic. But after watching this I just could not understand why this piece of crap was much appreciated in 1945! I did not like the English mannerisms, the story, the script (which may be witty at times, but totally bland) and the soundtrack. The character Elvira is meant to be attractive and attractive, but it was actually ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Just another movie that convinced me not to trust the reputation of a movie. Another "British classic" overrated.
