I despise horror movies, this is no secret. No plot, bad acting and blood gals are basic to these movie mistakes, and this "movie" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually do this garbage. (This particular junk was released directly to the video, as I recall). How to mention any other film would be a big insult to this other movie, I say this: All Phantasm movies, all Jason movies, Freddy movies, Chucky movies and most of Michael Myers films can be summarized in one word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
