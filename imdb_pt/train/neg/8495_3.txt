I am the kind of person who went to the local library and read books on Babbage's difference mechanism while my school friends were playing soccer etc. So if there is something like a target audience for this movie, then I think it would probably be included in that. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just need to watch it again. One previous reviewer mentioned not watching this movie while tired. Maybe that was my mistake. <br /> <br /> I tried my best to enjoy this movie, and there are aspects of it that I like, but overall I found it amateurish and quite laborious. Being a computer nerd I confess, I simply can not help but catch the exact time the movie was actually made, and how the graphics employed reflect that time (ie 1997). Having played games of the time c.f. "Mind Grind" to cite one example, this movie can not escape this low-resolution 16-bit color explosion of low resolution of that era. Now, fortunately this has declined somewhat in recent years in the gaming world, at least in favor of the actual game. <br /> <br /> Having to resort to watching this movie through a German FTA satellite channel (as I don 'I think it has already aired on the UK FTA TV as well, not recently of any way), I was slightly amused to see the final credit note. Gottdog (dog of God) had 4 people working on his design. It might be grumpy of me to have fun with it, since ten years have passed since the film was made, however, the end result makes the 80's movie footage look good by comparison. <br /> <br /> But as for the main story, I agree that the format is not the best idea. Like others, I agree that Ada deserves a movie without the angle of science fiction, and a more direct biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to cover the life story of this remarkable lady. <br /> <br /> There are fundamental mistakes that undermine my pleasure of this movie. First, the underlying idea that somehow real-world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some kind of extrapolation through intelligent software-based agents seems rather absurd. <br /> <br /> Film that a computing device can actually predict the mechanics of all things over time (eg the winds) is now known not to be the case. <br /> <br /> OK, so the Victorians may have held this view, but the works of GÃ¶del of the twentieth century proving that no mathematical system can be complete, Turing's works on the limits of computability, not to mention the chaos theory and quantum mechanics have completely undermined these ideas, which seem central to how the modern researcher must work the software. <br /> <br /> Finally, the click of the mouse in the air to mean "programming" is also simply wrong, as mentioned earlier. <br /> <br /> This movie might have been OK, but at least some technical Scientific Inquiry would have given the movie some much-needed credit in credibility bets. <br /> <br /> I will not forget the movie, but as "Pi," it's clearly a unique job, but with a lot of fatal errors I really like, 3/10 of me.
