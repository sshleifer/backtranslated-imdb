One is the highest rating I could have given to this movie, considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Hairy Pee, a senseless mess of a movie with many wasted b-list actors who did a better job, written and directed by a guy with the mentality of a 12-year-old boy who smiles and laughs with idiot puns and poop jokes and fart. . For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat of Everyone in the Family) telling Marilu Henner's character that she "rocked both ways" sexually, was an inexpensive attempt at humor indicative of the film's general lameness ... You want well, cheeky humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (only part), Old School or Office Space.
