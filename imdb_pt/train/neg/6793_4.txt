Western director Richard Brooks, who seems completely involved with the genre, keeping all the usual cliches intact. In the early 1900s, horse racing attracted a low-caliber cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave player (James Coburn), an arrogant boy (Jan Michael Vincent) and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly Candice Bergen game). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with predictable arguments as to whether or not a woman should attend), this becomes a rather captivating entry, although one that does not open new paths (instead resembles something of the time of Gary Cooper). Good looking, if the piece is excessively long, it has a masculine style and a great cast, but the mechanisms of the plot become tiring quickly. ** in ****
