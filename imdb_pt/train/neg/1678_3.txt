I'm trying to make a "Holmes with Doors" pun, but I can not put it all together. Properly dirty and edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that Morrison channels at the same time .... but how shy is this movie about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films show this all the time and ignore graphic violence ... as someone famous once said about the double standards of American cinema: "kiss a breast and it's an X, stab it and it's a PG 13 action" .. Wonderland has 14 minutes too, and in the end the spiral of bad taste we are all glad to escape the movies. How many movies are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The mutilated violence and color changes the tone decadent, but the somersault becomes tiresome, as if we were spying nostrils all the time. Taking some tips form the doors and TAXI DRIVER everything becomes forgettable the next day.
