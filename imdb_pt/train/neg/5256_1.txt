The movie starts well. Widowed with new girlfriend and children. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of the director's stupid choices. Like "let's separate". "I'm going down to ..." do what? Stupid Stupid Stupid. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time waiting for it to improve .............. Not difficult.
