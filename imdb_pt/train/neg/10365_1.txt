Horrible. This thriller should have buried. What a mess. Terrible writing, the characters are less than believable. Schlock horrible !! Put some B-stars in a terribly written POS to try to give a little credit, but this fails miserably. If I did not have to write ten lines about this movie, I would have given a review word, which starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it'. <br /> <br /> Horrible, retarded end. Who writes this crap. The end of this film is so artificial, weak is it as if they had no idea what to do with this plot, or simply run out of money. Most likely due to the number of appearances in this movie. Thank goodness these actors are coming out, because that would be a career killer. Good thing to them that almost nobody will see. At least no one important as future investors. It could have ended in a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel out of my precious time. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about it, you'll feel like you've wasted time and never get back.
