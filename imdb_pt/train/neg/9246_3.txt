I refused to watch it when it aired, valuing the memory of the late 1960s series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have known better. Not exactly a remake, and more a parody than a tribute, this program did not know exactly how to play it, and was full of plots and children's characters. The three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in a straightforward role). The supporting cast were only known comedians of Vic and Bob, wanting to be part of the internal joke, and very aware of the situation to be convincing. And CGI, although the effects could not help improve those available 30 years earlier, just dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of screenplays and dialogues. All style and no substance. (And whereas the 1960s show is ridiculed for being too much of its time, this 'update' is now very old-fashioned, with 'Matrix' style fashions, obligatory 'girl power' scenes and less subtle tension between the two leads
