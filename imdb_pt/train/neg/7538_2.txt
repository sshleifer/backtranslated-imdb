I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it strange and completely pointless ... so I decided to snoop a little and get my hands on his 70's copy. Wow. what difference. The original was much better. I wish you all knew that you originally made a statement, your existence has a purpose. It was really the Christian audience that expressed their fear of paganism. If you delve into it, it also makes comments on life, but I do not want to go into details, simply, if you were disappointed and would like to know how it should be, feel free to watch the video. Version of the 70's, a bit dated, but much better.
