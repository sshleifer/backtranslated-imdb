That's what my friend Brian said about this movie after an hour of it. He was not able to avoid napping. I was talking about how he was execrable and finally I gave in and played, having run out of adjectives to "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you want, the pinnacle of hack work. Something so uninspired, so incredibly awful, that all you want to do after seeing it is sitting alone in the dark and not talking to anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this movie is watchable. It is not, not under any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how really unbearable it is. Do not believe me? Gather. <br /> <br /> Granted, as a nation, we in America do not always portray the people of the Middle East in an elegant way. But how about a kid in a sheik outfit bending over in salaam style to a stack of Castrol engine oil bottles? You'll find it here. TAKE IT? THE ARAB WORLD OIL. I could not believe what I was seeing. Having the kid riding planes in a skyscraper would have been more appropriate. Who in their right mind would think it was a funny joke? It's not even close to "cleverly offensive." It sucks and makes you want to punch who got paid to write that piece in the face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, a group of five people named "Landmines" takes the stage at an officers' ball. Okay, are you ready? The joke is that they sing terribly and turn off the key. Why did I write this in caps as well? Because the joke is POUND, POUND, PASSED ON YOUR HEAD with a marathon of HORRENDOUS visual jokes. They start mediocre enough; glasses cracking, punching cups breaking ... then there, I'm 100% serious, a two-frame stop-motion sequence of A WOMAN'S SHOES LEAVING. You read that correctly - the music was so bad, in one frame, the woman's feet were on. Not too close, the shoes are out !!! I understood, because the music was so bad, her shoes came out! What the F ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless assemblage of images to show the point where the SINGING IS BAD. If any human being really suffered in this scene in the theater without running like hell, I would be amazed. This movie is honestly a joke to see how fast people would walk out the doors. Robert Downey Sr. directs comedy in the way his son demands respect, remaining drug free. Seriously. Other things to note: 1. Popular music is used whenever possible. Every time Liceman shows up, a really inappropriate song from Iggy Pop is played. Also, all the actors do their best to act like it's really cold for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. Barbara Bach's criminally horrible accent. She seems to be trying to speak like a baby while wrapping a marble on her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes in which the boys moan and squirm from a glimpse of their neckline as if they were in a community school class and have been instructed to act like excited backward people. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman feeds his revolting dog with a condom. Remember; when this movie came out casting on "abortion" and "condom" was seen as "daring". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a pedophile and hungry boy, when Hollywood thought that "pedophile" and "homosexual" were one of them. Flat-out embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. Watch the end. Nothing is wrong with your VCR. This is really the end. Tell me it does not make you want to blow up everyone who has ever made a movie, ever. <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk. Even the Academy is known for making other films, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less funny simply by putting the videotape near them.
