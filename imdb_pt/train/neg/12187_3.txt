Worse of Niro Scorsese collaboration in this horrible and violent and agonizing mess. Scorsese is totally out of his element in this movie with the horror clich√© suddenly loud phone ringing and door banging tricks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman. The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the cutest lawyer in history who would never believe he could defend anyone! De Niro's psychotic bowden is nothing more than the typical killer psychopath of the '90s. The scene with De Niro and Lewis early on is very embarrassing and the climax continues and we all must be more than tired of the persecuting psychopath who never Dies. One of my most horrible movie experiences. Rent the original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
