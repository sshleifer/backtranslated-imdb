"The True Story of Jesse James" (1957), by Fox, is a remarkable widescreen remake of his prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic, "Jesse James." I'm not sure where the fault lies, but the cast of this version of the two central characters, Nicholas Ray's jerky direction and the screwdriver script certainly must have something to do with it. In the late 1930s and 1940s, Tyrone Power was the leader of Fox, but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio boss Darryl Zanuck began to prepare newcomer Robert Wagner to take its place. This was a big mistake on Zanuck's part, as Wagner proved to be a less than adequate substitute. With the possible exceptions of "Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven & Hell" (1956), it's hard to think of Wagner distinguishing himself in anything! In addition, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a player hired by Fox before being hired to play Frank James in Wagner's Jesse in "The Real Story of Jesse James." Lent in the studio the previous year, the distinguished brand of this actor was his excellent and revealing performance in John Ford's classic "The Searchers." But playing here, along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers, is nothing short of boring. No player brings personality or color to their respective roles. They totally miss the mark, lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by Power and Fonda in the original. The film is also marked by many flashbacks and with Wagner's script all over the place, like the American West Robin Hood, he appears as an uninspired introvert idiot that you can not feel any empathy for anything. The support cast is not worth mentioning, but it's a shame to see an actress as big as Agnes Moorhead, who can barely see Ma James. <br /> <br /> The best aspects of this so little Western are the wonderful cinemascope / color cinematography by the great Joe McDonald and the excellent score of the underrated and little-known songwriter Leigh Harline!
