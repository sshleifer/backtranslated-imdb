I'm not one of those who think King is a great writer, his books are great distractions for a few hours, and often have interesting premises, however, in my opinion, crumble quickly if you give them some serious thought. This movie suffers from being a fairly accurate reenactment of King's story. If you've read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no changes in scenes or characters. This is a movie made by King fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there's nothing terrible about the movie, it's a 'damn' horror, with its twist being the curse something that many people want, to become thinner. The final third has some serious structural problems, and the somewhat forced end seems to break the rules a bit. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you can also read the book because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
