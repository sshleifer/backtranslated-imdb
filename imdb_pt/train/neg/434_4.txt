His first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious. <br /> <br /> When a rejection by Jehovah's Witnesses receives their own documentary on films? or anything for that matter - it's time for someone to get their own. Although far, far smarter than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult), Zizek's mouth overflows as much as hers, just a different kind. It combines the worst of both their professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the b * ls *** osopher expert enough leeway to create unlikely theories, to complain without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly in the process by misusing the English language by creating a semantics. confusion only a mother can love. Example: there are three main brothers of Marx, hence the "great" idea of ​​connecting them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego, and the superego. I'm a little surprised he did not play a clip of "Snowhite" and make an analogy between the seven dwarves and the seven levels of Gahannah (Muslim Hell). It's like the premise of Schumacher's "Number 23": playing with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking the ancient Greeks to the death of Princess Di. <br /> <br /> There is an element of entertainment for the TPGTC: watching a delirious lunatic sweat like a pig while uttering masked delirious songs like intellectual analysis can be quite fun. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other hospice drama when you can have Zizek for over 2 hours? It's like watching a fun train disaster. Of course, he's almost funny on one or two occasions. <br /> <br /> I've always been confused by people who desperately try to elevate filmmaking in an exalted intellectual social science. Giving stupid movies like "Birds" that much thought, hence this credit, probably has your fat creator laughing in his grave. The crude truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few who have any intelligence do not need a psychiatrist philosopher to draw a map to understand them? unless one is a complete idiot. Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal films. Hallucinogenic drugs must be quite popular and cheap in Slovenia today ... When Zizek showed the tub hole in the "Psycho" shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; how they drain the life of stars just as the hole in the tub sucks Janet Leigh's blood. Or maybe he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with blood flowing to her instead of coming out (as in menstruation), this represents some kind of "intelligent irony (zizekian)." Speaking of which, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really thought much about each scene (and script), his films would not be the illogical and absurd crap that they used to be. The purpose of these tub-hole analogies was to show how easy it is to improvise about "hidden and deep meanings." And when you add Zizek's fanciful terminology of philosophy and psychology, putting these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you have an inordinate confusion that can instantly impress the ignorant - that is, the easily impressionable and ingenuous . <br /> <Zizek expresses a series of funny (unintentional) things here, one of the most absurd ideas is when he associates Anthony Perkins's cleanliness of the bloody bathroom with "job satisfaction, a job well done." Do not laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of "Psycho" could have even vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might be enjoying a job well done - cleaning a bloodstained bathroom - while they were designing / directing it. scene. Talk about putting words in someone's mouth (dead), but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to "say". <br /> <br /> I like Zizek's early thoughts on Tarkovsky's fantastic "Solaris", but he has ruined a rare good impression by dragging "anti-feminism" and other nonsense to his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude toward logic is that of a dog toward his plastic bone. "I just want to play with this all day!" Logic has its rules and should not be raped - at least not publicly - by people like it. He seems to regard logic, proof, common sense, and reason as enemies or mere disposable toys; concepts to be avoided, distorted to suit the ultimate goal or simply annihilated. Zizek is the hippie fooled by LSD, and all his favorite movies are his "2001" personal. <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and those whose films often lack intelligence, if anything - like Hitchcock and Lynch only further diminish their already low credibility. I was surprised by De Palma not having more prominence; this is another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible "Lost Road". There are as many interpretations of this film as there are people who have watched. <br /> <br /> Zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts von Trier's laughable, "innovative" arrangement in Dogville. I smile. <br /> <br /> However, Zizek not only invents things, but also delivers strongly to the "obvious obvious". Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), it involves its very trivial "observations" in articulated blankets (if full of spitting) and sometimes complex of language. After all, sociology works in precisely the same way: it makes us believe that we are hearing something new, when in fact it is what we all already know, but said eloquently - which deceives the listener more inattentive. <br /> I was half expecting men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and arrest him in a blond suit ... Slavoj Zizek: soon as a stalker in a playground near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
