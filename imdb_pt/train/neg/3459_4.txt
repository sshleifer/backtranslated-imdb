"Cut" is a movie about some movie students making a movie. It's a lot in the cast of "Scream," an ironic and self-referential horror film that, to me at least, falls because, despite all its irony, it's still just a bad horror movie, like the movies it refers to. <br /> But it was not without its charms. Well, a charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as the fumbling American actress who hates every minute of work with the amateur Australian movie crew. She was so compelling that it's tempting to believe it was not an act, although everyone involved with "Cut" would say she was lovely to work with. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of your pouting, annoyance or snapping was great. All others, however, hesitated to be OK and be terribly wooden. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Cut" has some laughs, some bloodsuckers (some surprisingly horrible) and finally it's ... another bad horror movie.
