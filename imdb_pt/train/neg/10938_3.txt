I was not expecting much, but I was still disappointed. This was my favorite Halestorm production I've ever seen. I thought it should be a comedy, but I just laughed 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a funny joke to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down several times? What was with the janitor in the scene of Heaven? Fred Willard was hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations, but that did not work. They must have spent the entire budget to make the "known" actors appear in this because there was no lighting budget. It looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most of the scenes were very dark. Does it take a lot of film to show that someone actually shoots and makes a basket instead of cutting and editing a ball going through a basket? I try not to be so critical of low budget comedies but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie.
