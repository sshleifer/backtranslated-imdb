When I was younger, I thought the first movie was really good in my childhood, so I decided to see the sequel. This is an example of why some movies should not have sequences because the first movie is usually the best, and it is. Basically, now that Ariel and Eric are married, they have a daughter who is not allowed away from home because they are worried about Ursula's sister (the legged octopus villain from the movie one), Morgana coming up to her. When the child leaves, she asks Ursula's sister to turn her into a mermaid, as her mother was. That makes Ariel go back to the sea to find her. The same good voice artists, it's just the story that could have thought a little more. Suitable!
