Egyptian movies have a lot of films with high level of drama or romance or comedy or even sports action ... "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" was banned in Egypt because it is content nude (Full Frontal Female Nudity) and This Kind Of Nudity Is Forbidden In Egyptian Movies .. When I Saw This Movie I Felt Down ... Story Of Fool .. Naked Actress .. Bad Action .. Some Horror & Hard Colors .. Dear Friend .. If You Want To See One great Egyptian movie ... Simply: Stay away form "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" ..
