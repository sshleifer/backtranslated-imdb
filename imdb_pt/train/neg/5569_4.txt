I tried to like this movie, really. Watching him, all I can think is, "This guy gives me shivers, I would have gotten a restraining order." Also calls the CODEPENDÃŠNCIA in capital letters. Was this really the talk before making the movie? "Let's make a movie that puts two chronically depressed and socially inept people in a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" From what I've seen in life is that the last thing on earth that we find attractive in a potential partner is constant self-pity. <br /> <br /> The mood of the film is distinctly 80-ish; shocking and slow. Do not get me wrong, the movie has its moments, just a few of them.
