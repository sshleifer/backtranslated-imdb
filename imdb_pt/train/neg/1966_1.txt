I was fooled into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another site and the man was me p.o'd !!! It took me at least 15 minutes to get it on the shelf b / c I did not want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and really use real money to rent it. I thought all my stress would pay the moment I got home and watch the movie b / c the review I read said the movie was a pleasant surprise; what a joke! if you can get through the first hour of the movie then you're in luck! b / c is not until then the movie turns into a horror. do not bother with these folks, you better watch "dankness falls"
