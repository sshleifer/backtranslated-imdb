Well, should I start? This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever paid good money to see. I will not comment on the story itself, it is a wonderful classic, but here it seems like a novel. To begin with, the acting, with the exception of Eric Bana, is the quality of the novel. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor in The Bold and the Beautiful embarrasses him. The camera action also does not help. How long it lasts when you're thinking, it just takes me back to the days of Brooke Forrester in the lab! Peter O'Toole has had a really bad plastic surgery, or he's desperately in need of one. Anyway, he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! And to finish off my comments, Diane Kruger is a cute girl, but she sure is not a Helen of Troy. Peterson should rather choose Saffron Burrows for the part, since Elizabeth Taylor would already be somewhat wrong.
