I just watched "El Otro". I always took off my hat for the presentations of Julio Chavez, since he is a great actor, but this film is really depressing and slow. I think it would have been even worse if it had not been for Julio. Anyway, this is definitely a movie that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I advise you not to rent this movie to have a good time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends. ..is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make much sense either. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is annoy and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I definitely did not like this movie.
