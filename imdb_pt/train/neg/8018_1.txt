Wow, I hated this movie. The subject should have resulted in a really good film, and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the subject, but the script - if there is * was * a script - is a mess. This is less a movie than a random slide show that leads to nothing. I'd say it's not fast, except it's the longest 81 minutes you've ever sat. As I mentioned, the lead actor is good. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?), Like her mother sometimes rough but who finally loves and accepts. Filmmakers have a lot to answer around here, because that's a mess. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like this movie, but it's basically a movie that was never made. Skip this one - not even worth the $ 6 I paid for pay-per-view.
