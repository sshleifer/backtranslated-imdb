I rarely comment on movies, but I read the other reviews and I can not believe there are people cheering on this celluloid rubbish. I know there are certain people who have their own agenda, but let's consider it merely; acted badly, barely shot and the story was felt when the director was making up what was happening. I'm not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the movie involving small children, since the creators of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what the audience wanted. All I can say is that it's a terrible movie, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateurish and I'm glad they can not make a movie like this legally today
