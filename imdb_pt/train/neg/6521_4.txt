I'm probably not giving a fair shake to this movie, since I could not watch all of this. Maybe if I had seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, I might have enjoyed it, but it's too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago and plot details have faded from memory. That did not help the film, since it is something less vivid and clear in its presentation of events. <br /> <br /> That's actually four linked movies, or a four-part film, and it was, I believe, intentional. to be seen over four nights in a theatrical performance. I found Part I quite pleasant, but it was all I could do to sit in Part II, which trails endlessly. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you get a good translation or you can read it in the original, your brilliant writing far outweighs any problem you may have with the pace of the story. In movies, however, it is difficult to reproduce without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with the parts of the movie that I saw. It's very flashy with a lot of camera work that draws attention to itself rather than serve to advance the story. <br /> <br /> Clearly, I'm missing something, but I just could not muster the enthusiasm to increase parts III and IV.
