Okay, let me share it for you ... It's HORRIBLE! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such a fancy job in the early Cruel Intentions, then why did he do such a bad job? I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, true that may have improved if your series was aired, but let's be realistic ... this movie a pot! A lot of bad acting * NOTE The shower scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What kind of line is this? "Slipery when wet" ?????????? We can say DUH-M! This movie had an effort, I'll give it to you, but it was very dumb! They even tried to make it funny, giving stupid housekeepers the accents that actually ... IT WAS NOT FUNNY! It was pathetic. Not to mention they made everyone look at ANYTHING NOTHING like the original cast. It's as if they make them look different on purpose or something! I like to watch when I really am really a board that does not happen occasionally. For those of you who liked ... Ok, what were you thinking? Could you choose this movie about the other who had great acting and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? A movie is gold if you have Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this movie no, no offense Amy Adams. Oh, since when Sebastain has a heart ????? UGH!
