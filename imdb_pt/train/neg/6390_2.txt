I've seen about a thousand horror movies. (my favorite type) This movie is among the worst. To me, an idea drives a movie. So even a poorly executed and cheap movie can be good. Something strange is definitely made cheap. However, you have little to say. I still do not understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the movie. Something Strange has little to offer. Save yourself the pain!
