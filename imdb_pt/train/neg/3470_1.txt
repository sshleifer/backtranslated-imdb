As with most of Ben Affleck's films, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. That is, if you want to call it a story. Many points were left connected without any thought. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say this because, that would mean that torture would have lasted longer. As for any failure of Ben Affleck, this is not an exception and can only be survived by the other actors. Even so, acting for the most part was artificial and unbelievable. The journey down memory lane with actors I have not seen in years was not worth the price of admission. Everyone thought it should be said, they are also quickly joining the ranks of the "has-been". My choice was to wait for my car to be repaired or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all, I'd have a laugh ... mostly because that's all I got out of it.
