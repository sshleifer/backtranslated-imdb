Funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float. Of course they used several actors for Batman, but in that case, Batman was a classic character before any actor put on his cover. In this case, you had a classic character in the glasses with blonde horn hoops wearing Ralphy who wanted a red gun for Christmas ... Somehow we should forget about it and accept another little boy who bears no resemblance to the original. If I did not know it was a sequel, I would not have guessed by the cast ... except, of course, that Charles Grodin tries to imitate both Darrin McGavin that you are constantly reminded that the original was much better ... < in the end it could have work if they had released the movie better. They should have sought appearances or simply ignored the original and not attempted to copy their appearance. This is just a cheap imitation. Ralphy does not evoke sympathy only for the desire to appear that his character shoots or dies.
