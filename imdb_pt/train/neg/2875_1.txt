This is the biggest piece of crap ever. It seems they spent more time, effort and money making the cover of the DVD than in the actual movie. I actually thought the DVD had been traded with somebody's homemade porn until I recognized one of the cover actors. This movie looks like somebody did with a hundred dollars and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats. The image is really clear, but this, along with unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it like that, production, acting, if that's what they're doing, and script, if they had one, make this movie look worse than an old porn. At least the old porn has a dot. It seems that some PETA members came together and decided to make a really disturbing, nonsensical PSA about the rights and feelings of animals. This is not worth the money or the time. It has nothing in common with BTK serial killer, besides the name of the killer and some of the victims. The people who made this movie should be happy that he is not yet free, or he may have come after them just to ruin this movie so much.
