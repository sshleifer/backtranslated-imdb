Thunderbirds (2004) Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Starring: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5? 4 ' 3 ' ? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds are GO! <br /> <br /> And so began the Thunderbirds, one of my childhood favorites. When I heard they were going to make a Thunderbird movie, I was ecstatic. I could not wait to see Thunderbird 2 roar to save people, while Thunderbird 4 would dive deep into the idea you had. I just could not wait. Then came August 2004, when the movie was finally released. Critics criticized, but I still wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, that was all that mattered to me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager in a crowd of 50 people was over thirty and less than ten. Quite possibly the strangest theater experience I've ever had? <br /> <br /> The film (intended to be a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest of the Tracy family. He spends his days wishing he can rescue people like the rest of his family, but he is too young. One day, he finally gets his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) arrests the rest of his family in Thunderbird 5 (the space station). That implies that he has to be smarter than The Hood henchmen and rescue his family in time before The Hood steals all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, the plot sounds like a regular episode of Thunderbirds. when you read on paper. Once it's put to film, what a mess we have in our hands. Firstly, the film was aimed at children, much like the original show. However, Gerry Anderson treated us as adults and gave us quite advanced plots for children's programming. This, on the other hand, changes the plot as he tries to become an imbecile of the Spy Kids franchise. The final product is a film that tries to please the fans of the Thunderbirds series and the children, while both are missing. Insulting jokes, silly cartoons and antics that no one finds fun are everywhere in this movie, and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes is wishing he never directed it. <br /> <br /> Most of all, everyone gave a solid performance considering the script they received. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood, playing the role extremely well. My only complaint about the characters is about The Hood's henchmen, who are reduced to leftovers from old Looney Tunes cartoons, fumbling while surprisingly children take them with ease. <br /> <br /> What's weird about this movie is that while I was watching the movie, I had fun. But as soon as the lights came on, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, I was $ 8 lighter, and two hours of my time was over. A guilty pleasure? Possibly. Nevertheless, the Thunderbirds are a forgettable mess. Instead of a big "go", I'll have to recommend that you stay away from this movie. If the rest of the movie could have been like the first ten minutes, it would have been an incredible movie worthy of the name Thunderbirds. However, we have a movie that only fans of Thunderbirds (if you would like to watch your childhood in pieces) or the extremely bored should bother about it. My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½. stars.
