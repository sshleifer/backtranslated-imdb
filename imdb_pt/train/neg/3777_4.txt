Flat, soulless computer images, with less than amazing backgrounds, enliven a terribly predictable story in this movie. Absolutely nothing catches you by surprise, you can even tell when Bryan Adams's vocals are coming, they are always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit the horse, gets bored. voice when he tells what is happening. Narration is not necessary, however, as everything that is happening is really obvious. You can even tell what the horses are saying, though everything they do is neighbor. Which would be nice, but all horses make exactly the same sounds - one to warn, one to sadness, one to laugh, etc. There is no variation between the voices of the horses. <br /> <br /> Young kids can like this movie, though. It's cute enough for a family to sit and watch, and there's little danger of anyone getting scared. If you have nothing else to do, and want to watch a movie with your kids, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But, on the other hand, this is not recommended.
