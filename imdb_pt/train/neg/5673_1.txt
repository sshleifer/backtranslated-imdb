I quote Oedpius Rex because it's a tragedy that this movie was made !!! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I'm by no means an enemy of Uwe Boll like most people without humor in IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll's films like Postal and Tunnel Rats are hilarious and therefore entertaining. But honestly, this movie was just awful. I hated it so much that I would give it a rating of zero stars if I could. The story sucks! He spends four fifths of the movie building the plot and then they have the medium that is just grizzly murder scenes horrible made tasteless! The end finally with a "villain wins ending" which is totally acceptable but surely could have been more tasteful than this! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said before) nor am I against violent movies! I love violent movies! I loved the Saw movies, the Hostel movie, the Tokyo Gore police, the New York Ripper, the 28 movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on the left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, all Tarantino films, Sam Peckinpah, even Canibal f ** king Holocaust! But that! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> That was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! And look at the movies I just listed! If I liked the Cannibal Holocaust and not this then it must be bad! Uwe, do not look all dark again! You're funny when you have a good heart, just like Ed Wood. This was just a terrible experience! I felt horrible after seeing this! <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE !!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!!
