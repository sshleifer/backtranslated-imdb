This film is an attempt to present the Jared Diamonds theory of "weapons, germs and steel," explaining how Europeans have dominated much of the globe. <br /> <br /> The version I saw of this documentary came in 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think the information could have been submitted in 20 minutes. There are completely useless scenes of: Professor Jared Diamond watching birds through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond failing to use a bow and arrow correctly, Professor Jared Diamond firing a muzzle loader gravely. This documentary was supposed to make a hero of "Professor Jared Diamond?". This part of the documentary was so bad it could have been a parody. The worst was when Diamond is shown fainting and crying while visiting the malaria ward in an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of "guns, germs, and steel." BTW, "guns, germs and steel" is said about 100 times. "Can Europeans, guns, germs and steel get them out of this terrible situation? Stay tuned and find out!" When he finally gets down to business, his theory is equally interesting and utterly boring. The Europeans conquered the indigenous peoples from other lands because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wood weapons. Do I really need a teacher to convince me of this? The parts of his theory that explain how the Europeans came to have the advantages that allow conquest are interesting, but the coverage is very thin. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the documentary was just trying to convince me that non-Europeans are just as capable as Europeans. If I'm not racist, I know that. If I'm racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me with his awkward use of native instruments. <br /> <br /> I do not think adults are the intended audience for this documentary. Kids can enjoy this more than I do, though. I read the book of which this documentary is much better than the documentary.
