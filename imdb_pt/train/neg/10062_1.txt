Nintendo !!! YOU #% $ @ ERS !!! How can you do this to me? I can not believe ... this movie is actually worse than the first one. I went to see this in the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to go along ... oh God ... where do I start? The plot sucked. The dubbing was sucked. The animation was sucked. The final REALLY SUCCESSFUL. If you liked this movie, YOU SUCK TOO. And for Futuramafan1987, who said that this was the best movie of all time, you are a TOOL, SIMPLE AND SIMPLE. This is not a movie for anyone other than ten year old boys with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God. I'm still crying to-day thinking about that horrible shit from a movie ... and then there was Pikachu's Adventure ... do not even make me get into that horrible mess of a movie. It is, in fact, one of the most boring experiences of my entire life. Do not go watch this at any cost. <br /> <br /> In short: Get out, find all the copies of the movie that you can and burn. Burn them all, and then proceed to rent a good movie, like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even Back to the Future!
