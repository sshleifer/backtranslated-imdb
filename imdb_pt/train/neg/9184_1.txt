F * ck me! I've seen some incredibly awful movies in my time, but that takes p * ss! <br /> <br /> Honestly I can not express in words how bad this movie really is. Aside from the plot that is not really there, the comically acting crap, the hilariously awful excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this movie is stupid, nonsense, crap or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie ... do not do it! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say, I have it in my rack. It's hiding well on the damn bottom of the huge pile. I could not even give that excuse for a movie away. That's how bad it is.
