If you liked "Blair com" you will like this one. It has the same camera work and soundtrack, and has the same non-existent plot and moments of suspense. <br /> <br /> He also has Tom Savini, so if you like "Dawn of the Dead" by Romero or Tarantino and Rodriguez "From Dusk Till Dawn" you're in for a surprise. He's an icon and a great actor too. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie is definitely the worst movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen some movies - the bad ones too. I can tell you that I find most horror movies fun in some ways, but that was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was the naked girls and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth ... No, I'm just joking. I must have missed before clicking "submit" on the voting form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if you have sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
