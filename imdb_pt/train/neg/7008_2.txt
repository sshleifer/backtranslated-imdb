Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really very upset that someone stole the Corvette that he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (possibly the ugliest car to be featured in a movie), and goes to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who stole his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I would have ripped my eyes out after watching this, if it were not for the fun of seeing Annie Potts in a very precocious role, and it's also Bad for Hamill that he did not take some acting lessons from her. Danny Bonaduce also plays a ridiculous part.
