I have seen many horror shows over the years, such as Nightstalker, who dealt with the legend of Wendigo, so I was looking forward to an angry spirit causing clutter to add flavor to the Halloween season. The man was wrong. The whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and scary but then provides a very simplistic story of revenge and murder about losing some property. Ve-ery scary - no! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. <br /> <br /> It's getting harder and harder to believe anything Hollywood does about horror movies, since they rarely come up with something original and scary. . What idiots pay for a fake movie like that? Go back to the guys on the clipboard and do something useful with those millions of dollars you have to play around.
