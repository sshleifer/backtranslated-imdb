It's a very good cast, but the film does not have a bit of grace from the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street." Anyone who is looking for a fun caper movie should visit the original. William Macy may be one of our greatest living actors, but here he is little used. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I kind of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes. He could also try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The art direction is rich and textured, but brings nothing to the story, the extra bits they add to the story seem completely unnecessary and the things they take away are lost. Even starting the way they do seems absurdly free and takes the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his strange and genial charm and Luis Guzman has this strange charisma, but the love story part of the film seems awkward and flat. It's a shame that no one has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was made, but then again, it's a shame that we live in a culture where we feel we need to redo incredible things instead of simply learning to savor the originals.
