I wanted to like this movie, I really liked it. It has some good actors but, in the end, it falls flat. He tries very hard to be funny in some places (daughters with zealous cooking attempts), elsewhere (the scene where they clean someone's yard, so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that, while slightly interesting , are just fills (all the work scenes). And I did not find "villains" intimidating or hateful as much as I found them childishly annoying. <br /> <br /> I met people like those in the movie while playing church ball. And I'll say the referee is on the spot. Still, in the end, I do not really care so much about the characters, or their quest for the glory of church balls. Maybe because everyone was so one-dimensional, I might not have cared enough if the movie was funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale, and Halestorm Entertainment, made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
