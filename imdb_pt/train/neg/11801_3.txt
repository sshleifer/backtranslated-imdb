As a big fan of the original movie, it's hard to watch this show. The gaudy set decoration and the strongly lit ensembles steal any style of this remake. Humor is never there. Instead, it looks like so many television movies from the seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but his grumpy wardrobe and his apartment do not match the mood of the original, or make him an interesting character. He does his best for this to work, but Samantha Egger is really bad choice. The English accent and the looks of California can not handle Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. Lee J.Cobb tries powerfully to create Barton Keyes, but even his performance is just rude, with no style. <br /> <br /> It looks like the TV movie that was and again reminds me of that remarkable movie the original still is.
