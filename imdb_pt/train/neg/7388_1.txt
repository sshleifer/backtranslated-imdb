drss1942 really took the words out of my mouth. I loved the first Segal movies and I feel like the only one who is still true to him. I just watched this movie (okay, I fell asleep about 90%, so I did not see the ending). When I woke up and saw that it was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I did not submit to this movie and did not dare to find out what happened at the end. There was something strange in Segal's voice and others. I sort of remembered the original Mad Max, where the voice was dubbed, but in the same language (Australlian is English, right? :) Anyway, if I had 10 thumbs, they would point to this Segal injustice.
