I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I liked. However, this failure seemed to last forever. It's one of those movies that likes the sad positioning of the PG-13 while it's not suitable for children. Jokes are not just low or low jokes, they are coarse, lewd, and many acts cross borders not just for bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency. Many scenes seem to have been cut to get PG-13 rating ... too bad ... could have made a bigger movie like an R-rated movie if the funny one was left inside. (Exaggeration? Probably.) I do not recommend this movie. It's a total waste of time ... and I'm a movie lover and ready to give anything. At 45 minutes, the movie seemed to be running out ... and the boy was ready for it. The ending is quaint, but it does not rescue the rest of this quagmire / tourist trap of a rental. 1/2 star (glad I saw him as a toast ... would have been angry to pay sweaty greenbacks for this gut)
