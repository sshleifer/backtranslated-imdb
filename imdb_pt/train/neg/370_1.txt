Blank check is easily one of the worst movies of the nineties. The plot is completely useless; your tones of loneliness are pathetic. Do you really believe that a twelve-year-old kid acting as the personal assistant of a millionaire could accomplish everything in this movie, like buying a mansion for a mere $ 300,000. The notion, not to mention the bargain price, will only be credited by the more credulous viewers. Please respect your intelligence and do not watch this horrible and horrible movie.
