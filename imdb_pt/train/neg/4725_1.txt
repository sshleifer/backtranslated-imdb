A great opportunity for the director of Indy to make an interesting movie about a rock musician on the brink of stardom. It could have been a decent movie if it had dealt with John Livien's traumatic past and how he was torturing his psyche. Instead, it's a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon. The hero of John Livien's suicidal mother was John Lennon and she wished him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance and his wonderful ability to learn about his own life, he showed that Lennon's legacy was that of a confused, drug-addicted soul who was to be seen as a God. men. I'm a big fan of John Lennon and this movie reminded me of someone else "crazy" obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by another person who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we need to be reminded of this? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and I felt repulsed by seeing another disturbed person as the main character of this film obsessed by Lennon, and not show their beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono graciously honored the memory of John Lennon while making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember John. Instead, the director of this movie chose to use this site to have the killer trying to commit suicide. I found it so disruptive and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this place seemed a terrible wound to any Lennon fan. That ruined the movie completely for me. It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and not remember their vicious murder for this irresponsible movie.
