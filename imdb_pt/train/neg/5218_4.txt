All the elements for a bad movie night are in place: dialogue played with biological techno-babble, colorful sets, balsa wood action, a lousy Casio result in the late 80's, and a general look that suggests anything in science . The Fi Channel programming program, around 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" begins with a lot of promise, the film turns into bland idiocy and MST3K style cheese while Clark Kent, aspiring 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is pressure to release information about their secret projects. But when he tests his vague experience of himself, he turns into a vaguely defined creature (who has more than a passing resemblance to "Dr. Freudstein" of "House by the Cemetery"). FX's work is pretty good for such an obviously low-budget production (though I suspect most are kept in the shade for a reason), but overall, "Metamorphosis" leaves a retrograde taste in its guts, despite their hopes to convince us otherwise. I can not but agree with the final comment of a character: "(It was) A nightmare ... of the past!"
