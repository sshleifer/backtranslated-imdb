I had no expectations other than to have fun for 90 minutes, and that's exactly what I was. <br /> <br /> Of course it's exaggerated, of course part of the dialogue was not perfect, of course the "special effects" were a bit cheesy. That's exactly why I really liked the movie. It's a perfect fit for this classic horror genre of the '70s. <br /> <br /> The talent has to start somewhere, this holds true for the actors and the team, and what better piece of material to sharpen their skills? than that. <br /> <br /> I for a look forward to another film of these producers and directors.
