They sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thriller, but I found it very funny (comedy?, I think not), I laughed the whole movie I think it was because of ridiculous acting and plot. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy", I loved her acting in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! she's a beauty and a good actress too, but let's try to be a little objective here, the mm mm story ... the mm mm direction ... missing a lot of good suspense is actually a very annoying movie but there's a good thing , is a short film, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (FOR ME I WAS 10 MINUTES UNDER WATER !!!) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what is wrong with a good, rational and objective criticism?
