This movie has beautiful scenery. Unfortunately there is no plot. To have a plot, there must be a conflict. This movie did not have any. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and could not put any activity on it. The image tries to be artistic, but does not pay attention to the basics of storytelling. <br /> <br /> If you love mountain scenery and fly fishing, you'll find some value in this movie, but do not expect a story. There is not one.
