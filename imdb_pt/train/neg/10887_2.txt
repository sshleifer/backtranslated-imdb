...... this movie is horrible, the only thing that stopped me from giving a grade of 1 was the fact that I have unfortunately seen worse things. <br /> <br /> The music of the jungle, demonic and Fluorescent style UV blood / teeth / eyes give you that "horrible" look, and the script is terrible ..... this movie is more like a test to see How long can you last before giving it up. Also predictable, but not good. Nothing that this movie does is in a good way. I watched 10 minutes ago and thought I'd complain a bit, so you're there. (oh and the acting does not let the movie fall, it's also terrible)
