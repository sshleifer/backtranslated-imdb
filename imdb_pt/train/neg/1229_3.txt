Sorry, but aside from Kim Basinger doing a good job acting in fear, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in a while. Logic is thrown out when 4 young women terrorize this woman out of a crowded mall and then shoot a security guard. However, no one seems to notice. So instead of screaming for help or running back to the mall, she leaves and ends up in the middle of the forest with the guys in pursuit. I can not even describe how foolish it is to see this woman running away from four retarded thugs, carrying a red toolbox, screaming for God to come help her, and then having sex with one after brutally killing others. Please, trust me, this is bad and a bit tasteless too.
