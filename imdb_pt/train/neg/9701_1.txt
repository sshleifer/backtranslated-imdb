A very bad sequence. Part 1 had lots of funny moments - part 2 is bad (in a boring way) and obviously made to take money from the fans. <br /> <br /> What a shame, Otto Waalkes! <br /> <br /> The only slightly entertaining moment in the movie is Helge Schneider, who apparently seems to be stepped on the other characters. It's very easy to identify with him ... <br /> <br /> The script is sloppy / non-existent. The director must do everyone a favor and release him immediately. The acting is worse than a second-round game. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is horrible as well, but who can blame the faces of the director of photography / sound who had to work with a director without talent?
