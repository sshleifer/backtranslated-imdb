Despite a nice general plot and costly production, you wonder how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese wardrobes and cultural consultants? Not on payroll apparently. A Japanese friend, in fact, laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes. In a later conversation, she said, "Imagine a Finnish director making a Finnish film about the American Civil War using Swedish blond actors as Union Armies and Frenchmen as the Confederates. Worst imagine wearing Scarlet O'Hara's female lead in a Perhaps some people in Finland may not realize that the hoop skirt was "missing the hoop" or recognize Jane Mansfield's bizarre hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears .... and be laughing in the corridors ... great history and photography damn it. So ... watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, Real geisha or Japanese outfits, and that was the theme of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of the cinema. They usually get big things right money, leaving the details that realmen I polish a refinement of embarrassingly wrong films. I thought "The Last Samurai" was the crowning achievement of how bad would be a good film about Japan. Memories of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.
