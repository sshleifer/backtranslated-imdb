.... And after seeing this pile of crap you will not be surprised that it was not published! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie to any standard, but when I say that it is one of the worst movies that has the name Stephen King in the credits, you can begin to imagine how bad it is. is . The movie begins with two characters staring open-mouthed at a horror scene: "My God, what happened here?" "I do not know, but they sure hate cats." The camera moves outside a house where hundreds of cats are hung dead and mutilated. Boy, this guy is right, somebody hates cats and with a deduction like that he should be a cop. Oh, wait a minute, he's a cop, and when a movie starts with a cop making such an obvious remark, you just know is going to watch a bad movie <br /> <br /> The reason why SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it is very illogical and confusing. <br /> <br /> We finally discovered that the title monsters need the blood of virgins to survive. to find a virgin in the Midwest biblical belt instead of an American coastal town? Having said that we at least know the motives of the monsters - that's the only thing we learn.We never learn how they are able to change shape or are capable to make cars invisible here and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the TERMINATOR. Mother monster walks killing several cops with their own hands or blasting them through a police handgun (!), But if your monster breed is immune to the police firepower, why do creatures need to change shape or stay invisible The disappearance of the creatures is equally ill thought of as being killed by a mass attack of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, then why did not the monsters kill all the cats that were scattered around the garden? There was a whole horde of moggies sitting around, but the monsters never thought about killing them. I think that's how the production team can come to an end. <br /> <br /> We are treated to several scenes where famous horror film directors like John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King make appearances. I think the reason for this is that whenever an unknown actor reads the script, they immediately decide that, no matter what, they will not appear in such a bad movie so Stephen King had to phone his terror friends to fill out the cast. That's how bad SLEEPWALKERS is <br /> <br /> * Unbelievable as it seems that was not the worst line in the movie. The worst line is - "That cat saved my life"
