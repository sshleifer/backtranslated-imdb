I understand this movie was done on a very low budget, but that's no excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. The Death Stalker, Fire Throne, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Invincible Barbarian were all made with tight budgets and bad special effects, but still managed to create cult classics by adding some warrior women in meager clothes and a good sense of humor. humor. Primitive costumes, dark castles and the beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a good sword film and low-budget witchcraft, but the manufacturers completely ruined this opportunity using CGI effects and extremely bad color characters. Compare this movie with Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it's a good example of how a fun science fiction / low budget adventure movie can be made using credible special effects and engaging characters.
