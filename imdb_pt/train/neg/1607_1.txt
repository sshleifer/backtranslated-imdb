This "documentary" is proof that talent is being used for purposes. The fact that it is funded by the Venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of looking for the truth of what really happened in those horrible April 2002 days in Venezuela, something that we Venezuelans do not know for sure. /> There are ways to lie, and the directors of this material lie both by omission and by knowledge. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by the foreign public, and they take advantage of it. For example * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * they show pro-Chávez demonstrators firing on an empty street (what the hell did they do that for?) In a way of saying they did not kill anyone but did not bother to show the images we all saw here, of opposition protesters (and a journalist) falling dead or wounded across the "empty" street. They can not explain why the political police helicopter was the only one allowed to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers who were on all the roofs of the buildings near the presidential palace, something that would show how inefficient it would be to be measures to protect the President. A few days after the "coup", the head of the military guard in charge was questioned at the National Assembly (our Congress) why they did not act against the snipers and he said "because they were not there to act against them." the president, "is not it a confession? <br /> <br /> There is much more, the fact that the highest military rank announced that Chávez had resigned and two days later he said that he lied because" this is politics. "and today is the Minister of Home Affairs of the Chavez administration. It would take thousands of words to explain all the lies portrayed in this" documentary, "made with the intention of selling to the world an image of the good old Hugo Chavez who governs the poor and the oppressors rich and bad who want it at all costs, when the truth is that 60-70% of people reject his government, and that percentage includes the poor. /> I hope those who have seen and bought will be able to see a different version being made and a group of Venezuelans showing no less than 30 lies. <br /> <br /> Nazi propaganda has returned!
