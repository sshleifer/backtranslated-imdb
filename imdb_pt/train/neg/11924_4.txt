RUN ... do not stray from this movie !!!!! Intended for very young children, this movie will bore you with tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 90s raised the bar, this movie only lowered it. It is slow and the fighting monster is good but rarely seen. This movie made me dry in the cat's box. Just a very poor offer after a phenomenal series of the 90s. SPOILERS BEYOND THE POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons why Gamera fans in the '90s hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This movie is a drama that follows a child trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing the baby Gamera to a fight after learning that his father saw the adult Gamera die. <br /> <br /> 9. You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the movie. Does he get his butt kicked by some Gyaos and self-destruct ??? He looks old and lethargic. Plus, it looks nothing like any game you've ever seen. His suit looked cheap and rushed. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the movie looks like a Pok√©mon. With big eyes and cute ... will remember the baby Godzilla of Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now very cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie has the rhythm of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I watched this movie with two other Gamera fans and no one was happy with how slow the movie was going. I saw an SUV full of fat people climbing a mountain road moving faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie had very little kaiju time on the screen. The Final Wars had much more, in fact, and better fights, though short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take on the lead role. The theme of the friend of all children and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 70's and the story repeats itself in the 2000s. Gamera's most successful films abandoned the feel of Sesame Street and went to a darker place. Why return to a failed formula? This would be a new trilogy and the weak ticket sales killed any hope that this story would continue (thank god). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost its iconic roar. He now looks like an elephant with sore throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie can produce a new Olympic event ... Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children to the path of danger. You have to see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yeah ... right there sending your kids to a kaiju battle zone. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good, but sub-par for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was to show the Gamera fly, the size of an apple. It's not very impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is not what adult kaiju fans expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and shows. It leaves as a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Congratulations if you know all 3 references. <br /> <br /> Rent at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series.
