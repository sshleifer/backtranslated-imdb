This movie is terrible. The story is about a woman trying to figure out what happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, ranging from Noir / Thriller to erotic, with elements of horror released to good measure. The film has a very confusing structure, for example, with the frequent use of flashbacks without linking them to the story. The plot is poorly developed, and characterization made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and the role they were playing. Some implausibilities exist in many movies, but the scene in which the main protagonist willingly accompanies a virtual stranger in his home, then agrees to climb alone (to where he says he will find a phone), minus the weapon she brought with she. calling the police was very hard to believe. Part of the cinematography is really bad: we were watching on a 42-inch TV, so as someone with a smaller set could find out what was happening in the scenes taken in the almost complete darkness is beyond me. Overall, a chaotic mess.
