Comedy of a note that probably puts the teeth of modern feminists on the edge. Department store clerk Betsy Drake is passionate about the idea of ​​babies and marriage, casting her hopes in women's magazines until she spies the super bait in the form of the elegant bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the film goes from ploy to ploy while the relentless Drake pursues his prey. I think the word "cheerful" just about the sum of Drake's approach to the role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her dentures, I started to overdose. Grant's role is basically secondary and less his usual talent. There is one scene, however, that almost regains this slender exercise. Drake asks the unhappy Grant after his lecture to a room full of respectable ladies. Here her cheerful moods have an unforced freshness that is really remarkable, and if production did not rub our noses at that 90-minute animated smile, the film could have been more than a day of girls' encampment around 1948.
