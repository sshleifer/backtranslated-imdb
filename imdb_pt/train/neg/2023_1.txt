As the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard in an RPG. Did you seriously think they were gay? Are you retarded? If you have been saving your best friend and someone decides, by the kindness of your heart, help you, then you are in serious debt with that man. Lavitz was a good person and every time they helped each other, they approached as friends. They were not gay lovers as their complaint. And for you to know that the game is set in a medieval period of time. At that time, women only cooked meals while the men fought. Do you know your story? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted into the army these days? This game contains a lot of realism, even if you are too slow obviously to catch it, and you really need to quote some solid evidence instead of ignorant assumptions based on your wrong act of interpreting the story.
