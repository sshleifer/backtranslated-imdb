Almost as tedious to watch as it was to read, Evening is a wonderfully produced failure ... until Meryl Streep walks in and silently shows her other cast members how to act in this sort of thing. Vanessa Redgrave is shocking in her role as Ann and Claire Danes, who are dying, is a figure. Maybe if Vanessa and Claire shifted, we could have seen the vibe in the young Ann who gave her entrance into the rarefied world of history and we could have imagined that the older Ann was really dying. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that adding Michael Cunningham to writing credits softened the story, but unfortunately. That gave me a headache.
