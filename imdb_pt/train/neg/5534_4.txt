I'm working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies on set. I'm watching them with my seven-year-old daughter, who makes most of these movies a tumult of laughter. <br /> <br /> I had high hopes of REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, after watching White Zombie, which is really the forerunner of so much that is the basis of the zombies in the cinema (think of Clive's Serpent and Rainbow) Barker, and James Bond's Live and Let Die funeral scene, NOT THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD). <br /> <br /> However, although the title includes the word "zombies", it is little more than a love triangle, involving the anthropologist Armand Louque, in love with Claire Duval; who in turn is taken with his partner Clifford Grayson. What a yawning party, my daughter fell asleep in the middle of the road. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time deciphering who these people worked for - the allies or the axis; but, I guess that does not really matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in credits for this movie; but of course, those were his (White Zombie's) eyes serving as mind control device to the zombies.
