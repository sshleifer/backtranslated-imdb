The only reason I'm bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all the 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought an ex-rental for Â£ 3.00, it sounded interesting, so I took the risk. <br /> <br /> A few minutes after turning it on, I realized that I had made a mistake. The entire cast should be stored until the winter and then thrown into the nearest bonfire where they could find more of their kind. <br /> <br /> As for Devin Hamilton (writer and director), he should be just shot, unfortunately this should have been done before he did this crap. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you see it in the shops get away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
