In a word, this movie was boring. Life and spark were missing. One big problem is with both leads. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever. He was boring and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> The visuals were interesting, but did not improve the scenes. Either way, the visual tended to separate the audience from what was happening on the screen. None of the action sequences seemed real and therefore the film failed to create any drama or sense of danger. The film had potential, but it needed a better script, a better acting and a better director. I was thinking during the movie, you know, this movie would have worked if Harrison Ford were Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical acclaim for this movie. The critics I think are praising the film because they want to * like it and want it to succeed, even if it fails on many different levels.
