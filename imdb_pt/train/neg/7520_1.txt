This movie proves that you can not judge a movie by the stunning art on the cover of the DVD. It also serves to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it (or buy it for someone else at Christmas). The beginning of this movie looks really promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old man on the street) brings to college a book full of witch spells that he leaves in his annual haunted house (where the movie happens). After that there is a bit of soft drink, fight and porn. Then the action of the movie finally happens after more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Overall, Hallow's End was predictable, insensitive, and reminiscent of soft-core pornography. This movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do as it is a good movie to have fun with. And for beginning viewers, it's a lot of fun to make predictions about the order of dying people.
