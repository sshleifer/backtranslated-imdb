A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to a doctor (James Karen) to try to get pregnant. It works, but Adams slowly realizes that there is something seriously wrong with the baby ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting idea is made by a poor script - the basic idea is good, but it becomes frighteningly predictable in relation to the baby. end. I saw every "twist" coming. The direction is bad - he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene. The production values ​​are - to be good - bad. Very poor. And the bloody scenes are very unpleasant (I almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach) with lousy special effects. The movie derails completely at the end, when it becomes clear that they had no idea how to end this movie. <br /> <br /> Good acting makes it a bit bearable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching, but that was about it. This evil film was released in 1991 and still remains unknown - it's easy to see why. I give a 4.
