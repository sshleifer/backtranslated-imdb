Trust me, this is a movie you want to avoid and this comes from a big fan of Denzel Washington. The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a great movie. The first part of this film does an exceptional job of configuring the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he paid to protect. The trailers in this movie mention that she is kidnapped. So I'm not giving anything away when I say that the movie degenerates into an almost untold mess after she's kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he could do was make the audience literally nauseous. Fast, frenzied, agitated cuts go on for the next half hour while Creasy traces the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is get him out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting the story meant a change in Creasy's character and meant that a different film would be next. Well, he was right. The movie that followed was a complete crap and unsatisfactory. The result of this is a depressing ending that destroys even the quality of the first forty minutes of the film.
