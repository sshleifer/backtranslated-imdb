There are bad movies, terrible movies, even boring movies ... I can watch more and put to the end, not this time. Avoid it like pestilence, annoying music everywhere, terrible editing, no comedy, more tacky than a novelty mug ... My mistress wanted to watch this thinking that it would be legally blonde material or something assistive, but never better than the average, girl movie. It was the first time she was begging me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> The girls, well, they were not great to start (Denise did what happened in Star Troops and wild things), but you sank to the gravel. I feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on it ... Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after a lot of construction work on her face. <br /> <br /> Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells complaining about the total mince that is on your screen.
