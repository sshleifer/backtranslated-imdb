I looked up a copy of The Forest because I was watching a VH1 special, I think "Where Are They Now", and saw the video box flashing on the screen during a segment on actor Corky Pigeon. He played the male child ghost in this horrible horror B, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the television show Silver Spoons. This movie is a big disappointment. There's nothing here. In fact, it took me four months to watch from start to finish. I would stop in the boredom, letting go of him and forgetting him, then stumbling on him and trying once more to get past him. Obviously, the angle of this film that was intended to differentiate it from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions. And obviously, here, that does not work. I can not stand the male leads. I kept waiting for them to look at the palms of their hands during the long dialogue scenes in order to read the lines of scam. The situation at the beginning, in which couples decide to go camping separately, is awkward and dumb. I think the only positive thing to say about this is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone coming out of his flesh. It's pretty good makeup there. Dude, I'm actually reaching for a positive now, huh. The only other non-budget horror movie on a level as bad as this would be the Sweet Home Home.
