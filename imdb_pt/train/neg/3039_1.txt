I can always tell when something is going to be a success. I see or hear and I have a good feeling. I did not feel right watching the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this movie, and I'm not at all surprised that it is rated as one of the worst 100 films. Actually, I was right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that took me away was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics (I'm black by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title, and for this time use a title that does not have bad grammar. I heard the dialogue, saw the acting and all I could do was make faces. <br /> <br /> I also think the theme of the dance film is being exaggerated. At least "You Got Served" was better than that in my opinion. Even the soundtrack did not excite me.
