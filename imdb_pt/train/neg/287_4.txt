As an Altman fan, I had been looking for this movie for years, thinking that with such a cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's great cast mishmashes, thrown together at random and improvised (or so it feels) in the hope that everything would fit into the editing room. Do not do. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable only for the premiere performance of Alfre Woodard, who outstrips the veterans around him. But in addition, avoid at all costs. (Which is pretty easy to do - it was never released on video - as far as I know - and his appearances on cable TV have Halley's Comet frequency.)
