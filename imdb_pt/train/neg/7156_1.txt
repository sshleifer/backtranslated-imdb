Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well certainly does after this test of endurance of a movie. How on earth I was able to continue without pressing the fast forward button, you only know. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me !! Maybe I do not have the premise of the movie ... or maybe I do not enjoy the alleged mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, although the film has an atmosphere as mystical as a trip to McDonalds. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were all terrible and there was more character development in a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do this? Why do I watch these guts? It's enough to make a run away and join a monastery or the Foreign Legion !! YAARGH !! An absolutely incredible movie in almost every aspect. Also, not bad.
