A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital where a team of doctors is trying to surgically remove a DVD wrapper from his butt. <br /> <br /> I stopped excited about the prospects of another Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels brought me a lot of entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great, but dude, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First the people who cast the cast must have slept while they were doing it. I imagine the castings were something like that. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I really like fish." "Wonder full, you're hired. Have some money." <br /> <br /> That there is the script. I read Chabon, who I hope has gone blind before he can see this piece of dong, and has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not sure why that bothered me as it happened but it might have something to do with the fact that hearing a speech impaired 90-year-old drunken duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat compared to the one- liners these massacre of 2nd grade model children spitting. <br /> <br /> This is an actual movie line; "If you tell me something you've never said out loud to anyone before, this moment becomes unique!" Single? Do it? This really? Of course not you plank. Please, give me the Imodium. I'll have a whole strip. <br /> <br /> The direction is ... well. I have nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just said his grandmother exploded or something. Stick to direct comedies. Does not stick to driving commercials. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that left me banging my head against the wall so hard that it brought me back to stone age. I give 2 stars because I do not want to be the guy who watched a 1-star movie.
