I usually love lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm biased, I think! <br /> <br /> But this is just the hole. Yes, the scenery and the buildings are beautiful, and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but on the other hand this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between boring and getting stoned / fainting at any drug or beverage is helpful, and Ella inexplicably puts up with this disgusting behavior throughout the film. At no point are we given any clarification as to why this is so, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If there was at least some kind of closure (potentially romantic? I even know!) relationship between the two, there may have been some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at one point ask Ella "why do you love me?" Ella does not even recognize it. It's never really clear if this is anything more than a lesbian (ill-behaved) on a tedious journey with a heterosexual woman. Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey, which could have been lively and informative, is flat, tedious and incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There's a good joke in the movie, though I'm sure it was not intentional. Women travel in a two-seater Ford coupe with a medium-sized trunk. However, when they set up camp, they have a huge tent, cribs, bedding and even a table, chair and typewriter! Also, when boarding a ferry, we see piles of luggage, presumably from them, presumably also carried in the little Ford's briefcase! <br /> <br /> And throughout the movie, we never see a gas station, or anywhere that seems to have some place to buy gas. Mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So where did they get fuel? <br /> <br /> There may not be many lesbian movies out there, good or bad, but there are many who are better than this, and very few who are worse. Leave it in the rack.
