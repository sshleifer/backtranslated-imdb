It is not one of Keaton's best efforts, this was perhaps a veiled attempt to avenge his family in which he married - the Talmadges. A barrier of the Polish / English language and a series of coincidences leads Buster to marry a great Irishman, who (along with his father and siblings) treats him with snobbery until he thinks he can be an heir to a fortune. Wrong identities are plentiful here - gags are created and only for the principal fails to pay. <br /> <br /> This short film has at least two real laughs - Buster is deftly turning his lack of dinner using the wall calendar and the basic ignorance of his adoptive family to literally bring the meat to his plate. The other is a family photo, with the whole group falling slowly to the floor, while the camera tripod loses stability. <br /> <br /> Too much yeast beer may have been the catalyst for a huge series of jokes built. on top of jokes, but stops short (for any buildup) of development. <br /> <br /> Kino's impression is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but worth a few laughs.
