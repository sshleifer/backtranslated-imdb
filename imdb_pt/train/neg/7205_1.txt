If you like to see what must have started as a 2 hour movie in uncontrollable bursts of unwatchability, you will love this movie. Otherwise, you'll just wonder how they could have made such a movie from something as simple to translate to the big screen as the Inspector Gadget. In the previews of the film, many scenes were shown that were not in the film, and within the film, some scenes just do not make sense. While the film is just under 1 1/2 hours, I can only think of a truly memorable moment, and that's before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
