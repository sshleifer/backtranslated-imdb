This one had a great cast with big names like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a lot of less known names with shorter papers. He also had Technicolor, one of the few films made with him in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ....... lamentably, I can not say very positive for the story. He portrayed James' boys in a totally positive way ... and Hollywood has done it ever since. Why these criminals are always shown as the "good guys" is beyond me. This film glamorized them and turned their enemies - the railroad people - into cruel human beings. The latter was so exaggerated that it was absurd. Well, this is the movie world for you: evil is good; good and bad. <br /> Hey Hollywood: Here's the news - James boys were criminals! Really - look up!
