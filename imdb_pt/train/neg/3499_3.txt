Comedy Central was successful with the original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the immensely popular Colbert Report, all comics and professional are all, or in the case of Chapelle Show, were solid shows. Since Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, I was expecting good things when I tuned in. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were some funny sequel problems, but given that the star is Silverman's caliber, the show could have been a lot better. It was just the driver, and we hope the show next week will be better. If not, ask her some help in the form of better writers for the program.
