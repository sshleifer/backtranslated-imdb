Amateurism best describes the cinematic adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "The Celestine Prophecy," which accompanies the spiritual awakening of an unemployed teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Domestic video quality actors feature so-called characters vomiting exaggerated exposure and metaphysical hokum, while the film is driven by the extremely heavy directing of Armand Mastroianni. While there are visible attempts to get interested in more interesting fans of stronger films, in vain, from ABC's "Lost," or Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code," the filmmakers are not up to the task. This movie smells of badly conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda, and the results are so terrible that some can walk through this mess to identify a real point.
