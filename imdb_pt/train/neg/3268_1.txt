It is a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being eaten by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder, but despite all odds, it succeeds. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, exaggerated, but with that comic genius that keeps him laughing even when the mother struggles with the ultimate horror. <br /> <br /> If comedies about children being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this, and yes, it's a weird topic choice for a farce, but really too little of the movie has anything to do with it as it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for his Australian accent and facial contortions. Scrapping media bias and sensationalism and disregarding truth or ethics gives the film a chance to make the boldness that these things are bad.
