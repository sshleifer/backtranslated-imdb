Losing control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre that could be considered as the pulp fiction of the movie world. Generally, they involve an indirect route to a murderous intent, interspersed with copious disembodiments. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by the beautiful women who invariably inhabit this world of lies. Kim Ward (Kira Reed) is suffering a writer block. Just by accident, (or is it?) She meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages her in increasingly risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to divulge any information about himself, but Kim refuses to stop the case. His agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott), thinks he'll do wonders for the sales of his books. As in most movies of this type, the ending comes close to the end, but some things do not add up. I've seen enough of this kind of movie to think, no change there then - but I like them. They are so undemanding. <br /> <br /> The cast presentations vary. Doug Jeffery carries the film as the psychopath / sociopath you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in danger. Clay Greenbush as the PI also did not convince. <br /> <br /> Finally, a note of caution about the DVD under review. Both the cover and the disk state classify the time and the execution time as 93 minutes, but the execution time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes seem truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is stopped as soon as she's starting. 4 stars.
