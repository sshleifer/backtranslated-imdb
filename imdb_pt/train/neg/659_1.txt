This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people get paid to do this rubbish shows that they lack original ideas and talents in the entertainment business. The idea that the public paid to see this movie (and as an idiot that I rented the movie) is also discouraging. <br /> <br /> Professor obsessed (3 years earlier) kills a teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason he kills his mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. Years later, an obsessed professor emerges from prison. HMM - bad writing ever - no one in the town he's terrorized knows until the last minute. Obsessed professor somehow becomes like a SEAL of the Navy and can sneak, sniff people and with a knife is super killer. Right!!! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, messenger knives for fun, and starts hounding teenager friends. Now there's the perfect way to make the girl love you. Obsessed professor runs away from the hotel - again it's stupid, cop would always know his face - but he passes by them. Now he kills two cops outside the teen's house and somehow escapes to her room and kills her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not a single positive thing about this piece of junk. If any other profession did such low-quality jobs, they would be fired. However, these idiots are earning hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and direct this crap.
