This movie was bad. Bad acting, bad direction, poor writing. But it was not bad in a funny way. It was bad in a boring way. I watched "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. It was not. Do not make the mistake I made. There are many nicer ways to spend an hour and a half, like watching dry paint or reading the dictionary. Seriously.
