I had the bad luck to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the last nail in the coffin. Being a devoted fan of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, I was very excited about the film's debut, which only made it even more uncomfortable to watch. I'm usually thrilled with the modern recounts if they are handled well. It is often interesting to see the parallels between past and present within a family history. Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern recount and more of a perversion of pop culture. The characters' adaptation of the original looked youthful and generally proved to be terribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good either. Most of the presentations were ridiculously exaggerated, which I assume was due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script. I did not laugh once the length of the movie. All the jokes were outdated references to events not so current that would surely lose their intensity over time. Actually, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to find Alice, but even so the result was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I would have to say that the conversion of the game of croquet into a rave dance was horrible. It was undoubtedly the low point of the film. What a joke. I do not see this movie. Upon its completion I was genuinely irritated.
