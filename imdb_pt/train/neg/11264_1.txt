I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as "The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen". <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the dishonest details, the low production values ​​and the awful camera work, this movie has absolutely nothing. therefore. I just went to see how I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot in a 2 hour movie. <br /> <br /> The simple answer is - they did not. Characters appear with little or no explanation of who they are, and then play no valuable role in the narrative. Even the main characters act without reason, so that when the movie reaches its climax, you do not care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit in. movies and that it may be unfair to judge this movie against the book from which it was adapted. But after my friends and I left the movie theater, I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what should have happened. <br /> <br /> They even change the true meaning of the book title "Rancid Aluminum". squeezing it into another piece of meaningless voice, only then can they allow the film to have a legal title. <br /> <br /> A real mess of a movie from start to finish.
