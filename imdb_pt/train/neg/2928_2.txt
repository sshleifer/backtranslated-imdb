I really wanted to see this movie, and I waited for months to get through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it appeared in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, which drove me crazy. I'll give any movie a chance, even if I want to leave the theater / press 'stop'. I watched it all the time, but I got nothing but frustration. <br /> <br /> The acting was very, very good, but it was about that. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu gets depressed and comes to some kind of psychiatry, we are never given an insight into his "fall." Although we understand that he and Cedric have separated, again, we do not see this happening or WHY it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he betrayed him once, but it was no big deal. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but no - nothing. We also got the hints that Cedric was the one to bring Mat to the hospital - but again, we do not see that. <br /> <br /> I know some movies are a basis of 'as is', but this movie honestly irritated me. When Pierre, Cedric's ex shows up at the club and starts to trouble, we do not even see his hide or his hair until the end, and it took me a long time to discover that Pierre was the ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds him are completely different. I may even be wrong to say this, it was so confusing. <br /> <br /> The film expects you to know everything and keep up with its disjointed, out of place and confusing rhythm. I can track movies like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other movies that have flashbacks left / right, but the CU has not captured and held the style. At the end of 'Citizen Kane', you know what's going on and find the answer to the main mysteries. CU just leaves you hanging. He has an air of pretension in his presentation "we will not tell you anything, find out for yourself". It's like reading a book with chapters changed and pages missing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, like I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was very disappointing.
