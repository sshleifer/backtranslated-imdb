It's hard to describe this movie and someone wants to try not to discard it too quickly because you have the feeling that this may be the perfect movie for a 12 year old girl ... <br /> <br /> film has a good concept, the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with a twist. There are some pretty dreamy pictures and some beautiful sketches of the boy's relationship with his single mother and his schoolmate ... a good start you can say, but then you got a little greedy, very greedy, he tries to be a science fiction, a drama, a thriller, a possible romantic love story, a fairy tale, a comedy and everything under the sun. The result just left the audience a bit inadequate. For example, the scene in which the girl (played by Risa Goto) finally woke up with her kiss (Yuki Kohara), instead of being romantic, she tries to be scary to make us laugh later ... is a cheap trick because ruined all the anticipation and excitement he was trying to build for the better half of the movie. <br /> <br /> I did not read the original story on which the film is based (it is the best known work). by the comic artist Osamu Tezuka is famous for its intriguing and intricate stories). Did all the problems existing in the original story or occurred in the adaptation? It is quite illogical even for someone who is accustomed to the "complicated logic" of those Japanese comics. For example, how did Yuki Kohara's character get to the hospital in an instant (when it's supposed to be a long bus ride) to get away from Risa Goto's character in front of the TV cameras soon after he saw his interview live? the television? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are copied directly (very uncreative!) from other movies and they all seem a little uselessly annoying. the famous scene "the mouth of the Lion sings my hand" of the "Roman holiday" <br /> <br /> The movie tries to be everything but ends up being nothing ... it is not a fairy tale and did not have enough jokes to be a comedy ... and strangely there are some scenes that look like even an unintentional "ghost" movie. However, one should give credit for capturing some of the Japanese teenager's feelings. <br /> <br /> It is by watching this movie that I get the feeling that there may be some movies that should come with a warning label that said "this movie may only be suitable for people under the age of 18." , would definitely have been in the poster for this movie. <br /> <br />
