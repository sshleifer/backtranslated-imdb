I would have liked to give a zero to this movie, but that was not an option! This movie sucks !!! Women can not act. I should have known I was going to suck when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could believe that I had not changed channels after the first 15 minutes. the idea of ​​black women as gunslingers in the days of the west is ridiculous. it's not just a racing thing, it's also a genre. the combination of the two is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some of the people in the movie are not bad actresses, but the movie itself was awful. was not credible as a movie. can be "fun" for a certain group of people, but I'm not in that group. I laughed a lot. and using a fine line from a great, great movie ... "that's all I have to say about it."
