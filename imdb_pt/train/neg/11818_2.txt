On a distant planet, a psychopath is saved from execution by a monk from outer space. He releases some comrades and leaves prison in a spaceship. They dock in a ridiculously huge spacecraft that orbits a supernova star. This massive ship is populated by only three people, presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to the hiring of many actors. Anyway, to shorten the story, the three goodies end up in a cat-and-mouse game with the villains. <br /> <br /> The psychopath in this movie is curious because it is annoying. 'Irritating' is generally not a term that would be used to describe a lunatic - unbalanced, scary, dangerous, perhaps, but not 'annoying', but he is. The three people who man the giant ship are seriously unconvincing because they guarantee such important roles - this ship is about the size of a city! Considering that the film is scheduled to be about 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a man-made craft can exist, no matter the fact that it is used for a relatively mundane task. Despite the vast size of the spacecraft, all the crew took a chance, tiny rooms and the dining room consist of what looks like a plastic table and chairs. But there are many aisles. <br /> <br /> The film is quite well represented and functions as a science fiction thriller. But nothing great.
