Yes, the only thing that this movie is memorable is that it starred a young Tom Hanks who just a few years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood. But here, it's not a movie that's going to show a lot of his talent, and the only other thing that can be considered a bit of fun in this movie is the scene where he thinks he sees monsters and commands a guy. Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imagination and try to create interesting scenarios. Basically, a kind of school after special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly renamed it here as Labyrinths and Monsters. Apparently the producers of this movie felt that nerds should not have fun of any kind unless they went out to drink underage, drugs, have too much unprotected sex and torment other weaker children as all the popular kids were doing. No, these bad people were playing a game that really required one to use there brain, no heaven! Not that if they have a brain, they really can think for themselves and not brainwash in certain groups. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and a waste of time. Sure, it may be a movie against addiction, but there are far fewer people who have died taking Dungeons and Dragons away in their entire existence than saying what drunk driving in a month.
