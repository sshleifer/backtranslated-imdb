Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired car thief who is forced to return to the "game" when his younger brother faces death by not filling an order for British crime boss Raymond Calitri. The work involves "raising" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will promulgate his punishment. So, Raines quickly assembles a team he can rely on and sets the task to be performed. But the police are attached to it and some of the cars on the list are not easy. It seems almost impossible to complete. The cast of Gone In 60 Seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. All that deserve better. Enough active power there to power a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is that this is a case of many overloaded cars in the parking lot, many characters, and there is enough enthusiasm. From the outset, we have no doubt that it is a production of Bruckheimer / Simpson, a crazy script full of loud noises and cheese, shotgun editing and subtly driven by Dominic Sena. It is essentially a big budget remake of H.B. The Halicki indie film of 1974, with the same name, with the premise offering the potential for an adrenaline-fueled car movie. Potential that, unfortunately, is never realized. There are one or two moments of high impact, certainly, but nevertheless, pleasant. But if you forgive the pun, the movie never gets out of the first gear, it's more than happy to work with your team of characters who love trying to make the coarse script {Scott Rosenberg} work. <br /> <br /> Car fans will get something from it (cars are ace in the eye), as well as fans of unintentional comedy movies (see Ecclestone's Carpenter's Sadness moment). But no, it's really very poor. 4/10
