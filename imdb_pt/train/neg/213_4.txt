Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A biangle love, (sorry for the poetic license, but it is not a triangle!) An interesting story, unfortunately ill-told. The image is sometimes strange, sometimes OK, the image seems overcrowded and narrow. Sound needs more attention (usually in Romanian films), light and color filters are sometimes poorly chosen. The soundtrack is short and not helping the action. About acting ... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immature and can not convince the viewer. The acting is poetic when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetic. It's an adult photo, told by children. Bother yourself only if you are extremely curious.
