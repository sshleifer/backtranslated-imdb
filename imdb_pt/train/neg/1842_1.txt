This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to sign up after watching this movie. I can not, in good conscience, allow this film not to be reviewed by me. People should be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken, and yet, I hated this movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there is no script. The dialogue is unreal and simple, the situations are planned, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are unfriendly and uninteresting, and the story, although based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poop. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about wasting MONEY on this movie, nor is it worth spending your time watching. Please, I do not see this ... I beg you!
