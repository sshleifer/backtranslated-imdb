Identical twin sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, achieved fame on shows like "Two of a Kind", I had never seen them in anything before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically, sisters Hunter Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a Summer Internship Program, but not long after they start their jobs, they are immediately fired by a series of setbacks. But the owner of the company they work for, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them back their jobs, and they slowly prove themselves to be useful assets, and talented (fashionable) artists, and help prevent an evil man from taking over. the company. Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can tell that this movie was made to go straight to the video, the camera work is completely incompatible, and does not help when you want to admire the views of Rome. In fact, the background is the only good thing to see, the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities in the world, I knew before seeing that they would not interest me at all (they are not pretty), this is horrible waste of garbage film. Very poor!
