"Lies" talks about a case between an 18-year-old girl and a married man of 38 with the pair of protags spending about half the time on the screen engaging in naked sex and whipping and the other half wandering through the pathetically naive plot that seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes. With a very poor production value, including obvious sanitary appliances and fake softcore sex for a story that is a confused mix of comedy and drama, "Lies" quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam. With nearly two hours of running, subtitles and so little substance, "Lies" is simply not recommended. (W-)
