Disappointing and annoying. The writer does not have a true understanding of human nature, but, on the contrary, unites the clich√©s in a disjointed way. The character is not explored in depth. These are puppets placed in a plot that he openly confesses that he needed a dramatic element, the case of the mother with the lover of his daughter. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid excels, despite having some peculiar situations and lines, such as staying passively to allow her irritated daughter to slap her eyes. The screenplay portrays Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde with no clues as to why, except that he coke cocaine before the big scene. <br /> <br /> A mature writer could have done a lot more with that topic.
