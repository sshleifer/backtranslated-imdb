Slowly, slowly, slowly ... There is no mystery or excitement in this movie. If you do not find out who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes, you must be brain-dead. The secret service must also have been because it took the whole film to put it together. There are no convincing characters in the film (not film). The pace of the film is slow, there is no tension. The hired killer is an excellent shot, unless he's aiming at Michael Douglas, than all he seems to be capable of attaining are large glass panels. The funniest scene in the movie is when the president's wife says the code word in the anticclimatic ending. It's a ridiculous laugh. At least six people got up and left the movie earlier. I would have joined them if I had not been sitting in the middle of the row. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
