I did not like this movie. On the one hand, I found him coarse and vulgar for no reason. I also felt that it is misogynist (against women). Also, the movie does not really seem to be about anything, and I did not find any of the characters friendly. Really, there does not seem to be any point at all. Maybe I'm missing out on something, but for me, this movie is pretty much a waste of time, when I could be doing something more productive and enjoyable. How to use my face like a pincushion. James Garner is in this thing, as well as C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell. Everyone is wasted here, and I'm sure that was a low point in each of their respective careers. Jennifer Harrison (from the last years of Three's Company) is also in the movie, and it's good to see her in a non-servile role. But in addition, it can rise above the mediocre script. For me, Tank is a 3/10
