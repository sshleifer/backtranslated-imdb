Warning: Contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene, then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This confirms the motto above. The second scene constitutes the center of rotation of all action. The fact that we know the ending makes the movie boring. Even more, other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. And this became more frustrated. To compensate for the consequent lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how the characters are unbalanced. And oh yes, they have so much to show. Andy (P. Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more?, He is betraying his wife, more?, He plans to rob his father, more?, His wife is cheating on his brother, more? He does not I regret your complicity with your mother's death, more?, He's a serial killer, more? etc etc is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how he could have a superior job. And why his wife had not left him before. On the other hand I really like the performances of actor Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here the PSH saves what's left of my $ 7 spent for this absurdity. Why absurd? Because it does not make sense, why should I care about the despicable characters? Another broken motto is that a movie should have a nice (at least nice) character. <br /> <br /> It is also very sentimental, for example, we must take care of the suffering of the widowed father without knowing anything about the lives of the parents before the crime.
