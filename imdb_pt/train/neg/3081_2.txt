Good suffering! Although I still assert that Hands: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, Hobgoblins came very close. This ... thing ... insults the public at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least movies like Space Mutiny and Future War can be tanned on mst3k, this was an effort to get through. I was literally squirming on the couch in anguish. It was able to embarrass me - alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you are a diehard MST3K fan and have fulfilled your mission of seeing all the experiments, think twice before you see this one. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
