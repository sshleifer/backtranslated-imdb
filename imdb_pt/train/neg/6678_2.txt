This is a copy of the classic Doris Day of 1948, Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less the same, but it is contemporary. Govinda plays an insightful guy who replaces her husband on the trip. While Rani plays the college friend who does the same thing to her. They apparently try to catch each other while the husband and wife try to run over each other in Bombay. <br /> <br /> On the way, Govinda confuses another girl with Sanjiv's wife and spies her while falling in love with her. the rapturous Rani. <br /> <br /> Lever plays a double role as father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are placed against each other for the couple at war. <br /> <br /> It is a terrible attempt to copy the original classics and the songs are quite scary. The comedy is a slap and it will not make you laugh too much.
