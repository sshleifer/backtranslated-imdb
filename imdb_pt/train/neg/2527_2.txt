This movie was full of endless surprises! Just when you thought it could not get any worse, they added more joints and more pink-lined vans with bold sex scenes. As you can imagine, I was a victim of the original version. We were fooled into watching it thinking it was Supervan, the host box that promised lasars, prison breaks, and more. Who would have thought that a Christmas gift from the Dollar Store could have been so much fun!
