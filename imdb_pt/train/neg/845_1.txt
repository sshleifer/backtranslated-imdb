Too bad you can not vote for zero stars on IMDb, because I would not have hesitated! In fact, I would say that this movie was in the negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie thinking that by having Michael Madsen, it could be good ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine the length of a movie "The Brave and the Beautiful," well, the Primal Instinct did not even come close to that, and I had thought there would be nothing worse than a movie "The Bold and the Beautiful." <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how could you do this to us? The worst part is that I did not go any further, I was hoping that in the end they would reveal that it was some kind of bad joke, that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad movie. Where do I start ...? Direction - Stars Zero, Script - Stars Zero, Acting - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Half Star, Graphic Design - Half Star, DVD Menu - Half Star. <br /> <br /> However, I think it's very important to have seen bad movies just so you know what a really bad movie is. That's why I'm happy to have seen this movie, only to have a bad movie to put at the end of my list.
