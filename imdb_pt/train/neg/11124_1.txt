I usually do not care much about violence in movies, or with a lot of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All of this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of what was said to us. There are beautiful pictures especially of the lake and nature, a good scene of characters, a good direction. This movie could be voted as a good movie. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and both reasons in regards to making this movie simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is violence used against living creatures to make this movie. It's not violence in the movies, I'm talking about REAL violence. Only this violence could be justified, if not, and that is reason number two; the film's message was not mere insight into the distorted relationship of directors to women. Not that we all do not get some twists on women (men respectively). But ending the movie spoils everything. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "heroine" finally dies, (here by myself, if I remember correctly, I saw this movie years ago and it infuriated me, now the guy is out with a new movie that I am certainly not going to watch) and is now even more clearly depicted as a kind of natural, nature-booming demon about her, particularly her sex. Of course it's the director who "kills" the female heroine. Women have to die, especially if men are attracted to their sexuality. This seems to be the final conclusion. Well, well, all that might be good for me if the director had kept his vision to himself. But to use great figures, the cruelty of artistic directions to living creatures, only to say that men may be afraid of women, and men are cruel to women. That's not enough. I knew that when I saw this movie, it would reach good critics for the "philosophical, oriental and artistic" and any approach. But for me this movie is totally totally undermined.
