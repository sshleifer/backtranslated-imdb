I'm sure the people on the Texas-Louisiana border must have had a good laugh or two when Paramount's B unit inflicted it on the war public. Quite simply the area along the Sabine River where the film opens is a cotton country, as well as the rest of the deep south, or at least the deep south was post Civl War. There are no major cattle empires there, they are far west in Texas, more than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could set up their empire. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the two partners on a river boat. and when Leo Carrillo attempts a robbery of his services, not paying them for transporting his cattle, they keep the cattle. And that's the beginning of the great Ponderosa ranch they start. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Foster marries Dix's sister, played by Frances Gifford, and fights with their much smaller neighbors. They also have some more problems with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> Either way, we Easterners who like the Western, generally do not care about geographic trifles and it's still a good western from the Harry Sherman factory that produced it all. those westerns from Hopalong Cassidy to Paramount. The climax is a fiery, and I mean, literally, the shooting that should have been used in a production of A. But I would have none, but the western fans look at it.
