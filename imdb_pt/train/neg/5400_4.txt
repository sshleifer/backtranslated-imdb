This is just a bit of a full festival based on a Stephen King story. Two tabloid reporters, one experienced (Miguel Ferrer) and one not so successful (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) can be a vampire. Stranger than strange is that this sucker of modern blood does not make his way naturally, but by means of a black Cessna he seeks out his victims. The gore really gets horrible when the movie nears the stupid end. Keep in mind that Mr. King had nothing to do with this movie. I'll admit it's a bit scary in the early hours of the night.
