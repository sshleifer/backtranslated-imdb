so ... it's really sexist and classist, and I thought it might not be in the early stages of the movie, like when Stella tells Steven that she really would like to switch and start talking the right way and he says she does not change. well, it certainly changed tone, and it seems the other reviewers followed suit. What at first seems to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the film does not make her a hero, leaves the whole thing sad. and it's sad that people think that makes her a hero. maybe that's the movie commentary that people should take. positive reception reflects ongoing patriarchal currents in social consciousness. disgusting.
