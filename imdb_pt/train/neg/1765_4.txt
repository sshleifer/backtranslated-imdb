OK - the helicopter shots are fantastic, and the director made good use of some of Barcelona's top attractions. Otherwise ... the production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the movie sounded like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and amusing to behold, Abel Folk was deeper and more effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He was able to put his martial arts training to good use and be a sincere action figure. The rest of the cast was wood at best, but mostly paper. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's a postcard with a touch of action and a good dose of El Greco. If not, skip.
