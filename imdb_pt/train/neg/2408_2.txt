This movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead. He first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by. His brother then infects the other members of the gang. In some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run very fast which makes little sense. The acting is mediocre, but the story does not help the film. The makeup consists of blood on the face of zombies. The budget for this movie, I'm sure, was very limited. I believe the film could have been better done if the story was more original and with a better budget. If you do not want to see a good zombie movie, do not watch this one.
