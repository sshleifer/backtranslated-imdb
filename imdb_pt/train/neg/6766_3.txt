Have you probably heard that phrase when you first came to this movie? "Herbie: Fully Loaded with Crap" and yes, that's true. This movie is really horrible and totally lame. <br /> <br /> This must be the second worst film Lindsey has ever done since the Teen Confession in Drama. The only good thing about this movie seems to be the talent cast, which by far is better than the movie millions of times and is the only selling point of the movie. I do not see how such a respected actor as Matt Dillon could be a part of this movie, did not he read that awful script before signing to take part? <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this movie is also based on how Herbie is surreal and fancy as extraordinary skill and climb on the wall and go faster than a racing car, after all it's just a Beatle. I know it's a kid's movie, but they've gone overboard with it and it turns out to be dumber than fun. Little realism is needed, but history is predictable. eur-lex.europa.eu eur-lex.europa.eu /> Undoubtedly children are 5 or 12 years old and I doubt anyone can enjoy this foolish movie. What a waste of my money. I feel like cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 (rating: F)
