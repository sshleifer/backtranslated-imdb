One of them, "Why was this done?" movies. The novel is very difficult to swallow. It's one of those novels that suddenly "click" - they're in love. The movie is full of long breaks and uncomfortable moments - the drive-in restaurant is the most notable. Charles Grodin does a credible job, but for most of the film it's just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself: Do you want to see Grodin with your neurosis and Lasser with your neurosis together for an hour and a half?
