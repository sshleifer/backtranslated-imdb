In the editing of the miniseries of the Tower of Babel, the narrator describes the builders of the tower as "the descendants of Moses." <br /> <br /> It is like saying that George Washington lived many centuries before Alexander the Great. or that the lamp was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the archery. <br /> <br /> Do I need to say more? The writers of the Great Heroes of the Bible should have at least paid more attention to the chronologies of biblical people and events.
