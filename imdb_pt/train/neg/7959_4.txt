Andy Lau stars another tale disguised as a cop. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who is working for the police and is also near the top of a drug gang (Lau). The movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug arrest just to watch it crumble. Then we are introduced to the young mother addicted to drugs and her daughter who lives near Nick and his friends and police, and 45 minutes later I close the film and post the news. Well represented and great to see this is as uninviting as a movie I've seen in a long time. Not bad as such, it's just you really do not care. I mean, I really do not care. I actually started doing something else completely forgetting that I had a movie with subtitles, that's how much I did not care. I wish I had hated the movie, but the movie is something that almost made no impression on me (it's not even something I could sleep in, it's just something to be ignored). Come in the box called the Chinese Scarface, what after he was dead? This is one to avoid.
