As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and also gore, I found that Nekeddo Burdock sounded pretty good. I researched the plot, read reviews, and even looked at some photos to make sure it looked like a good bloody and scary movie to watch before downloading it. So excited had I finished and ready to be scared and retreating in horror at the amazing gore I was hoping I was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and made no sense and left very unexplained, the blood was hilarious and then horrifying, and what about the sound effects of the cartoon style? The acting was probably the only slightly scary thing about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus and how the mother's husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a bright light, they left both very inexplicable, or maybe I lost, because my mind could not understand what I was really seeing I appreciate the way it should be; shocking and some scenes (the odd cannibalism and the mother kissing herself?) certainly were, I just think they went a little far and not even in a horrible way, they managed not to convince what made it more believable to be a comedy than a horror in my opinion. However it is a very entertaining movie and I have a lot of laughs out of me and a couple of friends but unfortunately we were expecting horror not comedy so it is worth a watch for entertainment value but do not expect a dark, deep scary and creepy movie; you will be disappointed. If this was a horror / spoof comedy I would probably rate about nine, the climax was the strange scene when the husband climbed into his wife's stomach and closed his wounds, but as a horror, unfortunately, I gave one.
