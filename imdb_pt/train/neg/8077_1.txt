I saw this movie a long time ago ... thankfully it was free. I have to be one of maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater. I do not remember a lot of this, but I remember being incredibly bored, the plot made no sense and when I left the theater the only thing I could say was at least now I know what the worst movie I've ever seen was. I was incredibly uncomfortable with one thing: if they can get the temperature nearer to the sun enough for humans to survive, why can not they lower their temperature to a comfortable temperature instead of getting hot and sweaty? How stupid do they think we are?
