I rented this movie today because it sounded like a fun movie. I realized that you really could not go wrong with an ex-girlfriend concept with super powers. <br /> <br /> ... but the movie was confusing and nonsensical ... <br /> <br /> it seemed that every time the writer kept throwing trash. lots of bathroom humor and sexual situations that only a teenager could love. <br /> <br /> It seems like it could have been so simple to take a story from the Fatal Attraction Superhero ... but I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun romantic comedy that was advertised to be. You could not take a child to see her and you'd be embarrassed to see a date. <br /> <br /> If the writer could have made a basic story around the concept high and clean - the film may have a fighting chance. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
