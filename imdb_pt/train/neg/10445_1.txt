This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script is pathetic, and the bigger question is how this low-level script came down to the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies, from deep dramas to the most masculine ones, they kill everything you see, so I can not say I'm picky. I've struggled to find something to compare but I just can not think of anything that matches this, maybe stellar troops. 2. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and I think of playing my DVD player, but compared to this, its effects are great. Superb performance and script must be awarded. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well folks this is not one of those that kills your soul minute by minute.
