If you have a lot of time to lose ... fine. He moves at a good pace, but to get this movie, he needs to be a bit longer with a bit more background on the nanny. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Mariana Klaveno as the nanny does the best job and is the most believable. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a very good role as the husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, like the wife, had a weak part and the reasons for her to return to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The ending is kind of silly. Like most of these sitter movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but overall leaves you wondering why you passed the time.
