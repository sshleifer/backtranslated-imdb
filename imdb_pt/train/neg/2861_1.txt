I can not believe I lost my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and it never got any better. The acting, the music muffling the actors. Horrible. Save your money! You have to read the movie all the time they knew the song would drown the lines of speech. I never received the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being slaughtered. What does this have to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors in this movie. The script would have pushed me away on the first page of the reading. You'd better watch dry paint.
