I first saw the live musical in downtown Denver for the performing arts and it was absolutely mind-boggling, stunning and had such a fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I enjoyed it a lot more than most of the musicals I've seen on stage. The interesting thing is that you have never seen Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of all production. When I heard they were making a movie, I waited anxiously, but when I watched the movie version I was so disappointed that I felt like I was being cheated. The movie does not have the catchy mood set in live production and never allows you to be completely in touch with all the characters. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and if this were to revive, I would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
