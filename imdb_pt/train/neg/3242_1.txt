Here is a comment for people like me. This movie sucks from start to finish. I threw popcorn on the screen and resorted to entertaining the MSF2000. The plot depends on events of chance and depends on the stupidity of people who should be smart. The leadership falls in love with a con man and does not occur to him that she can be deceived ????? And is she rich ??? And she is a famous psychologist ????? Come on guys. Does she enter the bar only at the most convenient time, when everyone is gathered to talk about it? This was so staged that it seemed like a slap in the face even for moviegoers. The rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet's dialogue with the kind of passion some people have for meat eaters, war starters and fur users. My hate is so complete it defies logic. But I will try. That should not sound real is good. I dont care. It's just that everyone says the same thing. Mamet can not create characters; all he can do is to impose his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. No wonder your actors are so wooden. They are confused about everyone being the same character. (However, his latest films improve.)
