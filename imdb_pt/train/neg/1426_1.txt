One question: why? First, the premise is not funny or engaging. They use recorded interviews and take the audio to animate the animals by talking the parts. First of all, the interviews are not funny or fun to start with, and even if they were, I'm sure they would be a lot more fun to be seen as they were originally without being made into cartoons. How does that add some joy to it? I called CBS's Monday night comedy series, (which became a regular way for me to relax after stressful workdays on Monday) and found this. Of course the sitcom's programming would be reruns anyway, being summer, but seeing those episodes again would have been more fun. I tried to give CC a chance. I really did. When it started, I figured, well, maybe it's funny. No. And then he continued. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there was a purpose if the interviews were shown in full and had points for them. But no, they were just one-line clips, cut and glued together very fast. It was like a horrible horrible version of Cartoon Network's "Robot Chicken." I was not a fan of the sitcom "The Class", now canceled by CBS. In the meantime, I was half an hour from the line-up I would fight for. But if I decided a whole season of this or three other episodes of "Creatures" ... let's say I'd get the "Class". Considering it's been a few hours since it aired, and I come here to see that I'm the first to comment ... I think it's a good sign that no one watched, and that it will not last much longer. Cartoon run-down.
