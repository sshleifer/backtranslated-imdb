I'm rarely moved to make an online comment about a movie. But I can not understand how this was done. Who made this? How could they have thought they were capable of making a movie? Did they take a weekend course at some film school, got a good check from Dad, and kidnapped David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to take part? Or did he happen to be a long-time friend of the distant family / relative doing this out of pure and ill-placed kindness? I do not care, I do not care. Even he seems completely ashamed to be in it, murmuring his lines and hiding his face from the camera. In the meantime, the PDO must have been the Neighbours swindler, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, script, direction, and editing were abysmal, and frankly the apathy that dominates me now means I can not be bothered to go beyond my life thinking about this movie.
