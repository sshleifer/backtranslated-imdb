When evaluating documentaries that focus on a relatively small group of far right and conservative Ugly groups like this one in the US, you should consider the following. The United States, with a population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to defend Human Rights, have their shortcomings and disadvantages. Of course extreme right-wing groups and ultra-conservative groups are expected to exist in considerable numbers, but in relation to the size of their population they are very small and isolated. On a per capita basis, Europe, Britain, and even Australia have similar right groups, in fact on a per capita basis. The real size of neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually larger than in the United States of America. It is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to downplay and vilify the American people and their level of debate in the Educated American Society by presenting in a very fraudulent and deceptive way this bunch of extreme right-wing psychopaths as representative of the American Society. In doing so, Greenstreet deliberately chose small, isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of America that is a scandalous and deliberate sensationalist lie. This film is clearly designed to ignite and give in to the views of the people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the American people and the lifestyle under the guise of the ideology of the spiritist and ideological ideal of clich√©. This film was made for profit not to deepen the truth about American society and the human condition. Greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra-right conspiracies, the military industry complex, but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate, not to mention alternative solutions to the failures of a vibrant democracy. Movie Show is exposed as Anti American for their support of this junk. SENSATIONALISM at its worst anti-US trash shameful.
