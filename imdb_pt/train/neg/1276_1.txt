This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Let me say it again: THIS IS THE ONLY WORST MOVIE I SEEN. <br /> <br /> He had all the marks of a bad movie: continuity errors, poor writing, bad acting, poor production value. , Bad music. I thought there were some points for horror movies. The first is that it's supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you. This movie gets F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens to him, we should care. This movie gets an F on that too. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman is attacked by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her. The next story, an OCD guy dies of not being careful and talks to a friend of his dead. Oh, and then there is the horrible and unpleasant story of a bad roommate. Come on, could you choose topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house, being anal retentive and having a roommate? It happens all these stories where hallucinations, virtual reality induced by a doctor that in turn, is used. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain one thing, I like to watch bad horror movies and laugh at how bad they are. I could not do this with this. It was an absolute pain to sit and watch. Do not under any circumstances watch this movie. You'll regret it.
