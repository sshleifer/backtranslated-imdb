Ostensibly this is a Z-grade DTV horror film. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I have, many times" <br /> /> /> <br /> <br /> "Why are you reading this book?" "Because it makes the plot more interesting" <br /> <br /> <br /> "You made your way here, now you can make your way again!" (after he takes a man to the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listen to what they sing) <br /> <br /> - it's not so clear what this movie, made at the time known for post-structuralism, it's really about, or if it's just a bad movie. The acting is atrocious, but some actors I know, so they're faking it? <br /> <br /> An old house, obviously cut with a contemporary residence, is the site of the murders. A movie (bad) is made on the spot and the story is repeated again.
