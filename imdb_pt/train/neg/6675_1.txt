This weekend just passed I watched "28 Weeks Later" which was very good. After that, I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's one of the most annoying you've ever seen. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no script or plot. The alien creature was unreal. And the fight scenes are light compared to a fight in the schoolyard. And to make matters worse, the guy named Cody had a loose, uncontrollable tongue that distracted the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie; I'd rather go watch 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Mesake C.
