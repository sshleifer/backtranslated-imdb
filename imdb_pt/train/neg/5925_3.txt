Is this the "worst" episode of Star Trek TOS? Maybe at least get my vote as being in the bottom 5. I mean, this episode makes absolutely no sense. Seeing something that makes you crazy? Give me some time. This episode also has a different feel, the music is increased, almost forced to improve the sense of anguish, to the point of being a drug. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, superior beings like the Triskelion or anything other than Medusin, these are very boring aliens to make an episode out there. McCoy begins to utter his famous line, "He's dead, Jim." Spock puts on the goggles while transporting the ambassador although Kirk does not. They go through that damn "barrier" now for the third time I remember, boring. At least the upcoming episodes of Season Three would be "Specter of the Gun" and "Day of the Dove" and others to follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication, where would pick people like me as avid fans. Personal remarks, Trek liked to wear purple, his kind of a pinkish purple, like when they are in the corridor outside the compartment, the corridor that is usually gray is now purple. We've never had a purple bridge, but it's interesting to see, I noticed this in several episodes, it was done by a light filter and it works great, but in this episode, the ship aisle is pretty lame.
