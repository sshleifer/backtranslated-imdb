I sat in this movie tonight, forcing myself to stay with him even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two protagonists, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were great movie stars of their day and I wanted to see them in "something different," which certainly was. Both gave great performances, but of unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is about a small town in Mexico inhabited by characters almost uniformly unpleasant (the doctor, of course, is the big exception). . What Michèle Morgan sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think of was that if Sartre's work resembles this film, it must be a very mediocre attempt to mimic Camus's masterful novel, The Plague, which treated a plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> Well-acted but uninteresting movie.
