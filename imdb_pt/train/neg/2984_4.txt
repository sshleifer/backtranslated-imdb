I admit that most of this movie was uninspired, but I was still entertained. It has a wonderful feeling of frantic energy, above average music, and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves, there are no bargains here. I can think of dozens of other movies that were much worse, at least this one had an intriguing plot along with some social commentary. They allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics, they destroy everything in sight, even if it means the people you are. Martial law can be dangerous, because at that point democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to try to combine his previous work (zombie, beyond, gates of hell) in an effort to somehow improve on them. He failed, but definitely not miserably, as a number of people would like you to think. I have a weakness for zombie movies, so I'll admit I'm a bit biased when it comes to reviewing them. All I'm saying is that this movie is good for once, if there was not so much downfall in the production of this movie (fulci come out and bruno (I can hack with the best of them) mattei took over) could have been much better and more focused. It will stay in my collection as fulci's zombie swan song. An amazing note is that there is a zombie 3 scene that the man from the cemetery really stole, I could not believe myself, check it out you will be amazed.
