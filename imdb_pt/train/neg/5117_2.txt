I want to declare first that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television industry), so I understand what it's like to work on a feature film so that the filmmakers will support it. I am in favor of positive and uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things do not always work ... even for the followers of Christ). I am glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the Christian message; for me, it was just the execution where the movie fell on his face. A movie lives and dies in its history and here you have one-dimensional stereotypes, large exposure and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are, inexplicably, at a minimum. I believe a movie does not have to hit your head with your message to show the point. I'm sure the Kendrick brothers. will improve over time and their methods of storytelling as well. Maybe they could direct someone else's script as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not exactly my first love, but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.) can inspire in many ways. If you're interested in a cult-inspiring movie, take a look at Steven Soderbergh's 'King of the Hill'. All truth is the truth of God ...
