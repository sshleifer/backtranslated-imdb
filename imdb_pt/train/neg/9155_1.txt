This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like a "homework" for a movie class. It is totally wrong when it comes to the "message" you are trying to convey. Characters are more exaggerated, bad acting and as by a plot ... well, it's absolutely ridiculous. The cover photo is what made me think it might be a decent movie, the co-actor is beautiful and that's about it. Moral of this film: NEVER JUDGE A MOVIE THROUGH THIS DRUM! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movie and you'll be way better than me. It was painful to watch and frankly, I'm surprised someone would spend money to make and distribute!
