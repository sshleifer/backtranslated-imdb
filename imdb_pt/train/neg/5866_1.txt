I remember this movie when I was 13 years old (it seems like a lot of critics are saying the same thing about 13!) With a group of friends from school. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in her first movie, and we fell in love with the typical commercial ads telling us it was a great comedy. We suffered about 45 minutes and everyone agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque and tasteless, and far from Billy Crystal's ability to make us laugh, we were not laughing. I came across this comment by accident, and decided to just register to tell the rest of the world what rot-gut film waste this was, now if you rent this, you deserve what you receive, you've been warned!
