SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why Pete did not help save Williams' life, I mean it would be great to know why William was motivated or forced. I think members of the Secret Service are ordinary people, and there is a rumor that the writer was a member of the Secret Service, now it's motives are clear, well known. But as a rental this movie will not satisfy you, because the old twists, but used, the average acting-these are just things in this movie, just to keep you wait for the end.Clark Johnson as the SWAT director worked so much better this time around, and still wonder how the producers (eg, Michael Douglas) have left this movie to theaters.
