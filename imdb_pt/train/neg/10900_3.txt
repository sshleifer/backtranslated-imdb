You can not hold on too much against this knowing it was done in four days, and I hoped it would be overdone anyway. (Not all that overdone in reality.) With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays half way, Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story pays attention, what kind of shocked me; I assumed that the whole purpose of these ultra-low budget horror movies was to cater to the most basic sexual fantasies and not give a shit about the story, but they used many words like "technological" and "physicality" in the script to get their point through. (Although it is possible that the story is important just to explain why there are so few cast members.) Nobody cares about this stupid plot, and the only interesting things in the movie are the mockery of gentle cults and homoeroticisms. so nervous). I would have liked it more if there were just a few random killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with TV quality appearance and acting level. There are some sexy scenes that are okay - boys squirming in bed in their boxers, feeling up; or being tied up and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured over them - and some of them are kind of funny. And I enjoyed the excavations of L. Ron Hubbard and the pretense irony of a story about religious cultists told in intense gay tones, but still not good. 3/10
