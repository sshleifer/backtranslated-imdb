Having seen three other versions of the same film, I'm afraid that this is by far the weakest, mainly due to Scott's tedious and cumbersome performance. His emotions are so soft that they make it difficult to get involved in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was in his worst state, you do not understand that Scott is telling the dialogue with great conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis, he is not convincing either. I can not think of any actors in this movie that match those of the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) assume that and are best performed. Very disappointing.
