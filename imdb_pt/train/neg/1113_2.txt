Hopalong Cassidy with a horse that is not white and is not called a Topper? Go figure! <br /> <br /> This farce does a gross injustice to the greatest of all the heroes of the cowboy, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young versus old, blond hair versus white hair and kills people against throwing the gun out of his hands. Will the true Hopalong please stand up! <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies ever made and, believe it or not, the person who brought us the saga Grandpa!
