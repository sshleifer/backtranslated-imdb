Please save your money and go see something else. This movie was a piece of crap. I did not want to go, but I had to so I thought I would laugh at least once, NOPE. not a laugh, it was horrible! chris kattan will never have a good comedy role after that and "one night in roxbury". this film is completely obvious, has no clever humor, and only repeats itself over and over again. listen to me and stay as far away from this movie as possible!
