I was flipping through the Richard Burton movie list when I got to this title, which I vividly remember when I first saw it in 1982. I remember Tatum O'Neal's dialogue, which was incredibly bad. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so hopelessly lost, and then remembering how his motivations did not translate for me. In short, I remember "Circle of Two" because it was so phenomenally horrible. <br /> <br /> This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with sickly or distorted angles in adolescents. sexuality. Recall "The Blue Lagoon" (and other annoyances of Brooke Shields), "Lipstick," "Little Darlings," "Beau Pere," and other movies that seemed to insist on teenagers having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager, at this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 1970s and 1980s, made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to discover everything, so to speak. "Circle of Two" is not deplorable or unnecessarily like "Blue Lagoon." In fact, he addresses the issue of love between the young and the old in a courageous, though utterly bankrupt, way. honestly, it's one of those movies you'll never see if you did not see it on your first run, because it was really horrible. No one would like to have this trash to be publicly distributed again.
