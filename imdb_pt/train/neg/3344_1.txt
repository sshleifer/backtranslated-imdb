I should start by stating that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The man reveals some of the funniest cliches of action imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler even though there is nothing like a Dolph spoiler, since the scripts are so absurd: a chase scene with a poor kid carrying a pistol against a guy in a Harley with a submachine gun, through a high school hallway and the boy wins Good game, Oscar goes to Detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for laughing, old friend. <br /> <br /> In summary: Fantastic movie that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends to this and forcing them to sit through it. Hilarious.
