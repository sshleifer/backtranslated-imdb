TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the United States in the 1920s during the filming of the first version of DeMille's 10 Commandments and which is awakened when DeMille's scenarios are dug up in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is whether the filmmakers were serious or joking when they made this film? If this is serious, it's a ridiculously bad movie and a great movie to get along with. If it's a comedy it's less good but funny for all the wrong reasons. You'll laugh hard and hard in this movie, probably more than many other Hollywood "comedies."
