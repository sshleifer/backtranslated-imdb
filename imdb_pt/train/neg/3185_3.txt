This movie was only intercepted by MST3K and for good reason. Firstly, because it's a "cop" movie, starring Joe Don Baker, that we all know is about as good an actor as Michael Jackson is a western country singer. <br /> <br /> The whole plot of the typical film of the police film the devices create their ugly heads, bar fights, children hostages in shootings, bad acting, lame police chiefs, bad acting, revenge / justice, endless henchmen and , of course, bad acting. Do not watch this without an MST3K filter staff.
