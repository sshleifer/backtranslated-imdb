As you all know, JIGSAW did not go to Blackbuster because of a Full Moon team member, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one selling for all video chains. Recently, he released a movie, BLEED, which was selling to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to accept any JIGSAW and double the number of BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop, and BLEED looks like a success. The biggest problem is that BLEED is one of the worst films of all time and, as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I ask everyone to come to the BLEED website and vote on the film that has damaged JIGSAW and all its talents. Likewise, you should go to the JIGSAW page and vote tall for it (if you have not already). We need to put JIGSAW at least 8 or 8.5, and BLEED around 2 (putting it on the list of the 100 worst movie listings on the internet). Also, try to convince friends and family to do the same. <br /> <br /> I hope you're doing well, - Matt
