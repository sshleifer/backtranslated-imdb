I gave this movie a single star just because it was impossible to give less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula to replicate any organism. In their lab (a warehouse in LA), they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies invade the formula and the rest of the film is an endless pursuit. <br /> <br /> Of course, the T-Rex (a rubber marionette) loosens itself and begins to destroy melt. It has the incredible ability to sneak inside 2 or 3 feet of someone without them realizing it and then promptly bites the head. <br /> <br /> A cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film heading aimlessly through the city. She is of such superior mental capacity that she can not even operate the radio. She never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and looks hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> T-Rex wreaks havoc throughout the city, there are armed battles in flames and blown-up (cardboard mock-ups) buildings, but a single police car, or the army, and no one else appears . This activity should be common in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that a continuation will not be planned.
