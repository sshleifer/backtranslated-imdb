A handful of non-professional actors are terrified by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of stop-motion animation, but how do you want that margin when, for the rest of the movie, the animation is replaced by production assistants spinning around an inner tube with teeth. There is no time for terror when this movie is half-hijacked by these rented boat rental idiots, who suddenly become the main characters; but again you have to admit that they try to be funny is better than creeping behind the sheriff. Just at the end one of them is eaten and the other is sitting on a stone crying in solitude - this is no fun!
