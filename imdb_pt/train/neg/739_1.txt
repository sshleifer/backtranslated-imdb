Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin at the wrong first step by supposing that Wells wrote the Gothic horror and that all its lines must be taken seriously. This simply is not true. Wells was very much an heir to the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that Victorian self-satisfaction could leave the British unprepared for the world that new technology could produce - both good and evil. <br /> <br /> Two terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer (I remembered Fay Wray in the original King Kong) instead of a man struggling to live the irony of an unbelievable catastrophe; and the dialogues full of 'Victorians' seriously expressed that Welles clearly wanted to be carried on the cheek. <br /> <br /> All this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood with a huge budget to waste on CGI effects - which, by the way, Warner Bros.'s car-factories of the 1940s could have done a better job . (Drops of speckled blood looked like red balloons, I hoped they would float at any minute.) Think of the Yellow Submarine as done by the old EC Comics. Worse still is the loss of the theme, which steals. the movie of any reason to exist. Although the producers of this film return the story to their Victorian era, they completely miss the odd way in which Wells's story predicted many of the horrors of World War One-a fact not unnoticed by Wells himself who, after the war, reshaped history . The theme in The Form of Things to Come. <br /> <br /> Without a theme, all we have here is a lot of people running around being played on cartoon balloons when they're not trying to get a high school production. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is the worst and most absurd nonsense I've had since a friend convinced me to see the Eastern European cartoon "Fantastic Planet" thirty years ago. . The film was so pretentiously monotonous, my friend and I and two complete strangers gave up mocking him in half and sat near the screen playing cards, using the film as light to see the cards - his only utility, as much as any of we could tell. <br /> <br /> But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I did not need that dismissal from Wells for anything. <br /> <br /> Do not avoid this movie - steal as many copies as you can (do not pay a cent) and burn each one. God in his wisdom created us only for this purpose.
