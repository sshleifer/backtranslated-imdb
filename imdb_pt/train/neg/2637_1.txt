Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It's like someone giving a billion-dollar budget to an autistic third grader and saying "make me a movie about the secret service." The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the direction ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was so useless and lame and meaningless ... and random ... and lame. <br /> <br /> Here's a SPOILER for you; This movie is the dumbest thing you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> However, if you liked this piece, you will also like it; Deterrance, Dark Blue and a partial frontal lobotomy.
