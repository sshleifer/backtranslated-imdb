Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and her son Alex to spend a few days with her family on Savage Island, an island of her own. The couple hopes to solve their problems over the weekend on the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor, and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of squatters squatters is living in the island. The irresponsible Peter smokes marijuana while driving the truck at night and turns off the beacon to show off; however, he accidentally runs over the young son of Savage's family, but in the dark he believes he hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims that Alex is a compensation for the lost son. The Young family does not accept trade, and they wage a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a low-budget film with a stupid script, amateur cinematography, but surprisingly good acting. The fault story is totally absurd and there are many unbelievable situations. For example, how could two men leave two women alone on the road at night with the threat of the crazed family? The logical procedure would be to immediately go to the mainland and bring the police force to rescue Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven leave their car on the mainland and their home and friends, and no one pursues them? Peter calls his sister Julia from Alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning. There are so many flaws in this movie that I could spend many lines writing about this subject. I believe this movie was filmed with a home video camera so horrible that the pictures are. The good cast deserved better material to work with. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Ilha do Sangue")
