This is a poorly made and poor remake of the classic Bimalda Wing. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and is a distortion of the original. Well, we can appreciate some degree of creativity, but not false creativity. The acting of everyone is affected and the whole film is a farce. The choice of words from Shekar's father to abuse Lolita (Balan) seems cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Once again the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) hits Lolita is completely out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters, it is quite shocking to the senses, and could have been easily avoided. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is completely unsuitable for the film and an inexpensive trick to attract the public. When creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit, the work falls apart. The song "piyu bole" is fine. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this film is the scene in which Saif stands out and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. In these accounts this movie deserves 3 stars. Rekha's music and dance are full of artifice and that's a good idea. The music is melodious, but I remember hearing it somewhere before and, if I'm not mistaken, it seems the music was plagiarized. <br /> <br /> Well, we agree that times have changed from then to now. But then this film is not even a reflection of modern times. This is what happens when modern Bollywood filmmakers become increasingly obsessed with impressing NRIs and grabbing NRI's lucrative entertainment market. Such films end up not belonging to India or any other part of the world.
