It's been a looooonngngg time since I've seen this comedy, and I'd forgotten just how idiotic it is. I'd easily put it in Elvis Presley's two or three lowest films. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, an Indian mestizo who returns home in Arizona and the shed where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night long. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offers anything of substance, comically or otherwise. The government has invested in the family's cattle, but they are without a bull. Elvis manages to sing only a few worthless songs, and is chased by a young crazy girl and his armed mother. This is just a real mess, and the ruined environment practically stinks of manure and does not make it much easier. The only thing that intrigues me, though, is that Elvis seems to be having fun in the movie. Hard to believe, considering he was so upset that he had been arrested for making so many mediocre movies.
