I think this movie is based on some kind of true story ... It's about two girls who harass an adult man for 48 hours; I do not see where the terror comes into play here ... There are some "weird" and "surreal" sequences in the movie And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... oh ... oh well) play the roll of two psycho-man type to the max ... they do a good job (although some are just a bit exaggerated) The movie is not good, and it's not horrible, it's really very old! I mean, this thing is dripping with the '70s. It's not too bad if you like that sort of thing ... you know ... this thing?
