Arg. The scrambling dinosaurs are back for another bite in our sanity in this horrible third movie. This time, European terrorists (I would say Irish) hi-jack an army convoy supposedly carrying uranium. They enter a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends, the carnossaurs. The Pandemonium comes to visit them when the rubber dinosaurs bite the terrorists, the police and some marines. Does the whole movie seem to be (again) largely Alien-inspired (as Carnosaur 2 was) with the pathetic Marines passing by the "claustrophobic" shipyard? guns at the ready. This third opus is probably the driest and most unusual film in the world, with only a blood spurt when a rubber dinosaur rips off a Marine's head. Dinosaurs are noisy, noisy creatures, as usual, and the T-Rex looks like a furious elephant when it roars (it also seems to have no eyes). One of the most idiotic scenes of the film is when the cops arrive: they enter the building where the kidnapped truck is kept and they hear some strange noise coming from another truck. Opening it, surprise! The rubber reptile gang exploded and devoured them. Why the dinos were locked in the second truck after escaping the first one? How did they lock themselves when the truck door could only be locked from the outside? What was the point of filming this scene ???? Oh, it bothers, who cares? Both thumbs down to the oversized rubber Iguanas.
