I just watched it after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative reviews here, you will not be able to understand how horrible this movie really is, although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen! I've never bothered to post a review here before, but this piece of shit really guarantees that. First of all, the whole plot is ridiculous and meaningless. Brother of the main character (Ben or Arthur, I forget which is which, and frankly is never very clear) want to stop some kind of gay marriage killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abominable to Christians, but apparently mass murder is not t. Then there's another crap thrown over an ex-wife of the gay couple trying to force him to marry again with a gun. This leads to nothing but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the entire "movie" - "I do not make sense? You do not make sense! That's the one that makes sense!". Bright. <br /> <br /> Then there is the acting, which is simply atrocious. Must be seen to be believed. My personal favorite is the seemingly stoned civil rights lawyer woman, who is clearly reading her lines for something, but still managing to ruin everything. Enough said. The gay couple could not be less convincing. There's the vaguely attractive and completely bland guy, and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon mass man of the Bisto ads. Just fatter. And less talented. <br /> <br /> The "movie" was also filmed by someone who is unable to hold a camera yet remotely, and the number of errors is incredible. The whole thing starts with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots. Yes. <br /> <br /> But anyway, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I'd like to highlight some of the most invaluable comedy moments the "movie" offers. <br /> <br /> - When the fat guy sets fire to the church and then steers like a six year old girl in the parking lot to get away. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! I have no idea what her relationship is with the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes not, but she does appear in some scenes, though. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> The stoned lawyer. You mentioned her, but she's so funny she deserves another mention. <br /> <br /> - The evil siblings' dinner of biscuits he puts on for his guests. <br /> <br /> - Anti-brother of the evil potion gay. <br /> <br /> - The evil brother's cats. <br /> <br /> - The end, which I will not give because it must be seen to be believed. I warned, though, make sure you're not eating right now! The tub of the main character of the lard / director / producer is left naked. Is bad. <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see for a long time. Literally, nothing good about this excuse for a movie, the director's cape even manages to make opening credits on a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.
