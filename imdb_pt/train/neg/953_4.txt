"Happy Go Lovely" has only two things to it. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British version (Excelsior Films) of a musical M-G-M complete with second-level stars. I imagine that Vera-Ellen took that role thinking that it could finally boost her to the status of a great musical star. But I'm sorry to say that Mrs. Ellen's chance was not rewarded. Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling into a horrible dialogue for the next monotonous song, this movie looks very heavy and sloppy. The misleading predictable identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is very much at the top in his role as a producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in a paper nothing) the rest of the O cast is totally forgettable. <br /> <br /> The choreography is boring, but Ellen gives it all. She was never as famous as most other musical stars (and she should not have been since she could not sing and still had a "standing dance" on several of her pictures.) But when she dances it was just a shame that this movie that could have made her a star has not given her the tools to shine. 4 out of 10
