Despite an animated film, he really bored everyone with at least 6 years. As an adult who grew up in an area with wild horses and Native Americans, he thought it was a combination of PC mixed with many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed. Talk to those who have lived on horseback, most of them treat their animals as family members, regardless of their history. Regardless of context, we deal with good and bad destroyers of wild horses. I had to explain that it was a real-life issue for us against moviegoers for the kids who were surprised to see how the PC showed a different world than they actually knew. normal disney or dreamworks turning rate talking animals burning the screen was nice from the viewer's viewpoint older. But if you live in an area similar to what is shown, you may end up answering questions.
