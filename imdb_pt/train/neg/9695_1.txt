NOTICE! Do not even think about watching this movie anyway. Nor is it worth downloading from the internet. Every piece of pornography has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid. The so-called filmmakers seemingly have absolutely no idea how to make a movie. They could not tell a good joke to save their lives. It is an insult to any human being. If you are looking for a movie full of fun - look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Let's hope that Mr. Unterwaldt (the "Jr." being a good indication of his obvious inexperience and intellectual childhood) dies. a slow / painful death and NEVER make a movie again. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's even a waste of time WRITING ANYTHING about this crap, that's why I stop now and I'd rather watch a good movie.
