This series is interesting to watch as an MST3K feature, but for today's audience it's all that it is. I was really surprised to see the year it was made in 1952. Considering that fact alone makes it a solid (humble?) 2 in my book. Used cars do not even look contemporary, they look like things from the 1930s. It's basically Cody (the lonely world's salvation? Talking about an insult to everyone else, like the military), anyway Cody is in his pajama pajamas against Graber and Daley two idiot thugs who use pistols and a very lame occasional ray gun in their own right, enjoy. If you want to watch a really good series, see Flash Gordan, it is full of rockets that attack each other and a good enemy of evil and also beautiful women, that does not have any of that. And Flash was made 15 or more years before that crap, so you can take a break. Something done in 1952, so bad, deserves a 2. Nuff said. Give it a 6 if you're watching as an MST3K episode, these guys have a lot of fun with it; a fit of nipples here, a fit there and I'm flying! And now, as an added bonus, I bring you the Commander Cody Theme song originally sung by Joel and his two bot characters, Tom Servo and Crow, on the love satellite episode of The Enemy Planet: <br /> <br /> Singing in the beginning credits); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) ITS CANDIDATE COMMAND ...
