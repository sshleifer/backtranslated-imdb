Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in an original copy that does justice to any merit it has as a movie. Unfortunately, that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> He has a competent cast of second-classists who absolve themselves as well as one might expect under the circumstances. It is efficiently driven, entirely in sound stages and permanent sets in the studio backlot. It sounds OK, but it's terribly overloaded, and in the barely 80 minutes, it's still very padded. <br /> <br /> For example, the attack of the double naja on the first of the soldiers was certainly one more attack. <br /> <br /> The deal about Julia choosing to marry Pete instead of Tom never amounts to anything. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julia (nor her). <br /> <br /> Julia's "feminine intuition" is presented as if it were to lead to an important plot. development, but this does not happen. Similarly, Pete's investigation into snake cults and the suspicion that he falls briefly on Tom are of no use other than filling the time on the screen. <br /> <br /> These are just symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is structured as a mystery, but it is not. Once the curse is pronounced, we know exactly where the story is going, so the characters are meticulously discovering what we already know. <br /> <br /> The ending is particularly unsatisfactory. Julia is purely threatened by accident. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - she's simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom shows up at the time to save her, it is unclear if she has been threatened. He then simply discards the snake in the way that any of the previous victims could have done. <br /> <br /> It's such an irrelevant and insignificant story that I caught myself wondering how the scene was thrown. the studio heads. Then it occurred to me. Someone said, "Those Val Lewton films were very successful at RKO, so why do not we do one like this?" The cult of the Snake is clearly inspired by Cat People: mysterious, problematic, the woman who changes form falls in love with the hero, apparently is frigid, kills people, arouses suspicions of the friend of the hero and dies in the Last. But 'modeled in' does not mean 'as good as' - by a wide margin. It copies, but does not understand what it is copying. <br /> <br /> Obviously, he's trying on the discreet and suggestive Lewton style, but this approach does not follow the story. Lisa is not Irene. It must be strange and mysterious, but there is no mystery about it. We got a glimpse of her after the first attack in Asia, so we immediately recognized her when she showed up in New York. There is never any doubt about its purpose. Nor is there any ambiguity about whether it really does turn into a snake. <br /> <br /> So again, during your night wander, we did not get one, but two attempts at 'bus'. Neither one leaves, because the director does not understand what makes a 'bus' work and, in any case, they happen to the pursuer, not to the person being pursued. <br /> <br /> These weak echoes of Cat People give the Cult of Snake any little distinction it may have, but they only draw attention to the chasm between the original and the imitation. Plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I doubt that Lewton or Tourneur was particularly flattered when this little passer-by passed.
