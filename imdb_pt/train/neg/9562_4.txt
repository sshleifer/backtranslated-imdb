I think this could have been a decent movie, and some of its parts are cool ... but overall it's a B movie. Same about the plot, the parts are OK, but there are several holes and oddities that do not add up . Acting is mostly OK, I've seen worse of that as well. :) <br /> <br /> The beginning sets the level, with cars driving in the desert, making "cool" jumps, but totally unnecessary through some small dunes (slow motion! Cool!), as the riders never had seen sand before ... It gets a little better from there, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you are going to rent this, get another one too and use this as heating. Keep expectations low and this may work for you.
