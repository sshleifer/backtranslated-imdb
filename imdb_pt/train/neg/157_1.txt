OK first of all the videos looks like it was filmed in the 80's I was shocked to find out that it was released in 2001. Secondly the plot was all over the place, so face to face the story is confusing. If there had been a brief prologue or introduction, the story would have been better. I also appreciate the fantasy, but this movie was awesome. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were strange. It was difficult to keep up with and maybe it was the translation, but it was difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you are looking for an epic Chinese fantasy film I would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, interesting plot and good character development) not this movie. Be careful, you will be disappointed.
