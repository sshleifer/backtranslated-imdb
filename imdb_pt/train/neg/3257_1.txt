After seeing the movie, the first question that came up in my mind was: Is this an irony or not? After reading some comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic book series, I knew this movie should not be ironic. So the story tells us about an American and American Super-Doc saving a South American republic from evil. Sounds like a typical story. But it comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. The mandatory final fight shows the worst martial arts presentation I have ever seen. The film may be interesting to designers of low budget films as a bad example.
