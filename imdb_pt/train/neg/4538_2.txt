I really went to see this movie in a theater, but what a waste of time and money! Bad acting, sorry to say, did not help to appreciate this rather sticky script. Some friends told me to go see this movie, since James Redfield, the author of the book, was very heavily involved in the script. They really liked the book, so the movie had to be perfect. Well, maybe I got a little too loud, but I hated this movie! It was predictable, very sweet to a point that I stopped vomiting and worst of all is that there will be a sequel! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade.
