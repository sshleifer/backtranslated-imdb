"Meatball Machine" has to be one of the most complex ridiculous, horrific, and exaggerated horror-fiction horror films I've ever seen. It is about good versus evil and a tale about the age, with the aim of entertaining with bloody, despicable and humorous context. Because of this, the violence is not particularly horrible and does not make you squirm, but the free sangria and nakedness run freely. The performances of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I have seen, if that was not enough, it is also directed by an unpublished director named Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie only has it all, its bad for the bone !, a must see for every b-movie freak !!! ... Simply: a rare and enjoying jewel.
