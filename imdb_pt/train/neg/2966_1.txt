I can not understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap splatter, you'll love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - do not watch it. Personally I really did not like the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired straight from the street. The Dialogues are completely flat and you always know what comes next. The overall quality of this film lacks the supposedly low budget. When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) that we all had in mind, this movie was made by some people who needed to do this, only to get their degree at a film school - with the least effort. Another issue that really slows down the whole experience is the camera bad (very shaky) and the sound bad, the whole movie seems to be recorded with a single microphone.
