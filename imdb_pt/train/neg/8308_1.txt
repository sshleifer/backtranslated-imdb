Entertainment Tonight has fallen in recent years, but as of last night (August 17, 2006) they have reached a new low. In an effort to try to publicize their broadcast, they decided to post actual photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body in their teasers last night ... saying "Photos of the case you've never seen before." The two photos were graphic and very disturbing. One was on the side of the face and the head / neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around the neck and hurt her face. It was so horribly awful I could not believe it. How does this have anything to do with anything remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment? Anything!! They lowered their level of dignity and values ​​to a new low .... and it shows. This used to be the debut show to watch ... and it's just crap now. <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch Access Hollywood from now on.
