Quite unimpressive. The 'twists' are fairly predictable, if you have seen a movie in the last ten years, and the few interesting bits (where someone uses context clues to make a decision) are few and far from successful, since' already has been shown before these clues are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilers, sorta) <br /> <br /> The acting is decent enough. The story simply is not very interesting. The whole premise "still awakens" becomes void by the material of the astral projection (no joke). <br /> <br /> The surgery scene is initially tense, a bit uncomfortable, but then it becomes totally banal. <br /> <br /> Not awful, but not memorable. The less interesting role of Terrence Howard so far, as far as I've seen. <br /> <br /> Bit boring, overall.
