Take in some pretty young people, put them in an exotic place, pick up some bad guys, get the two main characters to find romance after some heavy breathing scenes, create the most insignificant plots, and then create a happy ending for everyone besides the three or four who are murdered, of course) This is the classic (and successful) format of Harlequin Romance. Not very good, but also not too bad, like most small yellow paperbacks. And the place in Budapest is especially interesting, even if they do not use the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or show the famous thermal baths of the city.
