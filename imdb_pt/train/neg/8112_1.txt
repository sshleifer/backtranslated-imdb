Hanna-Barbera sucks the life of another famous property. The violence is diluted, the stories are stereotyped, the animation is bad, the music is nasty and repetitive and, frankly, the show is not funny. <br /> <br /> At the time, HB put each of his series through the same clich√© situations, regardless of whether it fit into the cartoon world or not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ("Hey! Popeye is popular, and the Flinstones are popular. Put them together, and you can not lose!"). In addition, in an apparent imitation of "Private Benjamin," Olive Oyl and Goon have a regular segment that introduces them as new army recruits. Seriously! Because? <br /> <br /> In addition to the annoyance factor, there are the public service announcements in each episode (standard practice at the time for cartoons but still annoying). Popeye tells his nephews about crossing the street safely, recycling and - are you ready for that? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I'm not making this up.) <br /> <br /> The only remaining charm of the original drawings is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice from the early days, continues the role here. <BR> It is worth checking once only to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
