I hate to cast lines like that, but in this case I feel I need to: The American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst movie I've seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There I said that. And now that I've removed it from my system, please let me explain why. "When a man dies in the grip of a mighty fury, a curse is born, the curse is gathered in that place of death, and those who find it will be consumed by their fury." That's the premise of THE GRUDGE and I'll admit it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not go further. Those who find the "curse" are actually consumed by your fury and that's all you get. You want more? Well, too bad Some critics and fans are pointing out that THE GRUDGE's sole purpose is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to speak, scary images and sounds can go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film, tries valiantly to build atmosphere in the first hour ?? repeating the same scene over and over again and again. This goes on as follows: <br /> <br /> - people come into the house <br /> <br /> - something goes through the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - the sound starts to get louder <br /> <br /> -the man sees a ghost <br /> <br /> - loud scream and / or cry of cat <br /> <br /> -cut to black <br /> <br /> Even before the audience gets a plot suggestion, this same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour. The first time was really a little scary. Each subsequent use became laughable as the movie continued. At the end of the movie, my friend and I were laughing, wondering if this scene would end "with a loud scream and a black cut." We have never been proven wrong. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a linear plot, instead unfolding into a series of vignettes that leave the audience confused. I have no problem with non-linear narrative when this is done correctly. The movie jumps from period of time to period of time without rhyme or reason. I have not seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique is any kind of mystery the movie could have had. If you already know that the ghosts scared two characters to death, how shocking is it when their bodies are found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? Obviously, the second American version of THE RING made $ 15 million in its first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing more than calculated imitation disguised as a real movie. The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it grossed $ 40 million the first weekend and some people consider the film "the scariest of all time." I wonder what happens to those who are consumed by the fury of paying to see the grog?
