I do not understand this. The film obviously has a good budget. It has very good photography. Has good rhythm, good editing and good direction too. So why did not they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script, so it would not be so extravagant and why they hired such bad actors that they can not get out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. Most of the time it looks good and feels good but in the end you realize that the movie was not good at all. <br /> <br /> So, I'd say it's a good production, but a bad movie. Too bad, actually. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come one, really!
