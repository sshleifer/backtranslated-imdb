If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend your $ 9 on a used book, not in this movie. I'm a bit worried that the money I've spent is being used to buy Kool-Aid for shipping to Guyana. <br /> <br /> I do not think the directors really have any opinion, but it seems that maybe they were trying to do several: 1) Science can explain everything we do, which means that our lives are deterministic; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, which means we have free will; 3) Science is very cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a hard role to follow and 7) here, put this small square of paper in your mouth and you will see some really groovy things.
