I read all the comments about this movie. I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama. As such, I read the book on which this movie was based. The film is an ugly and degrading fiction of truth. I do not criticize you for altering small details or events for dramatic purposes; it's not a documentary. But the script CHANGES the impact, the reaction, the realities and the changes in ALL the main characters. It changes much the true relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From ridiculous rivalry by a Tibetan woman (who devastates Tibetan culture) to the gift of Harra's music box, to Harrar's heart change, everything about this movie is false - except <br /> <br /> For incredible photography. I understand that the Potala (the palace) shots were smuggled out of Tibet. However, changing a real story about the relationship between two people, one of them very important to this world in order to build a movie star is sad
