Evil Breed is a very strange horror film that unfortunately is not good. The beginning of the movie looks promising, but overall it is a disaster. The dialogue is very bad but not as bad as acting. The acting is brutal and unbearable. More of the characters deliver the lines horribly and even if that is on purpose, the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some of the killings are groundbreaking, but it took a long time to get to them. After about half an hour in the movie we have the first death (different from the beginning) and then almost all the other characters are smoked in the next five minutes. The film then turned into a kind of parody with ridiculous characters, unreal karate as fights, and a scene in which a man strips the intestines from his sack. None of this is funny, it's just ridiculous. The film then becomes ultra-bloody and ultra senseless. Most of the characters are cliches even by terror standards and are as solid as they have left on the counter for 5 days. Evil Breed is not even ridiculously bad, so he fails on his main task.Watch Massacre Texas Chainsaw, Just Before Dawn , or See No Evil for a true slasher.
