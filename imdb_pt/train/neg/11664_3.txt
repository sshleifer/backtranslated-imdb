I really wanted to enjoy this movie. He moved very slowly and was just annoying. If it had been on TV, it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? A great cast and photographer was working on a defective foundation. If this is loosely based on the director's life, why could not he get someone to see that the writing itself was "loose." So he drove in the rhythm of a snail that may have been the source of some people napping during the film. Music soars, but for a different movie, not this for the novel saga possibly. There were times when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I was not alone because I heard some rumors about who said what to whom. Why can not Hollywood make better movies? This one had the nugget of a great story, but it was poorly executed.
