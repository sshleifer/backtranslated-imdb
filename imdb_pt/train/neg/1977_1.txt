Wait, do not tell me ... they threw away the movie and they were left out. You know, this movie could have been filmed in an alley in New York. The "Gangster Bangster" I think. Gangster Rap, gangster designer clothes including the scarf that somehow was moved from the neck to protect against dust storms to the head. I think it was to protect the head of the heat filter through the K-Mart hats. "Budget rent-a-horsie", it seems, supplied the horses. The scene of a room where the girl was talking and the guy was talking her words ... I thought it was him talking. You know, watching this movie just confirms this, it's no longer about acting ... it's about the looks and the money. There could not have been much of what this movie is all about. Well, after all, I think this movie will be the worst movie ever. Just one more thing, where was Ice T? Did he finally get Oprah?
