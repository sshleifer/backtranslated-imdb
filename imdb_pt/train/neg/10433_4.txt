The fight scenes were great. I loved the old and new cylinders and how they painted those on their side. It was the end I hated. I was disappointed it was dirt, but 150k years ago. But traveling all that way just to start over? Are you kidding me? 38k people who fought for their very existence and once they reach paradise, they abandon technology? No way. Of course they were eating paper and rationing food, but that was over. They can live like humans again. They just have a good doctor. What will they do when someone has toothache, it does not matter giving birth ... yes, right? No one would have made that choice.
