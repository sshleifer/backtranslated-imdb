One can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this film was too much. Virtually nothing was anywhere near the truth, and even for the time, it was seen as silly. In defense of the ford, it was revealed in an old talk show, which he was operating in history as told to him by the true Wyatt Earp, who was obviously old, senile, and repeated the scene in his own way. Earp told the director about the stagecoach, and how it was planned to happen during the arrival of the stagecoach, so despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself states that he was premeditated. <br /> <br /> This movie portrays Earp as an honest. man, and also his brothers. The story does not say exactly what they were or were not. Most people like to insert a bit of cheating and illegality into their characters, but that's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them, being the law that meets the types of GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw this as a career, and believe me, in the old west, you did not have time to think about much more. <br /> <br /> Characters that do not exist, characters portrayed dying in the Curral that did not really do, all this makes a weaker film. He is further weakened by Mature, who did not really make a convincing Doc. He may be the worst cast choice ever for Doc, but at the same time we must remember that older movies were closer to the age and closer to the feel of truth. After all, Ford got firsthand information from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> It is also weakened by all the predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro Nazi in those days and was ready to kill brunet women in a very predictable way to show their patronage to Hitler's idealism. This occurs in most movies until the 1980s. No excuse, and cheap the art, though. <br /> <br /> The actors who play the Earps do well, and Brennan is always an emotion. In fact, Madura may be the only downside to this movie. Still, it's the weakest of old OK Corral movies.
