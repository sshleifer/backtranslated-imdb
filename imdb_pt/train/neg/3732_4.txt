Maybe because I was so young, innocent and moody when I saw him, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I have not seen it since I was in seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure what effect it would have on me right now. However, I will say that this left an impression on me ... and most of my friends. This served its purpose, at least until we were old enough and with enough knowledge to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly terrified of what Christians newly converted after the Rapture had to endure when they did not receive the mark of the beast. I do not want to ruin the movie for those who have not seen it, so I will not mention details of the scenes, but I can still imagine them in my head ... and it's been 19 years.
