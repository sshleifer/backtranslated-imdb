Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the town of Middleton. The four teenagers form two love triangles. One night, during a full moon, they drive and argue along a slippery, winding road. Not looking properly, they get into another car and one or more of them are dead. The ghostly nightmare begins ... Very bad and politically correct horror film, without gore and nudity. It is obviously influenced by the "Carnival of Souls". The cinematography is decent Unfortunately, there is zero suspense.4 out of 10 just another weird junk instantly teeny-bopper.
