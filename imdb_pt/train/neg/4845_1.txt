There is no artistic value in this film to deserve any prize. Well, that does not deserve an audience either. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography, but frankly, the camera moves are disconcerting to say the least. Each frame, you feel you are getting the "full picture", it is as if someone is "cutting your vision" from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I'll be honest, I could not bear to watch the whole movie. The part that most sucked was when I saw the soldiers in their stalls and one of the soldiers persuaded to drink alcohol. These and many other similar scenes reminded me a lot of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice, stay away from this piece of crap.
