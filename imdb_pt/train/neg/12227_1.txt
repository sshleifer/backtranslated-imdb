This may be the worst movie ever made and possibly worth seeing for just that reason. Streisand is ridiculously unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is excruciating, with Barbara singing some of the weaker and funniest jokes of all time. And do not even get me started on the plot. You will actually laugh more of the movie than many comedies because it is soooo terrible. Streisand's rampant ego, thinking that she could somehow elevate this stink to Oscar's height, led to this disaster. I'm sure the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hated this film and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This movie is like watching a car accident in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of 'The Sound of Music' being played back on an old turntable. It's really that bad. I'm surprised that someone from Streisand liked this movie at the level it was planned for.
