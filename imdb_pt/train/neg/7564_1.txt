The wicker man. I'm so angry that I can not write a proper comment about this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, tightly bound, and completely - just lame. Nicolas Cage ... what a shame! I assumed that as long as you were in it, it would be at least decent. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt as if huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor, and even if it was complete - the movie was just bizarre and silly. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the end you're open-mouthed, confused mind and offended good taste. I've never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with such hate. People complained in small groups at the mall, four stories below the theater, near the entrance. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> I heard it compared to: Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so angry that he did not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
