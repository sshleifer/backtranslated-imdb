Maybe I have not found the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Clearly, the default is OFF. When the final credits started rolling, I could not believe it was that. Like our poor but handsome protagonist, I felt accustomed, dirty, cheap ... The characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the writer's disdain for the rich Thatcherites was evident. I consider myself a "Democrat of Roosevelt," but would appreciate a little more subtlety. <br /> <br /> Of course the problem could be with me. I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this image. Unfortunately, I do not. <br /> <br /> The only thing that stopped me from giving a "1" was the pleasant, human and vegetable scene.
