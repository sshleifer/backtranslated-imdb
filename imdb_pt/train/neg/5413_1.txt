After the reasonably successful MASTI that was a little better, Inder Kumar came back again with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood movie SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO MOMENT <br /> <br /> The movie recalls HUM HAI KAMAAL KE ( 1994) where Kader and Anupam interpret the blind and deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a tedious exercise <br /> <br /> The film has such absurd jokes that you do not feel like laughing like the head of Snehal Dabi getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those comedies of the sort that we do not laugh at right now but sneer <br /> <br /> The movie starts in a clich√© way and some scenes are funny, unfortunately, those moments no While the story never moves in this half, even the comedy gets boring The turnaround is well treated and the second half becomes an action movie where the blind and deaf will rescue the heroines and we have all the scenes of chase and fight scenes <br /> <br /> Directed by Inder Kuma r is bad Music is well, a song stands out I LOVE YOU MY ANGEL <br /> <br /> Vivek is horrible in the comic scenes, his time is very bad and he is well in serious scenes For some reason he continues to do comedy and ruined his career Fardeen Khan is a bit better but a lot of wood Among the others Esha and Amrita are the heroines Boman Irani irritates here Snehal Dabbi is well
