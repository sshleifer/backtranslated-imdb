The peculiar charisma of Martin Kosleck brings some credibility to his character of the frustrated artist. He imbues his dialogue with a strange sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character manages to become a real person and not a typical villain of the movie B. The plot is nothing to write, and many scenes are monotonous. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper. Kosleck's phallic and philosophical character is contrasted with Hatton's monosyllabic and discrete approach. The Creeper character is not developed far beyond a basic level of monster, but Hatton suggests underdeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his story. <br /> <br /> This movie was a lot at the Shock Theater when I was a kid, so I have a kind of nostalgic fondness for it. It's worth seeing it, anyway, for anyone who likes horror movies of the forties.
