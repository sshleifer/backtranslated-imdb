When I say "Doctor Who," you can invoke an image of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee or perhaps Peter Davison. When I say "James Bond," you'll almost certainly conjure up an image of Sean Connery, while a handful of people might think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. But when I say "Sgt Bilko" absolutely everyone will think of Phil Silvers. Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond, the role belongs exclusively to an actor. And that's the problem with this cinematic version that you would always wish you were watching the old black and white program. In fact, the whole idea of ​​making a film version of BILKO without Silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilege.
