This is the first review of the non-zombie subgenre, but the film is worth doing a review. Dinocroc is a good movie overall, but unfortunately it's still an obvious b movie. Dinocroc itself looked great, but I thought the film itself needed a bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the crocodile is shown or is in a fight scene it does not happen much except the croc is shown and the crocodile kills or flees in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was excited, which is an advantage and the acting was better than average and the most amazing thing is that the crocodile looked fleshy, instead of a cartoon * cough * curse of the komodo * cough. I liked that movie enough to be happy that there will be a sequel that is more than I can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and worth seeing.
