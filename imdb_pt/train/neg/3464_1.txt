It seems that several of the people who reviewed this movie just watched it first because it was filmed near where they live. How's that for a ringing endorsement? If this movie was filmed near where I lived I would not be mentioning it in my comment. It's awful! Several critics claim that this film is a fake or ironic horror film, it is neither. It's sad to see this commented movie as a comedy, as this not only makes it a bad attempt at a horror movie but also as a comedy. I laughed, however, how incredibly bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> This film has two good things, the mask and the weapon of choice, unfortunately it would have been more interesting to watch an hour and half of the mask and gun lying on a table and then watching this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also laughable, juvenile and stupid. Do not bother with this movie, you already lost time reading this review do not miss this movie. Arrggghhh! It's infuriating that movies like this are made. I hoped the whole team would be credited to Alan Smithee, a name used when a person, usually a director, does not want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing redeemable in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 on rent and I feel like I was robbed. Avoid. 1 out of 10
