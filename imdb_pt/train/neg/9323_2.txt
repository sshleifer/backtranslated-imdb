What did I just watch? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the most stupid movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary to see that there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns .... but having to be a clown killer singing rhyme of 300 pounds makes a mockery of the genre. I'm still wondering how the character Mark was not able to get away from the clown ... he's 300 pounds, he should get tired eventually. The whole end made me get up and literally say out loud "What did I just watch?" Apparently, Brandon is Denise's cousin ... and they put him near the middle of the movie, which means he had sex with his cousin ... yes, that's something people want, so watch * shivers *. Another thing I thought was hilarious and stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says, "What did you do?" Well, what do you think he just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was a second in which the protagonist was hitting the hitch-hiker and calling her ac-nt and then 5 minutes later saying that the violence was not helping at all ... the writer gave the phrase for the wrong guy? None of these movies makes sense anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less a low-budget movie that I was sucked into to buy (all 3.99) and had no entertainment beyond the sex scenes. I'm surprised that the fat clown did not join the orgy, it would have fit nicely. I hoped the movie had some entertainment value as other B movies could have, but I was wrong. This is a stupid piece of junk that's not even worth watching. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
