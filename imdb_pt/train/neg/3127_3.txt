An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) accidentally stumbles on an old 40-foot mummy, well preserved in the subsoil of the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep it a secret and call on a Jewish translator to help discover his story. The mummy, as explained at the outset, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed "in those days." In order to save his son from a devastating flood that was predicted to kill everything, he mummifies his son, burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to wake him years from there. In our present, the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual must take place. Most of the film is slow, it has to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple of bad fights. The mummy looks good, but it is not shown enough. He should have had more to do with it, but he crawled a lot, so ... eh. Do not bother yourself.
