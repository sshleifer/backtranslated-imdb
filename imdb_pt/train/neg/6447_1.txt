I bought this movie for $ 5 in a bargain box in my local video store for a single reason, Chase Masterson, but I should have disintegrated all five, thrown in a toilet and flushed. The film is about a group of twentysomethings who reached high school and met on the anniversary of his death of idiot friends, who got drunk and went into the forest and died. There is a problem where a reptilian monster is hunting them one by one. The acting is terrible, these worthless people were seemingly discarded at shows like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The direction was on par with a child of twelve and the script was probably done by a child of thirteen years of age. The whole set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. The people here who praised this film are obviously friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this pile of garbage at all costs.
