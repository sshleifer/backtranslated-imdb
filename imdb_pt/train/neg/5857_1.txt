WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps his biggest flaw was the fact that he did not follow the same path for most of the previous Survivor series. There was only one set of survivors series. And that match of Survivor Series lasted 45 minutes. In addition, anyone with a working brain would know that it would end with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock prevailing for their team. And do not get me to start previewing before the event. No matter who won, it was obvious that no one was going to starve. There was no need for all this pointless hype. Whatever the plot, it was just a wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of the games: the first game was Christian defending his European title against Al Snow. It was a good fast game and it's good to see a jump win a game fairly. William Regal versus Tajiri was boring and we've seen it two or three times before. Edge versus Test was good but nothing great. The steel box game was the best game of the night. The actual battle lasted 10 minutes and no one really cared who would win in the first place. The women's title race was not great. No not a bit. The main event must have been the most hypocritical game in history. The Alliance lost, but guess what, after 5 months all Alliance superstars have returned. The game itself was bad. Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho eliminated 2. Rock was very involved with their acting to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who harmed the whole game. If I wanted any 2 to be eliminated at the beginning, it would be them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just autumn men. 7 matches are not enough for a Survivor series. If there is always a Survivor series as bad as that again I go
