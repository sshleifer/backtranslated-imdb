This has to be the worst movie ever !!! The acting is more frightening than the movie. So much blood, but no idea where it comes from, because they do not even show the cuts. I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. This is a shame for horror movies! On the one hand, if they are in Asia, why is there a white cop going through trash cans? There are so many other languages ​​that you do not even know what is happening in half the time. Mounting the film is a joke, my teen could do better. And if I went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working at the window, that would be the first clue. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!! Do not even see how bad it is, you'll be sorry you did !!
