OK, when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked very scary and was very excited to see what it was like the group I was with. Now living in America especially during this election I see some very misleading things, but I have to say that these previews were at the top of the list. I do not see how many people could get scared at this movie. I just noticed two real scenes and just jumped on one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and maybe it spoiled some of the jumping scenes for me. As for the sound effects, many were so frightened that I thought they were comic at best. Oh, and the uhh boy, where did that come from, and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the strange moan. How does that scare someone? I can make that noise easily. Now, do not get me wrong, I've always loved all those really bad horror movies that you're laughing at all the time, but I did not even think that this movie had to work out, it was just bad.
