"The Leap Years" is a film adapted from an e-novella by Singaporean writer Catherine Lim, which became the first Singapore novel to be sold on the internet. The film had a tortuous post-production timeline: filmed in early 2005, it was slated to be released in late 2005, but only appeared three years later, on February 29, 2008, a leap year. Before saying anything, I must first admit that I am not a fan of the novel genre, so I may be a bit biased against this film - I merely saw it because it was a production from Singapore, and that it is available for loan in my neighborhood library. Here are my two cents in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let's just start saying that besides KS and Wong Li-Lin from Qi Yu-wu, everyone of note seems to be an Eurasian. The love interest is an Eurasian (Ananda Everingham), and the trio of Wong's friends are all er-Hem, Eurasians. Does this movie perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love with and relating to the Eurasians is more "in" than ordinary Chinese (or whatever Asian race you are?) I do not know, it sure does. Also, everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical "anglicised" accent that does not exist anywhere, certainly not in Singapore. It's the kind of "semi-perfect English" the authorities would like us to say, but it does not exist anywhere outside, say, the MTV Channel. The effect is that the dialogue of the film sounds forced and blistered, not helped by the lack of true Blue Singaporeans in the cast. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to be trying too hard to thread one line after another. one-liners. After twenty minutes, the "wit" of the film begins to fade and the film begins to serve its usual clich√©s plate. <br /> <br /> I do not think I liked the movie because the whole premise of sustaining a love affair for 16 long years seems unbelievable. <br /> <br /> There are other unbelievers in the movie. I can not believe that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) would fall in love with one of Wong's girlfriends. And the scene where the groom says, "Go ahead, before I change my mind," has been used on hundreds of TV series from East Asia (Korean, Chinese, Chinese, Taiwanese, etc.) ... <br /> < So 4 stars for this movie. The production value is fair, and Wong Li-lin tries her best, but she is not helped by the script. Joan Chen has a 15 minute piece in the film as the older Wong and is perhaps the best actress in the group, but hey, her role is just a special turnout. <br /> <br /> If you come across "The Leap Years" in the rental or library, you may want to put it on the DVD player out of curiosity, but on the other hand, for people who do not exactly like the romance genre , you can decide whether or not to lose.
