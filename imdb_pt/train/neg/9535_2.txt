Believe it or not, this movie is worse than number three. It is slower, the acting is worse and the story is very weak. There is not much to say about this movie. Even the fighting scenes are more monotonous than number three, and I would have thought that impossible. This is a very slow 90 minutes. Still, actually. I held on, hoping it would get better. If you really want to see this film, you should try to find a cheap rent from it.it is difficult to find (for purchase, that is) and probably for good reason.like number three, this movie has nothing to do with the first two. the same in the name only.any, the more I can give the best of the best: without warning it is 2/10
