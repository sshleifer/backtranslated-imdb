A few weeks ago I read George Orwell's classic novel, 1984. I was fascinated and found it to be one of the best books I read recently. So when I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation was measured. Unfortunately, the film did not even come close to creating the mood or developing the characters that Orwell did so masterfully in his book. The director seems to think that everyone who watched the movie read the book because it makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel what they feel. John Hurt, the main actor, is fun all the time, and hardly acts to the end. We never really figure out what he does for a living, either because his love affair is outlawed, or what the political climate is, and why the main character wants rebellion. This book can not be done justice in film form without proper narration and explanation of the political system that overwhelms the characters, and the fact that they are missing is the biggest flaw of this film. In addition, John Hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking about 15 years older than Winston, 39, who he should be playing. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. It's too bad they were put into such a horribly fit movie with the wrong lead actor. -Brian O.
