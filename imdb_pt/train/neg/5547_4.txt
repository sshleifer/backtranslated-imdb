ZOMBIES REVOLT (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not a long-lost ancestor for the classic zombie movies of George A. Romero. This is a low budget potboiler from 1936 that probably looked really cool to the public at the time ... but it seems very routine these days. There really is a very good scene at the beginning of a soldier firing his pistol at a horde of zombie soldiers approaching ... and a close-up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. The effect seems hopelessly false these days, but in 1936 I'm sure the audience gasped. The story concerns the quest for the secret of mind control ... ostensibly to create an unstoppable zombie army ... but later as a means for a character to win the woman he loves. The movie is only an hour long, but moves in the rhythm of a snail, so it seems that the size of the feature, believe me! There really is not much to recommend ... you can have fun with the fake photos of the star studio "wading" through a "swamp". The ending is interesting ... so I would say that the movie is worth being seen at least once. More than likely you'll see this as an extra feature in some "4 movies on 1 DVD" compilation at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's well worth the money ...
