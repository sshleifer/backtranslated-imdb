I like a movie that has at least a trace of a story. This does not occur in this movie. It's a series of stickers without cohesion. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. A woman in a blonde wig never removes her sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why. It disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another flirtatious woman who cleans without stopping a man's apartment. There are endless scenes in a fast food diner where Mamas & Papas's California Dreaming is overdone (I used to like the music). The dialogue is mainly concerned with the food (pineapple, chef salad and drink orders ??). I assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because so much fast food was consumed. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is supposed to be a novel - it is not so. I just wonder why I did not hit Fast-forward. Have I been waiting for something significant to happen? this doesn `t happen. Perhaps this is the only consolation for this film - the scenes have changed so quickly that you were led to suppose that there would be a revelation for all this absurdity.
