I was so disgusted with this movie, I felt compelled to warn others. This movie has no story, plot or suggestion of purpose. The film begins after the introduction of the standard "let's be scary" movie, which all moviegoers have grown accustomed to. So we can skip the start altogether. Soon we are introduced to the lead actress and from there it is clear to everyone that you just wasted your hard-earned money and it would be best to watch the static. (Unless you have seen the white noise - EEK) Acting is a DOOM and they must all return to the traveling pantomime from which they came. That said, even the best actors in the world would fight to make this movie remotely watched. Their poor performance only contributes to disaster. Pointless violence and what I can only assume is that the written word of another "eccentric" writer, who probably considers himself an artist, has resulted in a film that will test his patience. It was not until my partner turned to me and said, "We've been watching this for 45 minutes" I realized that this movie is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it was not the public. Instead of suggesting what the film is missing, let me tell you what it has: Blonde dumb (surprise surprise), Victims, bad monster thing, about 2 minutes of story that stretches for hours, days, weeks, months ... and credits. <br /> <br /> Do you want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is a bit cheeky looking at some scenes, but hopes to want to see her face ripped out by the rest of the movie!
