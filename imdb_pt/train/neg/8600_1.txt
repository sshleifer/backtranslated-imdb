Throughout the low budget history. this movie has to be one of the worst. True ther are some humorous aspects to the movie, but overall it was just awful. I just can not understand that person can not run a bunch of slugs. I mean, they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only worthwhile part in this movie is the close-up of an attempt to slug a man's finger. That was pretty fun.
