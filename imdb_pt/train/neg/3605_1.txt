The box cover makes this movie look pretty good, do not be fooled. Splatter University came out in 1984, which was the last year good for terror, but this movie sucks. the characters are so annoying. only the teacher is legal. there is no plot for this movie, who the hell could produce this waste of a movie? <br /> <br /> Spoilers ahead <br /> <br /> The teacher dies on this, and it was a female, we all know we should have a female survivor if you will break the rules do it in a good horror movie not this waste
