Tromaville High has become an immense immoral wilderness thanks to the after effects of the accidental release of toxic waste from the nearby nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> Unbridled chaos, filled with absurd violence and crass behavior. Quite horrible, obviously meant to be, a mess of a movie with the filmmakers releasing the reins allowing the talentless reign of the free cast to stop him. The office was well below Troma's list of goals for this bloody abatement. The honor society is punks with mysterious works of facial painting and crazy clothes. The German teacher who becomes a member, through a "toxic kiss," has stripes on one side of her face that really gave me shivers. The toxic monster, who dispatched the IRRITATING punks to the end, is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie junkies will embrace with all their heart.
