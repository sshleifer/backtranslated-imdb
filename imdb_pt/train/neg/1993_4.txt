The six-hour Italian mini-series of Franco Rossi's Quo Vadis, 1985, is a very curious beast, creating an absolutely convincing Roman world indeed (very few long planes without large urban landscapes), but representing the drama in favor of allusions to classical literature and the history that history is constantly lost in the background. <br /> <br /> The unstable structure (much of episode one is interpreted by voice over letters) and lack of urgency narrative full six hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding, and certainly all too often not engaging but has something to do with it. The two main strengths are the characterization of Petronius (a failed Frederic Forrest, whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue) as a man who spent so much time looking for a shrewd angle to survive life at court that he became unable to feel emotion . and Klaus Maria Brandauer's unique vision of Nero as an aspiring actor, whose every move and action is calculated on how his 'audience' will receive him. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow briefly appears in a few episodes, being rewarded with the most impressive and genuinely thrilling scene of the show, where he meets a child while trying to leave Rome. It's the kind of thing that the program could do with more, but it seems they often flatten out every potentially emotional, inspiring or thrilling moment under their ruthless discrete direction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Francesco Quinn makes an incredibly anonymous hero, mingling with the walls and coming less like a Roman officer than that quiet, rather bland, but harmless guy who works in the same office as you you never talk much about office parties - you know, the one you think of is called Dave or something. Budgetary constraints are very noticeable as the time of the Lions' Encounter for Christians and Ursus with the bull is so decidedly low that it has passed you before the program abruptly loses interest and ends abruptly. <br /> <br /> It is not a trip that I particularly can recommend, but if you embark it it is not totally without its small rewards.
