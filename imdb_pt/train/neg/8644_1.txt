This is a complete Hoax ... <br /> <br /> The film was filmed in the northwest of the Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; writing throughout is Hindi - language used in India. The walk is in the typical streets of Jaipur. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 km from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers in his (on the movie) DVD Bonus seem to make it sound like they risked their lives by shooting in Kabul and around. Almost all of the action scenes are filmed in India. The scene in which they see a group singing around the fire is so false that they have not even thought of changing it to Afgani folk music. They have just recorded the folk music of Rajasthan. How do I know this because I traveled a lot in this area? They are just in the wagon to do great on the subject. I challenge the filmmakers to deny this.
