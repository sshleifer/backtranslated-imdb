This movie is so bad and it worsens in every way imaginable. It is not only the poor performance and script, nor the lame and perverse time that is wasted by watching it. What really puts this movie in my hall of shame is the apparent struggle that writers and producers make with the film to try to make it funny. The actress who replaces Jean Reno's descendant is old and learned her lesson in the first film, so they add a new girl who is getting married. Almost all the original extras and gags come back, but this time it makes me want to take my eyes off the orbits because it's a perfectly good film waste. Torture from camera cuts and constant shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. This second film takes the successful original, drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but also our intelligence. This film, unlike the spruce goose, could not fly, as it had no plot in the directors returning to a 'collar'. No script since it was apparently written and added daily. No attention to the camera or photos in mind. Bad lighting and special effects made to do it. This movie would not even go through a student film in the basics of the movie 101. As this pile has passed, no one can say. It was a great investment lost and it seems that no one had the strength to put this cruel and natural error out of our miseries. This movie has a good part ... its the end! This movie is my # 1 worst movie ever, finally "Howard The Duck" is no longer the goose.
