This is a sad movie about this woman who thought that her ex that she loved so much was probably dead but actually her scientist father had just put a spell on him to turn him into a very cute shark face. Kind of like Beauty and the Beast. You could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some corner sconces, but there are some rather coarse plants instead. They make this girl really scratch, so she lets herself be eaten by the shark instead of scratching the whole movie. The scientist is a good father who tries to reunite his shark-fish son with the woman he was engaged to, he even gets them free time for sex, but the woman is a rather shallow snob and thinks that the expensive shark is a monster ugly and disgusting and does not want anything with it. She gave up on love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was very sad as all she had to do was kiss him and he would go back to normal and they would live happily ever after, but it's not that kind of movie.
