Holy shit! What a terrible, terrible Spanish suspense! I had this for about four years and finally started the other night. I watched an hour or more before going to bed. I was very intrigued by the whole thing. I finished last night and could not believe where I stopped the night before. Literally, I stopped in the second before the movie was completely downhill. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was very intrigued and curious about where this mystery was going, but it stopped when Simon received the package at Barra. I picked it up when he opens the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a "menacing" laser tag game. Ufa! So the great revelation is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot of RPG nerds. WHEW! You can say that the Spanish industry was definitely behind director Mateo Gil (co-author of two previous big hits of Amenabar). There is an excellent score and great photography. But this scenario smells like foolishness. How someone sat in the last 40 minutes with a serious face is beyond me.
