This film, originally released on Christmas 1940, was thought long lost. A very poor copy resurfaced and became a CD, now on sale. Do not buy! The film is indescribably terrible. The cast is bad, the script is horrible, and the direction is terrible. <br /> <br /> Photo Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie has been deliberately lost.
