I went to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The movie failed to meet them. <br /> <br /> I do not care about stories that increase credulity - Reign of Fire? - but I hope they are internally consistent. This movie jumped from screamer to screamer without stopping to breathe, all interspersed with special effects that were left behind, such as LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A mysterious warrior who changes shape from Korea, curiously metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and appearing as deus ex machina to get the unfortunate protagonists of his last mess. An FBI special agent who seems to be completely involved with old Korean folklore because of the Fed's excellent "paranormal division" - which has not been reported so far. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches and exclaiming, "I never wanted this to happen." A reincarnated pair of long-dead Koreans who "died like crazed lovers". Mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (who owe much to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a snake that wastes so much time roaring that every time their chosen prey is within reach, something appears to distract it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible, the acting of wood and the effect of the whole were, to be honest, tedious. However, for me, the time to crown was at the end, after the end, when the song for the final credits was - Arirang! It's as if Akira Kurosawa closes "Ran" with a karaoke version of My Way - and let me make it clear that I'm in no way comparing director Shim with Kurosawa. In short, an indulgent self, a lackluster collection of clich√©s and non-narrative sequels that may appeal to the melodramatic sense so prevalent in popular Quran culture, but should not be worth the ticket price for any serious movie goer - or even a not-so-serious movie goer. I would suggest that this would completely bypass the movie theaters and go straight to the video, but I'm not even sure it's worth it.
