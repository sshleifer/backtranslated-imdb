A Cinderella story made for adults living in the land of dreams. The novel is very unrealistic, vibrant, loving, perfect, etc. The plot of Cinderella to the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy novel with a twist, this is definitely your movie, but for the rest of us, real-world people, I recommend that you save your three-hour viewing time. Wake up people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who saw the movie with me would not recommend the movie. We had a great time beating most of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I'm missing something ... I just can not believe a movie like this can win a classic like HDDCS !!
