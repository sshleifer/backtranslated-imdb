If I were to create a movie thermometer, this film would be absolute zero. Of ten stars, I would rate it as follows: Synopsis: zero stars Video Quality: zero stars Sound Quality: zero stars Performance: zero stars <br /> <br /> It's as if Students of high school met an afternoon with a camera, made a plot and recorded a movie. It's so lacking in any artistic value that I'd rather see kids walking around a high school than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> However, something must be said for the abysmal depths. The "shooting" on the staircase is one of the funniest train wreck scenes of all time. First of all, the fighters simply waving plastic weapons at each other, waving their arms to simulate the retreat. The pair actually "attacks" nonexistent bullets. No snorers, no sparks, no empty spaces, just waving spray-painted nozzles. If you want to see two adult men playing "actor", take a spin someday ... after having cleaned the refrigerator, combed the carpet, polished all the knobs, gathered the gravel, straightened the books on the shelf, etc.
