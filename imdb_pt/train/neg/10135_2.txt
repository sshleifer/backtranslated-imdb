I watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through some things that I thought could have been improved; acting, writing, directing, special effects, film crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the writers had no idea of ​​anything to do with the film. Apparently in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could be completely invisible for $ 75 million. These things now cost about $ 3 billion and can not be invisible. Apparently you can fly from the US to the Middle East in an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I did not mind, but it seemed like a silly attempt to get more people to see her. The camera would approach the actors randomly and move on to random scenes. Oh yeah, since it's a Steven Segal movie, it's predictable as hell. After all, I'll classify him as Snakes on a Plane.
