I was so eager to see this when it was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest disappointment. Far from Dr. Seuss's capricious world. It was vulgar and tasteless I do not think Dr. Seuss would have approved. How the Grinch stole Christmas was a lot better. I understand I had some subtle adult jokes, but my kids still do not understand. While The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity, they caught more than I wanted. Growing up with Dr. Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic was destroyed on the big screen. Let's see what they do with Horton hears an I hope this one does to Dr. Seuss some justice.
