There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this movie. Let's face it though, the main reasons why anyone would watch would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this movie. I'm not saying they are not good actors, I'm saying they are idiots in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I'd say the filmmakers did a good job of making the ship look nice), but IT still has several major flaws. For example, just before the ship sinks, you may see an unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I LOVE the REAL Titanic story, but I find this movie an insult to this story. Editing was atrocious - there is no reason for any movie to be more than 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of a biopic film MAYBE), and the writing and screenplay was terribly flushed. <br /> <br /> I'll say the song was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go On"). There is a scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and the music from below is heard. This could very well be the highlight of the movie. As for humor, it was extremely annoying. I was more relieved than sorry when Jack died, which I know can not be what the director intended. In a nutshell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into a movie of sensational girls.
