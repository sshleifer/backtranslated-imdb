Vibrio cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel, however, there will be a change of power thanks to a renegade android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long) as they face Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels. cyborg in this ridiculous movie) Of all the questions left unanswered by this horrible movie, the most poignant is the idea of ​​who was to pitch the country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to do as well as he can. . No, do not get me wrong, I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something, but not like a cyborg. Oddly, it is suspected that this was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have had the wisdom of not doing so. However, despite the disastrous cast, Kristofferson is easily the nicest thing about the movie. It gives a much more human performance than the unimpressive Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson is playing with a robot) Despite the miscastar, Kristofferson provides a few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is crumbling and Gary Daniels is lost, but basically Knights is a disconcerting failure. You walk away in horror wondering who the hell thought that was even a good idea on paper. (This is a movie in which a dismembered Kristofferson is struggling with robots in a backpack) The worst of all ends in a sequence that, if it is, fortunately this still has to materialize, although I still have nightmares about the probability proposition of such an event. • Out of 4- (bad)
