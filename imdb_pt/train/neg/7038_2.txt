Oh yeah, in the 1980s, a time of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote forest that was exploding. At the time, I could not believe like movies like RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALUE (And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) They made money at the box office, they are a turgid festival of crap action wing schedule and they dated a lot bad. TROMA`S WAR is a kind of movie about these kind of movies, but you need to ask yourself if they needed spoofing in the first place? Of course not . TROMA WAR does not have any kind of sophistication - although it points out that there is no real difference between right and left tyrants - and sometimes it feels more like a zero degree movie than a release. May be?
