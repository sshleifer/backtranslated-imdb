I do not see what everyone else liked in this movie. The set-up was too long, and when it was done, the main character remained as flat and opaque as he had been in the first scene. After the movie finally got Cusack into the hotel room of the same name, I had to wonder, well, what's going to happen here for the next hour to keep me engaged. The answer: not much, just John Cusack having a long mental breakdown. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Cusack's character had more depth. . perhaps if his freak-out were a more complete restatement of his daily life. . . perhaps if the film had better developed its semi-elaborate themes about loss and faith or had not put them first. . . perhaps if the movie had made the choice of being a psychological horror or thrilling suspense and had completely adopted one of these styles. . . Do not know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other horror fans and none of us really liked it. <br /> <br /> Except for the haunting episode at the edge of the hotel, the scary crazy lady with the hammer, and the crypt guardian so stupid and fun in the air duct, the three responsible for no more than five minutes of screen time, this movie was annoying. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here for a much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas from himself?
