Hmmm, a sports team is in a plane crash, is stranded on a snowy mountain and faces the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead comrades to survive. Sound familiar to anyone? I mean the "Alive" of 1993. The only big difference here, of course, is that a big, white, scared raven of a Yeti appears a few times to get rid of the dead. I think humans have a better taste than yaks. Stupid: The man in the first scene does not have a reliable gun when he hunts the Yeti, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely false. It would have exploded in the air, exploded when hit the ground or become obliterated. People would not have survived, but hey, it's science fiction. <br /> Stupid: They survived and are cold. It may be a good idea to take advantage of some of the nearby burning debris so you do not freeze to death. Fire being hot as it is ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The rider has ice formed all over his face while he is alive and talking but strangely, no one else does. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the boys tells the others to look for matches and lighters, but there are sparse parts of the plane ablaze around them. Stupid: They find jackets and sweatshirts, and yet in the cold of the Himalayas, they can not wear the hoodies! Stupid: They're looking at a pile of twigs when, I repeat, there are bits of the airplane ALREADY BURNING. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are notorious for their storms. It would be common sense for them to collect the debris to reinforce their structure, rather than sitting outside their quarrels. There are many pine trees nearby, whose branches are excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: When in doubt, use a dead man's arm as a splint. WTF: If the guy knows so much about the hibernating habits of squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, then why does not he know enough to make shelters and traps from the start? <br /> <br /> Stupid: When trying to trap wild animals, irrational talk in the vicinity of the trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen meat? corpse with a piece of glass? <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two were defenseless. The Yeti tore the guy's heart out and stepped on the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. There is love. <br /> <br /> So two Yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever ... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues in more idiocy, but most of the action takes place in the last 15 minutes as usual. Good thinking with the dart and the chain, although this is some ingenuity (with the current that looks magical) that they did not have at the beginning of the movie, when they could not even make fire despite the fact that it was around them. As is typical of Sci-Fi originals, the couple's loving kisses at the end, as nothing horrible, have just happened to them (not to mention they ate human flesh and did not brush their teeth in several days). ). <br /> <br /> The end, however, is to quote lame.
