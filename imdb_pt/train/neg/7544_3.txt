First this movie was not so bad. It was fun ... at least for me, probably for all the wrong reasons. I've never seen the original so I can not compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of Christopher Reeve's strange film, Village of the Damned. The two films have different plots but this creepy nasty feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both. <br /> <br /> Wicker man is supposed to be a mystery / thriller / men please do not annoy the women movie. I do not know the whole pagan thing and the sacrifice was a little off. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his glorious evil self, goes to an isolated island called Summerisle when he receives a calligraphic letter from his long lost bride. who claims that his daughter was taken and hidden by other islanders. <br /> <br /> Cage is a cop and being the police officer tired he is he goes to the semi unknown island leaving no word of his whereabouts to whoever is located in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things get weirder when the big Amish-esquires who populate the island scream at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. Your bride is not a help that seems elusive and tired all the time. Cage sits on the island when he discovers that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man cheated to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the sick festival of the islands harvest. <br /> <br /> In this film, males do not do so well. A display of distorted feminism? <br /> <br /> I found the film ridiculous at times, particularly when the cage punched some women and ran around a bear costume. I think there were a lot of holes in this movie. I think the whole concept of raging women isolating themselves on an island without any care for males is a lot of fun, but the way it was portrayed in that movie was just weird. While most women have had some idiot injured and irritated them, this is clearly a form of sexism. I would have given up the film if the roles were reversed. This movie is something to watch, maybe just once or twice. It's not a thriller that should be categorized as just weird.
