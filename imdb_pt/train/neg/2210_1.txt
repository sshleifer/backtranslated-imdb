This was a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> All 1 in the movie were trying to be serious, that's what made this movie so funny. I mean, come the head of a shark in a human body. It can get funnier. Good Sci-Fi work keep the comedy movies coming. I never thought movies could get any more retarded. If they continue, they'll have to rename the sci-fi channel of the science fiction channel or something. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next blockbuster science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Ill be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and ill be ready to laugh it again !!!
