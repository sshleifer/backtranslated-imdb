Unless you're already familiar with the pop stars who star in this movie, save yourself time and stop reading this review after reaching the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> FORGET THE MOVIE NEVER MISSED AND GO TO WATCH SOMETHING ELSE. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /> <br /> Lanky vehicle to the Japanese teen idol cute boys with an absurd and complicated plot that creeps for an unbearable time until you Be ready to scream. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie makes sense. It is an endless series of people expressing various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously, we can see that something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we just do not give a crap because there is no story behind. <br /> <br /> When the movie is over, you will become sick and tired. these stupid, thin, feminine faces. You will be disgusted to have spent all this time watching them smile, disdain, cry, look mysterious, be "serious" and any other meaningless expression they stamp on their faces. <br /> <br /> What some idiot would ever go so far as to refer to this tasteless piece of garbage as the "soul" of any of their "actors" should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: Only the "converted" lackeys will like this movie, most of them teenagers with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous. Freud would have a field day. <br /> <br /> Unless you're one of those irrational "fans", stay away from this abomination.
