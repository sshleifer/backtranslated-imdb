Can you say that there are some movies that do not have redeeming features? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After directing the terrible director of 'House of the Dead', Uwe Boll cast his less-talented eye for yet another video game adaptation. These guys do not understand? For those who do not understand, here is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE GOOD MOVIES! The performance here is, at best, sub-standard. Scenery design and special effects are bad. Unlike the video game (which has had its scary moments), the film has no atmosphere of impending fate, no sense of danger or threat. Progress and plotting are confusing and the paper on which the script is printed would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Zooms, swoops and hacked pans are inserted throughout the sad subject at unpredictable times, leaving the audience disoriented and bored. Why this guy was never left close to a film set in the first place should be one of the biggest secrets of modern theaters. Avoid at all costs.
