Based on the positive comments above, we saw a free exhibition of this last night. Now I know that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way for an individual to write that. "Intended to become a 'cult classic'" ?? The theater was packed, apparently with friends and family members of the production team, because only a few of us left in the first hour. <br /> <br /> Were the songs the most literal I've ever heard in a musical? "Do not take the shortcut, honey, there's a wolf in the woods ...". Debi Mazar's eyes flashed furiously as she fought to sing. Luckily, most of the songs lasted only a few lines. <br /> <br /> Now, whoever the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive. Instead, we have Joey Fatone, ex-N'Syncer, living up to his last name, since he did not age well. He is not exactly flexible with his extra 50 pounds and his quality composition in high school and out of tune. Seriously, was this guy in the vocal group? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate, but they can not do much about the script without imagination. You know, is it possible to write to adults and children at the same time? see "Pixar". <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the virtual scenarios looked good and were well integrated with the actors. And it was not as offensive as "Crash".
