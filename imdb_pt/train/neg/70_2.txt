This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. For the first time, I should listen to the critics and pass on this. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent training of actors, the film was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought with Bloom, Ledger and Rush, it might have some value. Everyone has done a wonderful job in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie was slow and never pulled me inside. I could not develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to move quickly just to get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you are thinking of renting it just for the purpose of 'eye candy'. It will not satisfy even that.
