God, this movie was so boring beyond the music I really loved, I mean what was the point in actually making this movie, please, anyone reading this review does not watch this movie, it's a waste of time. Emraan may act but it was really pathetic. In this film, I'm really ashamed to be one of your fans, especially in this movie, it was really too bad. Celina is just another pretty little face with no lack of talent, so she can not act, and there was no reason for her to be in this movie, as for the other girl, Radha, she was fine, I think , but could have done better. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time. please buy the good music and do not watch this movie.
