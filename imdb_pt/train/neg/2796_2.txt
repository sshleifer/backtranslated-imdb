for the most part, On Demand offers some horrible horror movies and only offers other horror movies that everyone has already seen and already have an opinion on. It was this, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies), which I did not see, and I was actually in a movie watching mood, which does not happen many more times because I've watched all the movies I own a million times, and that's a lot of movies, and I do not have much interest in new movies, and boy, that movie made me regret it. I'm not going to put spoilers, I'll say that only a few of the few actors in this movie are half decent. I think the lead girl, the dead woman who kills everyone, is very annoying but convincing; I'd take her to a psychopath any day, so she fits well even though it's ridiculous. The blood is not so good, just some of the killings, or I can tell you that "wounds" are fine, but you do not see much and there are no props in the film to make the injuries seem more convincing. By the end of the movie I was begging my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a member of the band, the 'recording' parts were not very interesting either, although what actually happened happened when it came to recording. I already finished, if you want to watch, adapt.
