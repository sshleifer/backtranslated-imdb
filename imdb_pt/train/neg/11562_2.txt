Rich widower Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover and British Lord. He brings sexy red-haired women to his castle, where he whips and kills them. Black-boots stripper Erika Blanc (as Susie) flees temporarily. Mr. Steffen is haunted by his wife "Evelyn", who died in childbirth. As therapy, he decides to marry again, after meeting the beautiful blonde Marina Malfatti (as Gladys). At the end of the movie, they will have to dig a few more graves. "The Night Evelyn Left the Tomb" is a great title, at least. <br /> <br /> Evelyn Usc√¨ dalla Tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
