The '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is laughing at the movie. It is extremely uneven and includes many irritating elements. Take for example the change between black and white and color. If done correctly, this could be reasonably effective, but, as it was poorly done, it became a nuisance and only undermined the already bad experience; much of the film had a strange feel to it. The acting was not extremely bad for a movie made for TV, but then again, it was completely embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent and ended up being confusing. How did this family end up being in many of the great events of the 1960s? The ending was very exaggerated for my taste; because it was hollywood, everything had to work out in the end. I advise you not to waste your time in the 60's and do something else with your time. I'm glad I saw this in class, not in my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. These are just my disconnected thoughts in the movie. I hope you take my advice and stay away from it.
