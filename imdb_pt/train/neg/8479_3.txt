Okay, when I got the picture for this movie, I was really hoping people would make fun of it. I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it. I liked the movie ... but just because me and my little sister (who is actually only 10) mocked the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Jordan, but this performance was awful. You know that a movie is going to the bathroom when the leader can not act. And he did not even have a good script or plan to rescue him. I also thought the character Pamela was very lame ... pathetic on the border. <br /> <br /> Even with that being said, I thought there were some good actors, like the beautiful Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still, it is not enough to rescue the movie. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie that I just can not seem to get over: 1.) That that Spencer guy would fall for her. . Okay, eww. I looked at the dates and while in reality he is only about four years older than her, the difference in "Go Figure" looked much bigger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF, she seemed to be 10 or 12 ... she looked like a child! Jake Abel (Spencer) looked like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) There is some way in which Kristi Yamaguchi would come just to skate for a girl. I mean, I know Katelin is good and all, but it still seems a little unlikely that Kristi went to a boarding school that did not even have skateboard bags, or that a school had hired a skateboard coach with those connections. All that was said ... was not the worst movie of all time, but it was not very good even for DCOM standards, which I consider quite low.
