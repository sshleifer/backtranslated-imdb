Unfortunately, realism is boring. This movie, I thought would never end, would have been better if all the characters had been eliminated in the first five minutes. Where is Blade when you need it? Although as disheartening as COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and as terrifying as BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES is not as much fun as any of the dark movies mentioned above. While free cannibalism could make the aspiring Jeffery Dalmers hearts run a little faster, it was not as interesting as RAVENOUS. Actually, I found it as interesting as late night infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you may be able to endure this, otherwise, to no one. I was really surprised that this was not done by the people of Brain Damage, since it was the quality of Dead Creatures.
