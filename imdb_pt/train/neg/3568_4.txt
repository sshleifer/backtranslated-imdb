The truth is that a movie based on a novel by Harold Robbins will not win any awards. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B image in budget, cast and execution. Technically, it looks like a movie made for TV. The acting is very uneven. Jos√© Cali is especially terrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As a reviewer said about a certain performance of Katherine Hepburn, her range goes from A to B. Ms Zedora manages to reach G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted on their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. Still, the whole thing can be a lot of fun in a half reckless way. As befits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you are looking for fun ... and you are not very sober ... this may be for you.
