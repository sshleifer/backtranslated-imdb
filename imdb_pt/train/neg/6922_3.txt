The leaves and the newspaper campaign suggested (as they used to) a much more sinister and violent piece than the one shown on the drive-in screens. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook, who has worked on films for years. This is very difficult to find more; I would love to see him again to compare him to other international horrors of the day, but I do not remember particularly well when. Chances are it was a fragmented version that hit US movie theaters and videos. But, oh, that leaf ... is still a jewel of my last collection of terror.
