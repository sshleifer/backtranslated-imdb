That was so stupid that I turned off the DVD ... maybe halfway. It was so weak that I could not even pay enough attention to tell him how far I got. Although I really wanted to believe that the representation of young Carlito would be a little different, I just could not buy it. I do not really blame the actors because I think it was the script that may have fallen. I found myself laughing a few times, but I do not think these lines were meant to be funny. <br /> <br /> It's just a saving grace that I bought on a DVD of 2 and I would have paid the price I made for the original alone. This is one of those cases where they should have let the classic stand alone.
