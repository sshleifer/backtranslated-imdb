I'll be frank and to the point. This movie is not good. The cinematographic part of me detested the acting, the script, the story, the direction and almost the whole edition. Amanda Peet proved that she can act, since she was a high point of 'The Whole Nine Yards'. So she should have avoided this movie with a ten-foot pole. However, the children's part of me found this movie very funny. If you can forget how productive the quality is below average, and if you find funny jokes then you should be fine. And for those of you who can not get off your pedestal, that's your choice. My inner child did not die and I laughed a little. Even so, only 3 out of 10 because, like a movie, it really stinks.
