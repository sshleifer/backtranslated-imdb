The movie is bad. Nothing special - just a movie "boy" with no serious thing in it. There is, however, one reason to observe this: the talk about animals. Some of them are so funny in what they say, you just can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in a doggie bag saying "I'm Keyser Soze," or another animal saying "You're a dead cat walking," or many other funny liners, see. Because there is no other good movie to watch. Vote: 4 out of 10.
