Slow, boring, extremely repetitive. No wonder the Weinstein Company did not buy it. This Spurlock must eat more McDonalds while shooting and stop producing. There is no way you can watch and enjoy it. The preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2 minute movie with this idea and not a feature. I'm sorry that I rented this movie. I'll never watch anything with the Spurlock name on it. It's completely rubbish. Filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never receive a distribution agreement. The film claims that American consumers and their purchases are to blame for the current depression when buying and buying products, making money circulate in the system are the basis of a healthy economy.
