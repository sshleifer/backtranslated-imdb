Okay, if you're looking for another Bastetball Diaries, this is the completely wrong movie. <br /> <br /> I spin around two brothers. Max, the youngest, has a major addiction to cocaine. Adam, the eldest, is a doctor. This film is to show the plunge of reality to the extreme limits that drugs make possible. However, this does not happen. This shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation. Most of the film's focus is on Max and his farewell ways. Eventually Adam can no longer take the stress out of his work and starts using it as well (prescribed drugs). <br /> <br /> This movie has almost no climax. It does not go down to what cocaine really does to you, it has boring and low budget scenes, and the acting of the older brother, Adam, is awful. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this movie got to pass and receive awards, not a heart enthusiast. If you want a clear and true story film in the extreme world of drugs, do not buy 'The Basketball Diaries'. And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will like it. Try it and see for yourself ...
