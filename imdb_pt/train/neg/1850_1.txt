Director Ron Atkins is insanely insane. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of a Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a madman who gets a Rubberneck doll from his girlfriend bitch. He begins to take orders from the doll to take large amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts out as a film of exploration of balls-to-wall, well stays that way, but it gets VERY repetitive very fast. I'm leaning more towards the certified insane. It's hard to forget once seen. Like Tom Green did a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My notes: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets completely naked; Jasmin Putnam shows breasts and shrub <br /> <br /> ANTI-eye drops: seeing John completely naked repeatedly
