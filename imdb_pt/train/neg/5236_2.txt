my friends and I have seen this movie for about a week and I feel it is absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who will read this) that this film is not just among the five worst movies I have ever seen, but in fact has the honor of being number one. I've seen a lot of movies, but none of them are stupid. you could say that I suffered watching ... my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and we were not able to go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks. I would not recommend this to anyone. At first I thought we were watching a really bad porn movie, but found out after 10 minutes that's not the case. it's not a comedy, it's not drama, it's not action, it's not horror, it's just awful!
