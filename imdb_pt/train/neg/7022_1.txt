In over 70 years watching movies, this must be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others have done some very bad comedies, this, however, is the absolute bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> It's bland from the very opening up to the scene mended during the credits. Diane Keaton, whom I normally like, must have needed her salary a lot. She desperately needs to relearn her craft. <br /> Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is), needs a better director, to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler also does not measure up to her role. <br /> <br /> Mike White needs to find another character, he made that same kind of person a few times over. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard, who started years ago as a top notch actor, also not as good as he used to be. <br /> <br /> There's nothing decent I can say about this movie comedy attempt.
