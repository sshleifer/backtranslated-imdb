I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, which I had not seen in any movie since Rocky IV. Unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment. The acting of all parties was bad, except for Mr. Lundgren, who was well. Kata Dob√≥ was cool to see, despite his ridiculous clothes and makeup. <br /> <br /> The plot is not clever, it has been repeated millions of times in different films. The bandits were totally stereotyped, and Lundgren's character had no depth in it. I really did not expect a masterpiece from the movie, but unfortunately this is not a decent action. Each turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of exaggerated unrealism and comic book-like characters began to bother me very soon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this to small children wanting something. comic action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by someone involved in making this movie)
