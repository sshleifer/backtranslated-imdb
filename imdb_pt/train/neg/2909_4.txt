Watching Tom Hanks as a hit for the Irish Mafia is a bit like watching Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist that just does not work. I really had a hard time accepting this. Not that I do not think Tom can not act, he may have pursued his career from Labyrinths and Monsters, but for some reason that was not easy for me. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and run the risk of sounding like a fanboy (the only way of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach). The film as a whole fails me. The additions of Jude Law, and the subtractions the rest left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a big crime movie more in Bonnie's vein and Clyde Mendes took the whole heart out of the story and left us with nothing but bones. There are things to like in this movie however the cinematography is breathtaking fill the screen with beautiful pictures Paul Newman is as always excellent and I really enjoyed the punctuation, but Tom as "the angel of death" Sullivan was completely flat.
