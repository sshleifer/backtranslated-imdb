What a terrible movie. The acting was bad, the pace was bad, the cinematography was bad, the direction was bad, the "special" effects were bad. You expect a degree of evil in a slasher, but even the murders were bad. <br /> <br /> First, the last event that established the reason for the slaughter lasted 15 or 20 minutes. I thought this would never end. They could have removed 80% and explained what happened well enough. <br /> <br /> Then the victims were invited to the "meeting" at an abandoned school that still had all utilities attached. One of the victims thought this was a bit strange, but they rejected it and decided to come in anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the murders were so false that they could hardly be found. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to watch this movie unless you want to see some breasts, not really good breasts. This movie makes Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
