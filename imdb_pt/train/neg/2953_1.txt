These reviews that claim that this movie is so bad that it's good are going too much overboard with this movie. This movie does not have the evil of guilty pleasure that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. These movies were fun in their horror, but this pile of dinosaur manure is so bad it's painful. I have not felt much pain watching a bad movie since I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before you begin the review, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust that New Line Cinema has refused to put in theaters. They cut the losses by sending them directly to the video, making it the most direct-to-expensive video movie in decades. Whoopi gave in to be in this disaster after a huge salary. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A millionaire clone dinosaurs so he can launch missiles into the sun that would kill humanity and start another ice age. A cop named Katie Coltrane and an idiot named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a dinosaur. <br /> <br /> The plot is given to you at the beginning of the movie, which steals the film from all its mystery. So you have to deal with the fact that this movie is really horrible. Whoopi seems agitated and is trying to accompany him with his performance, but to no avail. Theodore Rex is annoying and his clumsy behavior wears off after five minutes on the screen. Most jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hit people with the tail (by accident and on purpose). I thought Burglar was bad, but it stayed in the background with Theodore Rex: the worst movie in Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone say that this monstrosity is bad enough to be nice. I did not see it when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people who must have had some unhealthy admiration for the movie Howard The Duck. The mood is at that level and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's innate cousin. Totally painful from start to finish.
