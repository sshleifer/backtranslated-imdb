Listening to the director's comment confirmed what I suspected while watching the film: this is a movie made by a guy who wants to make a movie. The plot is the kind of thing the deluded teens do when they're going through the "I could write an award-winning book / script / sitcom" phase. There's a germ of an interesting idea buried there (probably because it's a continuation of someone else's movie), but it's totally buried under a underwritten, ill-executed and ridiculously thought-provoking script. <br /> <br /> The lines are terrible, and the performances are uninteresting, although, again, I'm inclined to blame the director. He did not seem to have consulted the actors about what was needed; instead, he put the script in his hands, pointed the camera at them and told them to move on. Who knows, with a little training, these actors could have gotten better acquitted (say what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent at Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man). <br /> /> As it stands, the cast has no chemistry whatsoever. A beautiful opportunity to use the classic parallel of sex and vampirism is passed on when, to infect the Bon Jovi character with vampire blood from his sick co-hunter, he receives a transfusion. She should have bitten him. Remember, they should have become vaguely interested in the rest of the movie as well. The only real moment of sexual tension, between the two female leaders, is by the very admission of the directors accidentally. He originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for a more meaningless plot exposition - so I suppose the finished product could have been worse. But not much. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as the films go, this is badly planned, silly and forgetful. Even with the useless movies, it's not sexy or bloody enough to be fun. It could have been a fun and bloody joke, but the director left with more than one comedy, for all the wrong reasons.
