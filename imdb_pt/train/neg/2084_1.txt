if they gave me the option of negative numbers, I would use them. This movie was really awful. I walked into theaters expecting it to be horrible, and somehow it exceeded my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, the acting was painful. I wanted to leave, but my friend was driving and I wanted her money to be worth it, I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> The growth of the breasts when the girls got their super power and the hair change the color was wrong. Eddie Izzard looked just wrong for the role of super villain, he was strangely weak and silly. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came out psychotic and weird, as did Matt's friend (Luke Wilson), Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.
