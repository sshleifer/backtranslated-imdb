One of Scorsese's worst. A common thriller; The only thing to recommend is De Niro playing the psychopath. The ending is typically of that genre, that is, exaggerated, with another villain immune to almost invincible pain. I did not like the originals of the 60's, and this version was not much better than that. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake. So again, considering how bad your recent movies were (I'm referring to your dull Buddhist movie and all those with your favorite new actress, blonde girl Di Caprio) this is not even so bad in comparison. And considering Spielberg wanted to do the remake ... it could have been much worse.
