I was very unhappy with this move. Everything was terrible from the start. The comedy was non-humorous, the action exaggerated, the songs without melodies. Even the plot was weightless. From a writer who wrote successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations. The actors worked very hard and did not help the film. Of course, Kareena swung the bikini canvas, but for two seconds. I think stunt directors should research how action movies are made. They tend to overdo it too much. In Chinese movies, this style works because that's your signature. But, the signature of Hindi cinema are the songs. A good action movie should not last more than two hours and can not seem unrealistic. But in the future, I'm sure these action movies will be sharper. It should also be noted: Comedy and action movies do not mix unless they are done properly. Good luck next time.
