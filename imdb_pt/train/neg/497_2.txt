This is a silent movie. It could be fun with the cool aliens and the country setting, but it just is not. <br /> <br /> Some aliens hear the War of the Worlds broadcast when a small country radio station plays on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act foolishly. The movie cover shows these aliens riding surfboards in space ... not exactly what they do. These are not party aliens, they are stupid cartoon idiots with high frequency frequency modulating irritating voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice is also the extraterrestrial Jack Nicholson, who always wears sunglasses. Besides the aliens, the acting is terrible. Writing is obviously meant for kids, because each character is written like a child. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid movie, which only kids will enjoy, maybe. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of **** 100 min. PG for light language.
