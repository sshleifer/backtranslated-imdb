When young Kevin receives the boat from his dead uncle as a gift, he invites five of his friends to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. During the trip, they drink alcohol, have sex and play with each of them saying their greatest fear. Later, Kevin drowns in the open sea, the motor stops, and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest fear. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends came together to watch "Haunted Boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes of length, the group gave up watching this crap and boring amateurish crap, and we decided to watch another movie. Later I decided to watch the rest of the movie to see just how bad it could be and would have been better off going to bed to sleep. The confusing story has a horrible cinematography and camera work, with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this movie seems like a bad movie school project. The terrible and pretentious script shows a ridiculous turnaround in the end, actually a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is all about. Was the girl crazy and traveled alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? If this is true, are your friends again in the end fruit of your madness? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Journey to Death" ("Journey to Death")
