This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen ... it's funny how bad it is ... the whole time I was watching, I kind of hoped the music would start and the doctor started to dance ... (I saw the porn with a better plot) When the raptor was trying to get in the door I think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door about 2 meters away. But as I said, it is so bad that you need to watch so you can see how bad it is for me to explain that it will not do anything compared to if you watch it .. I do not recommend renting it, but if it comes in TV and watch for about 30min just to see what I mean. I could not watch more than 30min, but if you can sit with the whole thing, then you have a good will power
