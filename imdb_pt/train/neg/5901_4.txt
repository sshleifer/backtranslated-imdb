Something to sing about was produced at Grand National Studios where James Cagney was working while under a contractual dispute with the Warner Brothers. He made two films for this B studio, none of which ranks high on Cagney's credits. <br /> <br /> One of the big losses to the movies is the fact that Jimmy Cagney made so few movies that used his incredible dance skills. . The two that come to mind immediately are Yankee Dandy Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two smaller films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he never used to watch anything but his musicals in retirement. So why did he make so few of them? <br /> <br /> Well, this was all wrong. The plot of Something to Sing About refers to a hoofer who leads a band that discovered and gave a film contract. There are the usual complications of a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent respectively played and well by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. Her contract calls for a no-marriage clause, so Cagney and band singer Evelyn Daw marry in secret. So we have the complication of an advertising-driven studio novel with the screen's protagonist, Mona Barrie. I think you can figure out where this is going to happen. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about Something to Sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and end of the movie and nothing in between. Evelyn Daw had a pleasant voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich. She got the musical numbers as they were. I'm sure the movie audience was paying their tickets to see Cagney's ball. <br /> <br /> In addition to giving her some dance numbers, a female dance partner would have been nice. He danced well with Ruby Keeler in Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day in The West Point Story. Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler were not available? <br /> <br /> No memorable music came out of it. And Daw's voice is also on the waist. She has a voice of soprano Jeanette MacDonald who was so out of place with a swing band. <br /> <br /> No wonder Cagney ran back to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him some decent musicals.
