The trio of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play the movie "Coney Island Carnys" vying for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a girl who sells saltwater taffy. With the outbreak of World War I, the trio enlisted and chases Ginger from afar. The first half of this RKO Pathe production is difficult, with the three male leaders chewing the stage with an overcooked filling and a "fast" dialogue that quickly becomes tiring. The second part focuses on action sequences, as the US Navy pursues a German merchant cruiser and a submarine. These sequences are animated and well filmed, but overall, it's an unreasonable and excessive dramatic comedy with a flat ending. For fans of the stars only.
