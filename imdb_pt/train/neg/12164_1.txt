This movie is not good. The first one almost sucked, but it had that unreal ending to make it worth watching. This one has nothing. There is zero fright, zero tension or suspense. This is not really a horror movie. I do not show anything. There is nothing to say about it. It could be almost a TV, except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence. The acting is not very good either. And do not make me start dialog.as for the final surprise, surprise, there is not one. I suppose it could have been worse, though I did not see how. But then again, she got less than 80 minutes, so I guess that's a good thing. Though she felt much longer. apparently this is the cut version of the movie. I found it for a very cheap price but still not worth it. If you want the most uncut graphic version, check out the edition of Anchor Bay. Anyway, this version of Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy campers get a 1/10 fat from me. If you watch this movie, you'll probably be a bored and unhappy camper. If you're a fan, you might want to grab the Anchor Bay Sleepaway Camp (with survival kit) with three disc collections containing the first three uncut movies. special features
