If this movie were worse, it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This meaningless mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been a while since I've seen this steaming pile, but I remember that I wanted to cause serious bodily harm to everyone involved. How one can give this film more than a star surprises me with the kindness of all those who have seen this nonsense. I give a star because there is not a lower rating. All copies of this film should be burned in the soil sown with salt and set aside as a landfill for the most toxic waste. No, a copy should be kept ultra hi safe and shown only to filmmakers as an example of how not to do this.
