I like monster movies, usually. Even though they are implausible and silly. But it's hard to like this movie when it's so implausible and silly and tries to take it seriously at the same time. Like in a really fancy way. Although the idea is a bit factual, as orcas are known to kill Great White Sharks, it's really hard to find it scary when I can not avoid an angry Shamoo destroying things. Especially that scene where some building exploded because the Orca is ... and as it explodes, it jumps out of the water and it looks like I was watching a Sea World show with fireworks. In addition, they kill many of the scary moments before even suggesting that they will happen. In addition, some jabs are needed in JAWS. It's like, "Look, we're being factual and we can come up with the BEST reasons why Orca is attacking." <br /> <br /> Yes, ignoring their absurd errors in logic, of course. But JAWS had one thing their movie does not have. That's scary. Yes, it's implausible. Yeah, it's a bit outrageous. But frankly, factual or not, a killer shark is not close to being as scary as a Great White. And the poor character development and writing attempt only hurts him more. Even JAWS the Revenge is scarier than that.
