I should have listened. I was warned, and yet I paid money for it, after reading all the reviews, after knowing that the original is "so bad it's good", and that part 2 does not fit that category, yet I could not resist . Exactly what happened here? Part one was hilarious, it was so politically incorrect, and another crazy, Fat Entertainment, and this, there could not be a worse continuation on God's green land, not in the case of basket 2, hell, not even in Troll 2. is truly the worst sequel in the history and this is actually saying something considering the innovative, barrel-like qualities of the original. Criminally insane part 2 was just a completely different brand from bad. Shot on video, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original, and on top of it all, crazy, fat Ethel has lost a part of its circumference. I mean, honestly, is this some kind of bad joke? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
