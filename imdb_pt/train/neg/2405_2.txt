This movie deserved a job at the Mystery Science Theater. Even if it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth watching it because it is an unintentional riot. Same! It's worse than "Destroy all monsters". Be sure to check out the following: the cheese medallion (looks like the Shriners were here), the obviously Norfolk polyester jacket on "Allan Quatermain," the bad stuttering stench of David MaCallum (who catches the eye of his worst acting) , the incredibly bad process works on all "monsters," the monsters themselves - the hand puppet that threatens the little girl, the giant snake that threatens Macallum as he sinks into the oats, red eyes on motorized crabs, the incredibly hilarious boat oh, brother !!) that seems to be made out of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a Jr.Sr. The Phoenician city - where they wear Roman imperial armor, but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (Phoenicians invented the alphabet - come on!), and the worst of everything, Macallum and Ekland (with his scared wig) playing with kisses-oh horror! The best part is that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the humorous French, and the African man - the nenuleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically instead of being in more scenes.
