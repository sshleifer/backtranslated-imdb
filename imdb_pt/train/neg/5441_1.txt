Of all the movies I've seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, logic, continuity, changes in the plot, script and dialogue made me cry with pain. "How could anyone get to such a bad thing?" Gary Busey is known for his "B" movies, but this is definitely a "W" movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take for example: about two dozen FBI agents and local law surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the Jeep is MA and it's "confusing" why all the cops are concerned. Within seconds, a huge firefight takes place, MA being killed immediately. The cops explode in the jeep with Gary and company shooting at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary walks in circles and is not hit by a single bullet / pellet. MA is dead and Gary seems not to have noticed that the guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.
