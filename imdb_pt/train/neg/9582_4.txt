This piece of accumulated fecal matter joins so many ridiculous scenarios that in the end it's a laugh of absolute hilarity. It is a pity that the premise is promising (as so often happens in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this writer she goes to la land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison serving time for a DUI that killed his lover. We see him having nightmares just so we know he feels really bad about it. Then your fellow cell neighbor hangs himself. Or him? Lowe has some suspicions, but he drops them quickly. Their suspicions are so weak that thieves have nothing to worry about. So why do they then put you to be killed? Ah, that's where this story can get interesting. That's when he falls off the rails, and once off the rails, he decides he can get away with insulting the viewers' attention for the next numbing hour. ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** I will not bore you with an endless recount of the irrationality of what follows, but contemplate that end. Lowe was arrested by the bad guys on a train. They want a tape that he has, because this tape will ruin his boss and them. Then, on the train, come 3 armed policemen, ready to rescue Lowe. The bandits kill the cops, in front of half the passengers and then ... continue to chase Lowe to get the tape. HELLO!!!! killing 3 policemen in public will take you to the bottom of hell, to hell with the tape. However, they pass by a mall, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and in the end, Lowe is caught and the bad guy still wants the tape !!!
