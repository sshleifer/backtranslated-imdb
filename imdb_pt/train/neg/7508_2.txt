I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film. "Summer of Sam" conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz. It is not. It is a bold and grounded portrait of life on the streets of New York during the hot summer of 1977, when Berkowitz terrorized the city. The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian-American neighborhood, and their reactions to Sam's Son threaten. There is Vinny and his wife Dionna; there are Richie and Ruby, and several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not nice. They are routinely irritating and sometimes unbearable. Lee then believes in their chaotic, energy-filled lives, filled with anger, lust, and general excitement. There are at least two lengthy fight scenes between Vinny and his wife, redundant disco dancing scenes, innumerable gabfests ... More and more I kept wondering: where is the movie editor? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with all of this volume, the film misses the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread that comes from the threat of Sam's Son, which is too much in the background. Lee is more successful in showing a different kind of threat, which comes from neighborhood watchdog groups. <br /> <br /> The performance is uniformly good. This, combined with the disco music of the 70s, and generous attention to costumes and production design, makes you feel as if you were in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York in 1977. <br /> <br /> Authenticity atmospheric film, however, is not enough to compensate for an exaggerated and exaggerated script about the lives of people who cause irritation.
