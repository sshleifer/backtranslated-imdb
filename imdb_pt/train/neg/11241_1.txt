If you are looking for eye drops, you may like the Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game injected with live artists. Visions are cool and interesting to see all through the movie. Now, saying that, the look is the ONLY good thing about Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I knew that I was watching one of the worst movies of all time. I hoped this movie would improve, but it never reached any degree of interest. After thirty minutes, the desire to leave continued to grow and grow. Now, I own more than 2000 movies and I've probably seen five times that number. However, this is only the second film that I felt like leaving my whole life. <br /> <br /> Acting --- there is none. The three main artists are regrettable. Jude Law (also in the other film I wanted to leave) is horrible in the title role. I'd rather sit with Ben Affleck in Gigli than watch Law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow tries so hard to be exaggerated, that it backfires in her face. The last article I read said that Paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother instead of acting. After this performance, I applaud that decision. <br /> <br /> History --- Novels are better written. The story behind Captain Sky begins badly and gets worse and worse as he advances. <br /> <br /> Direction --- none. Everything was put into the special effects that story, acting and driving suffer a lot. Even "The Phantom Menace" had better acting and that's NOT saying much. <br /> <br /> I would have to give this movie a "0" of "10". Avoid paying the theater prices and wait until the video is released.
