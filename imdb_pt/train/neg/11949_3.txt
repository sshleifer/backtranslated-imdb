This stupid comedy really does a good job wasting comedic talents. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused here. I might have laughed once or twice during this movie, but overall, it's a boring movie with a bit of foolishness thrown in for good measure. The premise, although routine, was still not bad, but once the plot was set, the film did not come to anything. Do not waste your time with this misfire.
