I do not know who Sue Kramer is, the director of the film, but I have a strong suspicion that: A) she is a lesbian and B) she has somehow embarrassed everyone involved in this project to prove they are not homophobic. I can imagine everyone thinking, "Oh my God, that's awful. But keeping their mouths closed for fear, they will be labeled as anti-gay or "do not understand" the gay lifestyle. (That's probably why Kramer did NOT launch gays to play gay people as well.) Anyway, neither is it worth checking out. The actors are all directed to play each scene completely over, so that there is no sincerity or credibility in anything they do. It's full of clich√©s and there's nothing about this movie that is the least entertaining - much less funny. <br /> <br /> I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. Too bad the cowardly people who gave Kramer the money to manufacture this bomb were not as impartial in their judgment.
