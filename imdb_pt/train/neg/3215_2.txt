The film has a nudity scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed, his genitals exposed right in the middle of the screen. It's a pretty long scene. What was the point? I almost think this was meant to be funny, but we were watching with my mom and it was not funny to have it looking at us for what seemed like a whole minute. <br /> <br /> The movie is cold. None of the characters are nice. Audrey Tatou is cute, of course, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I really would not recommend this movie. I expected it to be charming and fresh, but it was depressing. I wondered if the director was from a much higher family, an educated French family and he despised these characters. <br /> <br />
