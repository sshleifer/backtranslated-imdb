When the movie begins, a narrator tells us: THE SCREAMING SKULL is so terrifying that you can die of fear - and if this happens, a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I do not think anyone has died scared to see this movie, but some may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is the kind of movie that makes Ed Wood look good. Very loosely based on the famous story of Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL is about a rich but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died in mysterious circumstances. Once installed in her home, she is plagued by a bland gardener, a poorly executed portrait, peacocks, and finally a skull that rolls around the room and makes her scream a lot. And to her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams really well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, your ability to do this is the highlight of the movie. The plot is quite transparent, to say the least, and while the cast is really well, the script is terrible and the film so uninspired that you will be ready to run screaming alone. It is true that the thing only lasts about sixty-eight minutes, but everything seems much longer. Add to that a truly terrible print quality and you are here. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are so bad that they are fun to watch. It's true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few screams - but the movie drags so much that I get no more than an occasional laugh, and when the whole thing is over, your head will roll with boredom. If it were not for Peggy Webber's way with a scream, that would be the right cure for insomnia. Do not miss. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
