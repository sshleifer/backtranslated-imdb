I did not expect much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a Miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I get the impression that the director / writer is just playing with the audience: "Let me see how much emptiness you can sustain." The dialogues are empty ... the scenery is minimalist. At times, photography is really cool. Few sarcastic lines are kind of funny, but it's hard to really laugh during this "comedy." I laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end. If you can rise above the fiasco of this director, you will find good performances of some legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and very good performance of Emir's son, Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In short: too bad for such a good director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should be making high quality films. Instead, he chooses to make this low-budget theater movie, just for my private, with an arrogant attitude toward world trends and neglect of his former fans.
