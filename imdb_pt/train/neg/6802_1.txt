Words can not describe how bad this movie is. I can not explain this by writing alone. You also saw this on your own as a movie really can be awful. Not that I recommend you do it. There are so many clich√©s, mistakes (and all the other negative things you can imagine) here that will only make you cry. To start with the first technician, there are many mistakes regarding the plane. I will not list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They were not even able to show off a passenger plane in the colors of a fictional airline but instead used a 747 painted with the original Boeing paint. Very bad. The plot is stupid and was done many times before, just much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that I lost count too soon. Besides, I was on the bad guys side all the time in the movie because the good guys were so stupid. "Executive Decision" should undoubtedly be your choice over this, even the "Turbulence" - the films are better. In fact, all the other films in the world are better than this.
