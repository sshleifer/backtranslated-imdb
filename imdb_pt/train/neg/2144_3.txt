I always thought Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen, followed by Peter Pan 2 and a few other sequences like The Lion King 2 and Hunchback of Notre Dame 2. All these films are made with the same idea; because the movie has no plot, they try to make up for it by stuffing it with jokes. I'm not saying jokes are bad, but they make up the bulk of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most kids do not care how the original movie was good, they just care that the movie is fun. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that does not mean it's awful. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.
