Not even Goebbels could have gotten a propaganda stroke like Gore did with this whole piece of fiction. This is a study on how numbers and statistics can be turned to say what you predetermined them to say. The "scientists" Gore said have signed the validity of global warming include social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. Would you say that a meteorologist specializes in neuro-surgery? Field survey geologists and data analysis are involved in not supporting Gore's alarmist claims of global warming. As one of these geologists working in the field over the past 40 years, I have not seen any evidence to support global warming. My analysis of this film and Gore's actions over the last two years leads me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of remaining important and relevant. Neither more nor less. Ask any global warming alarmist or "journalist" a simple question - You say that global warming is a big problem. Tell me. What temperature should Earth have?
