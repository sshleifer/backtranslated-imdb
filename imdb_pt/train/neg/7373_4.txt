I do not know what the rest of you watch Steven Seagal's movies, but I watch them because, as foolish as they are, they're always good to laugh at. Why would you rate this movie 1 in 10 based on dubbing when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like that in a cult favorite that you can laugh at the nonsense of? The Attack Force is by no means a great movie, but I felt it was as worthy of a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other films; in fact, I did not think it was one of his worst moments. Most of the time, he had a coherent plot in the middle of the road and, for the most part, was fundamentally exciting. The ending really sucked, but even that had some pleasantly useless elements. In the end, the story itself did not deliver, but I actually thought the interpretation, the characterization (if I could use such a big word) and the rest of the production values ​​delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect Seagal himself, in particular, was exactly the man of the stone-faced, sensible man we had come to expect, and the rest of the cast supported him very well, never preparing him. That, folks, is what makes a Steven Seagal movie. Deal with it. Or better yet: laugh at it. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
