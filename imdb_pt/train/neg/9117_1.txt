... or maybe it's so bad. The plot is a cheap reprint of the first, which is strange, since it is supposed to be a prequel, not a continuation. Almost the whole movie looks like a cheap remake of the first, with scenes that mimic the things that happened in the first, just far more ridiculous and improbable. Where the former had a large cast, this consists of list B actors and rejections. The acting is horrendously bad. Half of the movie's good lines are taken directly from the first, as well as almost all the main characters, including those who were not in the first movie. I realize this was done for a pilot episode of the TV series, but that's no excuse. They did not have to turn the (bad) footage into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good and the erotic sequences. However, as these are by no means as good as the first, even if this is not raising you above a rating of 1. If you have the opportunity to see it for free, and if you are a straight guy, it could be worth Worth checking, if you want something erotic that is not porn. If not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
