I try to be very objective when I see a low budget movie. I also apply a lower weight for independent and low budget productions compared to large budget productions. I expect almost perfection from big budget productions and their studios. That's why I apply tougher criteria to major studio releases. But this movie was just a failure. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was unbelievable as a schoolboy with an insatiable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in his character or his acting that took him to her world. In addition, to make this movie more mysterious, lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Again another disappointing movie that I could only give three points.
