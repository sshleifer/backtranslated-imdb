This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and renaming. It does not work at all. In the first place, the dramaturgy is wrong. It is very slow at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end. But there is also (and this may have to do with the cuts) a restless movement between genders. It starts with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the ending may be funny, but it's also so blunt that I almost felt insults to my intelligence (how little there is). So the movie tries to be everything, but it does not succeed on any level. You can also see this in the development of very unstable character. You almost have the impression that Connery plays three roles instead of one.
