I've been watching a lot of cartoons or animation films because I have a girl who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if I would like my son to watch ... and no. At first I thought it was a movie as cute as the movie Bambi, but all the way was how to insinuate that the duckling was homosexual. The information said they were mocking him because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It just seems like a movie made for kids to learn how to look good being gay. It was also very sad, as was the duckling's father and everything. I do not know, I think if you're gay you'd like, but I do not think I'll watch again with my little one.
