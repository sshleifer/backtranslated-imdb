This movie was a disaster from beginning to end. Interweaved with performances by "the next generation of handsome losers" are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the artists themselves. This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who dominates everyone else in the film with his gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St. Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are overly forgetful interpretations (especially those of Rufus and Martha Wainright) or insignificant. Only Beth Orton and Anthony were within walking distance of Leonard's own versions using a little restraint. Little annoying pseudo-avant-garde gestures are scattered throughout the film - such as red-ball overlays in many of the shows and interviews, camera blurring, use of digital delay in some comments by Leonard Cohen (making it harder to hear what is being said) and a scary and pretentious bass drone in many segments of the interview (an attempt to add gravitas?). For the real thing, see the documentary Songs From The Life Of, produced by the BBC in 1988.
