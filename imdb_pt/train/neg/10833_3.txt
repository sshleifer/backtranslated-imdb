I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that come together at the end, but Magnolia made a wrong turn in the middle of the movie and I was lost. I almost hung up and then there, but I felt I should stay there until the end, little did I know it would be another torturous half hour. Thank God I rented instead of seeing him in the theater. I almost screamed in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the frog's final scene. My DVD still has not forgiven me and I do not blame it at all. It was a unique movie, but a bad movie, boring and meaningless.
