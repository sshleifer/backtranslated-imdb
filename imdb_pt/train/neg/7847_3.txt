Recently, I have been obsessed and anticipated so much this movie that I almost had to see. Well, having just seen it today, the 5.8 rating is completely understandable. I think if you anticipate something that becomes an extreme need, it turns out to be not worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very cool and well-developed storyline that blends well with the product itself, but the whole thing is so selfish that it becomes so hard to follow. And if it were not for the production of Wes Craven in this movie, it would have nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing makes you go "Is this to be horror or COMEDY?" because there are lots of ridiculous moments, randomly placed in a jump and stupid liners (IE "There's a hand in the shit!" or "You're the mother! I'm going to kill you all, damn sons of lesbians!") God does not even remember how bad it was. <br /> <br /> HISTORY: (this part contains spoilers, watch out!) The movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby (ooh la la!), And then screen goes black with the title of the movie appearing, and a monologue.Then we go to that office where there are randomly placed veteran mannequins.We think this is for this scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants.The box to follow the audio feeds are gone, and everyone dies! <br /> <br /> After that tone opening, you'd expect more. <br /> <br /> So, we're going to this unique team of military recruits training in Baghdad. "A good job in stupidity", his last day of training is in Nov Mexico, the desert where the family in the last THHE had stayed beca use they were trapped. While training, things go wrong, people die and ... need I say anything else? Because now I have the attention of a goldfish just forcing me to sit here and type this. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with THHE2 is that it just does not work. There are no flashbacks here, and the end is pretty safe ... but with a twist! An idiot, that is. I'm sure the Ultra Super Director's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket for The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all the alternate endings, but at this point I'm not sure I care. <br /> <br /> So, by all means, if you loved the first so much, it is almost a sin not to see it, so by all means, see it. But if more then avoid at all costs. It's for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
