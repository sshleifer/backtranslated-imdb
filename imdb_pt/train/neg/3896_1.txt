Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule, commenting that "you did not live until you saw the sun through the rings of Saturn," while the obvious noon light enters through the window, when suddenly it has a bleeding nose. Then West is back in some secret hospital, a molten gelatinous mass that drives him crazy and makes a stout nurse run through a fake glass door. Apparently, West "gets stronger as it melts," which makes as much sense as anything in this irremediably purle and adle-brained moovie. So this dopey "Army Brass", which looks like Coleman Francis (director of many bad moovies) tries to cover the information, but the man enjoys running killing everyone he sees because he is melting. He attacks an old quarreling couple because it's melting. It makes a terrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minutes because it is melting. It's melting because it's melting. The fx by slumming Rick Baker is supposed to be the star here, but they just seem mushy. The film is poorly filmed and everything seems so gloomy and confusing that it is very difficult to understand what it is - not that this helps anyone. MooCow says who cut the cheese with this? : = 8P ps - "You did not get cookies?"
