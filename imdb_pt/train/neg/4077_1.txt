What do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are painfully long, terrible lighting, painful editing and terrible effects? You start Jessica: A Ghost Story It seems your photo is on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to complement this medium. In this case, this does not happen. There are some UCs where the face of the person is totally in the shade. One scene in particular is the scene of psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half ... but I do not think they would have a movie the length of the movie. The main character is incredibly flat. He is the LEAD male, so he must have some "hero" elements in his character, but he does not. He whimpers and is scared of the whole movie. I could go on, but I do not wanna waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say they had a good camera movement. Too bad the lighting did not praise it. The DVD cover is cool, and that's when it ends. Just terrible.
