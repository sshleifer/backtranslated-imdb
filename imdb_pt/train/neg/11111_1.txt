Do not worry about wasting your money on this movie. Do not get in your car and think you might see this movie if someone else does not like you. If you need to watch a movie this weekend, go see Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with several weapons, a curious man who manages to find out all the clues that honest cops can not muster, and an innocent and overly curious but beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the public would love power call the girlfriend Mix up, add very poorly executed gore, and what the heck, let's put some freaks in there for a little "spin" for the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, and the characters unbelievable - Borat was more believable than that. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and can someone tell me how a butcher's vest can make a person's bullet rebound after being shot without making the person who was shot? I'm in the army. We need this kind of thing for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, and I would put in the rounded decimal places to give the lowest score possible.
