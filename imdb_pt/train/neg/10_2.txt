This movie was very promising, and the plot was relatively interesting, however, the actors, the director and the editors have seriously left the film. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wood, very few of the characters are believable. <br /> <br /> Whoever has edited this clearly, learned some new editing techniques and wanted to spread them throughout the film. There are many flashy and flashy editions in almost every scene, which are clearly symbolic, but end up being annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie and hope there was a decent resolution. for the collapse of balance, but unfortunately not, it made me feel like I wasted my time and the filmmakers wasted their money.
