This is very much a television version of the tale, the movie begins as an episode of 'Xena ...', with little meaningful dialogue or character description. It gets a bit more noun after a while, but all the characters are still caricatured. <br /> <br /> Salma is the exotic beauty. Richard Harris is an evil and sexually repressed Frollo, trying to finish off the sow in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo, are forgettable. It is also a kind of liberal version of history, Frollo is a suppressor of the ideals of the Enlightenment, like the abbot in 'Nome da Rosa', and Quasimodo is a defender of freedom. The dark side of the character Quas is ignored, although he spills liquid on people. He is really just an intruder in that he looks different and likes to play with the bells more than the average person. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film is intended for children, but I doubt it, considering that Frollo is a bloody frog to mend wanting to beat his monkey. Most uninteresting and forgettable, but not horrible, and sometimes fun, interpretation of the tale.
