This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half, it seems something close to 4. I have never seen a movie move so slowly and without purpose. This is also a "horror" movie that occurs most of the time during the day. My friend and I laughed an insane amount of times we should probably be afraid. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries. It can not be so loud on demand. <br /> <br /> Supermodel Nicole Petty must follow fashion because, although she is beautiful, she has lost her accent so many times in this movie, half the time she is British and half the time she is American.
