I can not remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as Justin Timberlake's in "Edison." I was so moved that I wanted to scream in anguish, to destroy the screen, to readily accept the desperate cries of nihilism. Timberlake is terribly miscast; In fact, climbing it is like climbing Andy Dick to play the lead role in "Patton," or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But this is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is simply a bad actor and would be equally terrible in any role. I used to have issues with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his metrosexual chirp (read litp), his boyish looks and emotional expressions that derive from something like "The 25 Cliches Expressions for Actors," he poisons the canvas he is ruthlessly inflicted on, and no matter how you do it, I do not and will not buy your role as an amateur journalist who has turned crusader-for-justice. It just will not fly. <br /> <br /> However, only Timberlake is not to blame for his failure. Director David J. Burke places him not only in the (primarily) primary role, but also puts him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was so good) LL Cool J I can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of these links interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> There is an advantage to this, of course: the moment any of these actors interact without Justin, it seems like a double relief. . A pleasure, if you want. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time together, but ten minutes are happy in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> But enough to beat Timberlake - words are not enough in this case to do the trick. "Edison" is a very, very common corruption story. His plot varies from clich√© to simply absurd. However, I admire the motivation behind doing it, which I interpret as a tribute to films like "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco," or maybe even "Chinatown." Do not get me wrong - "Edison" is not on the same level as these films, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its rationale, perhaps to justify my participation. <br /> <br /> The script, by itself, presents some surprisingly bad texts. Yes, there are some decent exchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (which is wasted here) and Timberlake seems to have been taken directly from an episode of Dawson's Creek. It's your typical dialogue that's very far from reality, let's impress the audience with how well we articulate (and fail). This dialogue, it is noted, is punctuated by good music at the wrong times - sometimes it seems that "Edison" wants to transform into a music video where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through poorly chosen music . and varying film speeds (read slow motion). <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. It is certain that hell has a cast to kill, but the performances are marked by Timberlake, which simply does not work. In movies, as in most arts, if one thing is wrong, the whole thing seems lost. Directors must make difficult choices. David J. Burke missed the mark here. Some of the scenes play well in themselves, but as a whole, they do not seem to fit together as pieces of puzzles of different puzzles forced into an incoherent image. And it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to start with.
