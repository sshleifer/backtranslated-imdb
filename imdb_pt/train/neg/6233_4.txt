Distraught karate / horror thriller, full of graphically bloody violence and gratuitous nudity, and a completely absurd and bizarre "plot". This is a low-level, low-level entertainment that will only attract viewers with weird tastes, but it's kinda cheery and I must admit I was not really bored while watching .... (* 1/2)
