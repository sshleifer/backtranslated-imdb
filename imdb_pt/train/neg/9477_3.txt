This must be one of the most terrible wrestlemanias of all time and is only saved by 2 matches. The hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley, also Vince Mcmahon vs. Shaun Michaels. The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete failure and to be honest I almost fell asleep, it was so action-free, the coffin game was not worthy of having the Undertaker and the game between Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke . If you really are a big fan of WWE and missed the early days of WWF and Wrestlemania 17 and 19, you'll probably love it. But I discovered that this Wrestlemania left a lot to be desired.
