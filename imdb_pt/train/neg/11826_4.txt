There is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different ... and end up being mediocre. I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball, but the same applies to Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This film is reasonably well represented and directed, but the script is a stinky one. Martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in "Roxanne," but this effort to bring a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene smacks of a wall of implausibility. If you want to see an old story updated with some style, better to rent "Great Expectations".
