Absolute garbage. The reason this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. The supposed star did nothing to solve the case - and no one really did - was just routine police work. Totally tedious. <br /> <br /> You sat all the way waiting for a turnaround - and you got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of potential in having a relative in apparent kidnapping. Could the lieutenant's personal involvement finally obscure his judgment? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were of a stranger doing this. But surely a genius like Lieutenant C, in constant conversation with her wronged husband, would gradually discover a diabolical plot involving a tape recorder playing in the bathroom while a masked bridegroom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues. It could have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
