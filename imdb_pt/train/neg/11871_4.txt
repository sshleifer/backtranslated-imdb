Gregory Peck's performance was excellent, as one would expect, and cinematography quite impressive, even when one touches directly on some melodramatic "momentum." But the rest of the film was overdone and difficult to watch, at least for me. I tried to like it, but I had to advance in the last 30 minutes. I feel like I missed some good hours. If it had not been for Gregory Peck, I would not have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10
