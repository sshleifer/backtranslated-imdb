What is most impressive about this semi-musical ensemble in 1920 is the wonderful cinematography and editing. It's top of the line from First National in these departments. The story is lightly engaging and resembling the entanglements of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY), where the hard-working girl is dated by a rich kid with family disapproval, complications, and ultimate achievement. All four musical numbers are grouped at the beginning of the movie and we go to a long stretch without any other musical dynamics. Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and repeats because of you. There is also not being blue and although you are not the first. <br /> <br /> Miller here is very engaging and delightful, quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in shape and delivery. Sad she does not dance like this is her forte. SALLY continues to be his best film, with the latter as the second and rather poor SUNNY a much lower runner-up. His life was tragically interrupted by sinusitis before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. It is worth visiting these films to see the star of Ziegfeld in the twenties.
