Sorry this movie did not scare me just bothered me. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential and that, all this, fell into oblivion. The children! The father! Premonition! Had so much potential and ziltch! zero, nothing! I've heard it all before. Spooky! Not! I can scared myself, here where I sit, than they could in the movie. Are men writing this figure that women should be so irritating? There is? This movie was quite atmospheric. Or at least it could have been if the director / writer had bothered to work. We could have had good music that would also increase the tension if someone made the effort. What I really want to know is why do they get the money? Just give it to me and save all the trouble. Abandoned? ... No, we where betrayed
