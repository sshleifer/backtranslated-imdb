I went to a pre-selection of this movie and was shocked at how tacky it was. It was a combination of every clich√© of horror / suspense, trying to comment on many things, including pedophilia, Satan worship, undercover cops, affairs, religion ... and it was a mess. the acting was beautiful to wash; the boy and Jesus' face were fine, but beyond them ... Anyway. I admire the effort (albeit a bit failed) in attempting to show the Christian people in a different way ... even though they have done so, the way he presented the gospel was a little stupid and kiddish. But again, it may have to be since he was talking to a child ... no. in fact, I have decided that everything is wrong. music ... oh my God ... awful ... toooo over-dramatic. OK. I felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premiere; It sounded like a poor student project. I'll stop complaining about it now and say the bottom line, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on the crap. here it is.
