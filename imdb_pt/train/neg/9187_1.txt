I watched some very poor movies in the past, but what the hell they were thinking when they made this movie. If the production team had turned into zombies when they had the idea to do it, because you certainly have to have a brain death to find some pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of most genres and I enjoy "shoot 'em' games, but mixing the silly scenes of the game just made it ridiculous and unwatchable. <br /> <br /> As most have said, there was virtually no script and the acting was weak. I will not waste my time describing this. <br /> <br /> Anyone who rates this movie above 4 has to be part of the producer or Sega, or else they have a distorted concept of entertainment. <Br/> <br /> I must say that I was more annoyed with the rental company, which gave a positive signal, which led me to rent it. Thank God I had a second movie to watch to restore some of my faith in the movies. <br /> <br /> The guy in the magazine would be right if he said "The worst movie ever"!
