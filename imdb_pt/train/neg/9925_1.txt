That was on Blazing Saddles' 30th anniversary DVD, himself brilliant, but not that. Nowhere have I seen the name of Mel Brook here and I can guess why, it makes a lot more sense not to be associated with this pilot. God, you'd think that was funny. Of course there may be a racial issue, but to me that was not funny, because it's not just funny. It's as if the writers did not even try to be funny, just to make money with Blazing Saddles. Did they expect this show to be for several seasons when they did this pilot? Flat out, they did not care. It was a quick cash cow that thankfully did not draw. I think it's useful only for historical purposes, or just to demonstrate just how stupid and unimaginative Hollywood writers can be.
