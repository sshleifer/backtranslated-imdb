The entrance of a Virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively, applying whatever meaning she wishes to her inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If this were an intentional feature of the film, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance - but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without getting too much into the plot summary, let's take a quick tour of the events. In an isolated hut, an orgy is underway which includes wrestling and topless diaper. A streak of stragglers joins the orgy in progress, but they were involuntarily followed by a monster I like to call "the muddy ninja." This monster precedes killing one by one the participants of the orgy, except the proverbial virgin (if you do not count the oral sex) that receives its seed and consequently becomes so enamored with the desire that it masturbates with the severed hand of somebody. <br /> <br /> Finally, she has her guts ripped out, and then there is a scene that seems to imply that she is pregnant with a muddy ninja baby. Has it all? If you are going to rent this movie, it is best that you do not speak Japanese and do not have subtitles. In a season full of Hollywood movies, putting that on your VCR may be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy. It will certainly be something different.
