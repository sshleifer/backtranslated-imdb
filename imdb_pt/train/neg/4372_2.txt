I love Don Knotts, let me tell you right away! He is a huge talent and the best at what he does, which portrays a nervous and lovingly confused loser, placed in a position of authority. He's fabulous in this role of reluctant astronaut Roy Fleming, but the film is really annoying, actually, although as a kid my brother and I loved watching it and his other films. Still worth watching, but in fact it is a movie that is most appreciated by children. I would rate this as 100% family friendly and something you could sit and watch with your kids on a family night out. <br /> <br /> Like all of Knotts' films, there is a great cast of beloved actor characters and you can not help but smile when Knotts gives one of his unsteady, gaping looks, no matter how old and tired you are. <br /> <br /> From an adult perspective, one thing I think is The movie is great about how NASA captures in the 1960s - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was amazed at how smooth and studious Leslie Neilsen was back then. The only complaint about the story is Roy's love interest, a rather shabby and despicable woman who can not give him the time of day until he becomes a big target - if you're like me, you'll be waiting for him give him the push in the end. Beware - you'll whistle the theme song for days after watching, it's captivating.
