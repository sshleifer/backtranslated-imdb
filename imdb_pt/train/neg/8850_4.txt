Now this movie will not scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two big reasons and a minor one - well, there are three reasons, is not it? <br /> <br /> The first reason for this is interesting is the special effects. I found them quite interesting and a bit spectacular. To see the growing hair on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was scary, especially when they were attending a menage a trois. Of interest is the fact that this Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown Sugar" of the Rolling Stones' music, and that she was in the infamous naked scene in the London cast of the musical Rock Hair. <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, there were two other points of note in this film. , and they were brought over and over during the final credits. I lost count, but I swear Sybil Danning showed these points to us in the final credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more. Theyu was the most striking feature of the film.
