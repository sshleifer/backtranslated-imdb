This is the only movie I've seen that is made by Uwe Boll, I knew he's probably the worst director ever, who always makes video-game movies too that "House of the Dead" is one of 100 Top Movies | I still wanted to watch it because I'm a big fan of the game and wanted to see what the movie does that makes it so bad. After watching I agree that sucks, the movie had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes, there was nothing but teenage girls without a brainless top running (for a moment was I wondering if the zombies are brain dead? Or are the girls?) So at night, the zombies came out of nowhere . And I started attacking people later, a woman started to shoot them, that is, it takes one place to another every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy? Or horror? or both? Before I knew it, I fell asleep in the second half and woke up during the final credits, so I could not watch all that, which is a good thing! The movie is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll please do not make more movies. Thank you!
