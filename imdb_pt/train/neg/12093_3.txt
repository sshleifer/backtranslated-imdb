Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actress. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this, giving the viewer a long image of Huppert's face, and it is a pleasure to see him. Huppert is not an animated actor - she records the excitement with the slightest raise of an eyebrow or with a smile. <br /> <br /> In addition to the pleasure of seeing an experienced actor stand out in his profession, there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend him. (Well, if you like self-mutilation, sadomasochism and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" might work for you. <br /> <br /> In addition to these attributes, I could not find any redeeming value in it.) <br /> <br /> Buried everywhere this strange material, there is a core of truth. People who compete at the highest level - musically, athletically, anything - begin as strangers, and are molded into strangers by the competitive environment. <br /> <br /> It's not worth a trip to a movie theater to reapply this life lesson. <br /> <br />
