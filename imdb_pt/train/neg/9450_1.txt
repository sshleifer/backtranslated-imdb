Spend your time in any other way, even housework is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny, the fun rhymes that are Dr. His are not there. A very bad way to waste a night. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at first the younger ones got tired and stopped playing Barbies and the older ones went out to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I ended up alone. It was the worst "kids" movie I ever saw. If you want to watch a fun children's movie watch Shrek 2, this movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS MOVIE. It's not funny, it's not cute, the cat's makeup is the only good thing in it and you can see it on the disc label.
