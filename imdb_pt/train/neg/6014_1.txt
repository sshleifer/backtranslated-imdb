Left Behind is an incredible waste of over $ 17 million. The acting is weak and uninspired, the story even weaker. The public is asked to believe in the plot totally implausible and often laughable and give nothing in return for their good faith. Not only is the film misrepresented and scripted, but it is also seriously deficient in all technical areas of cinema. The production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action. The effects are totally non-original and flat. Enlightenment and general continuity are indescribably terrible; even compared to movies with one-tenth of the budget. However, none of this will matter in millions of families, no doubt embracing the film for its integrity and religious tendencies; And who can blame them. However, it is unfortunate that they are forced to accept third-rate amateur cinema.
