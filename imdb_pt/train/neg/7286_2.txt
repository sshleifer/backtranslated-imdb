Back in the youth, the old man wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbade him. Many decades later, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother # 1, and jumps on the bed of brother # 2. <br /> <br /> One might think that the three brothers are trapped somewhere on a remote island. But no - they are upper-class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see a flirtatious moment between any unrelated woman and the two siblings. We never see any moment of flirtation between any unrelated man and the only sister. All flirting moments are shared only between brothers and sister. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of the GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young Emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of half-blooded girls all over the world, but no - did he just want his sister? If incest in the movies is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you without end.
