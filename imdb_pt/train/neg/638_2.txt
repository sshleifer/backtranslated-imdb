The Good Earth is perhaps the most annoying movie I have ever seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting is bordering comedic. Although I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I saw a movie that does not do its true justice. The only saving grace I found in this movie is the value of production. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. In addition, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps are easily sold and revolutionary at the time. In addition to the production value, I can say little more that is good or interesting about this movie.
