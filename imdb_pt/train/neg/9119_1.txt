I actually saw this movie in the movies at its original release. It was painful to see Peter Sellers embarrass himself so much. The story was incredibly stupid and hard to follow, and the ending was ridiculous. It was sad to see how powerful had fallen. I'm not going to say that I'm a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I really enjoyed the Pink Panther series and felt that he did a great performance in Being There. But this movie should never have been made. From what I read, he sought to produce this film against the advice of the people around him. Okay, but that still does not excuse the studio actually releasing the movie.
