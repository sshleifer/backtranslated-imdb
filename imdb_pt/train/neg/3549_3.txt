Do you like to stand? So stay away from it ... During the early rounds, there are indeed good comics, but unless they have some cute qualities, they have a chance at snowballs. Any controversial material and you're out! ... and I think I hurt myself as much as the discarded comedians, when I see who the dishonest judges are letting in. <br /> <br /> 1 of my top 4 went further than the preliminaries. Half the finalists gave me the laughs. Several of them have picked up their material elsewhere, something the judges do not seem to have problems with. <br /> <br /> It's more fun than much of what else is on TV, but incredibly difficult to watch without contemplating. what could have been. <br /> <br /> If the producers changed the name of the contest to "Last Clown Standing", all my critics would lose validity. Maybe an idea?
