Incredibly clumsy, off-putting and finally ridiculous ("the horses, oh my God, the horses!") Thriller. It's scary at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. See how in the final 10 minutes everyone "magically" does exactly what the storyline needs for "resolution" to take place. Performances pleasing to the protagonists, one typically eccentric by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real work of hacking, cutting scenes in half and making the film even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 5 stars.
