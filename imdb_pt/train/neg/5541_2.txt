Since the movie-loving universe has befriended a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically associated with blood-soaked terror images and non-stop action sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" formed the zombie movie as we know it now. However, in the early years of cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses was used only in slow, almost non-actionable psychological films. "I walked with a zombie" by Jacques Tourneur is a perfect example and "White Zombie" starring Bela Lugosi. This "Zombie Revolt" could have been another example, but unfortunately it's a flaw all along the line and easily one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, a very poorly written script and a complete lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts only 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is totally wasted on stupid intrigues of love stories and uninteresting monologues. The setting in the legendary Cambodian town of Angkor certainly could have resulted in a more convincing story, but all we see are interior photos. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, curly-haired blonde and ugly nose) irritated me greatly and I kept waiting for a voracious undead to suddenly appear to devour her. Fucking again ?? If you manage to struggle for 60 minutes of drowsiness, you will be rewarded with a pretty decent end. Still, that's too little to give this movie a positive rating, much less a recommendation. Avoid! This is the kind of movie you should see only if you've already seen all the rest.
