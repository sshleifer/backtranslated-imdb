Dear Richard, I know we all love you in Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, you have nothing more to do but the sequels of Air Bud? I would have thought that Tim could have given him a small role now or even become his personal assistant. I know this sounds ironic, but the payout benefits are far more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you for Tim and instantly think of "Tool Time". You could even get roles with Bob Vila more often. Instead, you show up for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smiling. I know there was not much script, but you could have added it to it. I mean, come on. Tim owes one to you. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does nothing for the Air Bud line. Quite the contrary, fake puppies speak louder than dogs actually do sports. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, know this more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is an "F" movie.
