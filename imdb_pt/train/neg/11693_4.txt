A fun concept, but poorly executed. Except for the good effects of makeup, there is not much to do. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what appears to be weeks and weeks to go from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to thinness in days ... and since he is deadly skinny he gets pretty much equally deadly thin what seems like a long time. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film has much worse problems than that - cinematography is decidedly low budget - TV show quality and above all the acting is pretty awful around. Robert Burke seems to be always trying some kind of weird imitation of Charlton Heston and it's literally painful to watch ... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm giving this movie as loud as I is is that once the movie goes into its final 1/3 or more and Joe Mantegna's character takes over, the movie develops a fun and extravagant feel of cheese slaughter. The gangsters' wacky schemes to plague the totally obnoxious gypsies are kind of fun to watch. The ending, if predictable, is also very good. Avoid unless you're a King-o-Phile or really excited about the idea of ​​Tony Fatty's voice of the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp.
