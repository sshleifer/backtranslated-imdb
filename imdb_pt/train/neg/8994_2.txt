This movie is a great example of wasting great features on a movie. You've got future stars from SNL and SCTV in their early days, like John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, essentially making 70 minutes of crude, uninspired jokes. The concept of a network of future subversive society might have been brought to some interesting extremes, but instead plays a joke of juvenile and proctology and remains in this vein of humor throughout the course. Look for the sooner and more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the latest and most hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule from the 1970s bad comedy movies.
