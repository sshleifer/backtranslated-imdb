I was enjoying this movie most of the time, but I always had the feeling of watching a children's movie. I honestly think someone wrote a pg script and then, during filming, decided to add some blood, nudity and language. was a big disappointment. One must believe that the magic of children exists in such films as "babe" (the pig) or "angels in the outfield" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. parents end up believing their daughter about their ability to see the ghost and use this ability to supernaturally defeat the fairy tooth. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a b-movie response to the terrible darkness falls; they somehow manage to make a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but they do not. they have made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost in the dark.
