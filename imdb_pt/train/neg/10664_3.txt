A very tired Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employees for some apparatus these non-heroes plan to sell to "the Iranians." The absurdity of "Silk Stalkings" producers' low-rent video offers decent action scenes and many ineptly played "dramas" ... lack of logic and truly terrible dialogue are the defining aspects, although the final twists and turns change It could have been a cool ending to a better movie. Burt still has presence, although that also means you notice more when he says "one-liners" insultingly half-cooked.
