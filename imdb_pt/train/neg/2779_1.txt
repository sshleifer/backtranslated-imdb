Of course, when you offer an actor enough money, they will do anything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects of the B movies of the 1950s and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse. As for how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion. English was terribly accentuated and I do not think anyone could speak English, they just memorized how words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character "realistic" and real.
