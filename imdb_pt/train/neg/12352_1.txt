<br /> <br /> As this movie has already averaged 6 stars is beyond me. The script is so banal and, frankly, an insult to whom life is based. Cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, does not show any surprise by participating in this film if we look at her tracklist. All in all, a "high concept" movie that Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
