I must say that I am quite disappointed with this "horror" movie. I was not scared even once while watching. Also not a lot of suspense .... I was able to guess the ending in the middle of the movie ... So ... what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a frighteningly scary movie. I would like other movies to stop copying from him (for example, the brand: long hair). Please give me some originality. <br /> <br /> Will not recommend this movie.
