Scotty (Grant Cramer, who was to star in the big B movie "Killer Klowns from Outer Space") agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn to "talk" with the girls in this bad comedy of the '80s. Not bad as in language of the 80's, which meant good. Bad as bad. No friendly characters, including, but not limited to, a boy who's the weirdest guy since "Friday the 13th part 2," a girl who leads men and then goes into hissy when he wants to touch her, and the symbol fat slob, why anyway what would a 80's sex comedy without a fat slob ?? Well, this one has two. This movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of sex comedies of the 80's. And then came the sequel, thus deepening the proverbial barrel. <br /> <br /> My notes: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: too numerous to tell, you even see the weird kid who imagined breasts on the spot, I think "Bachlor Party" but not so funny, and very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Where I Saw: Comcast Moviepass
