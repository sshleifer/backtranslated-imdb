Now I've never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what about the songs in the movie that physiological meaning has. WOW some demented Pokémon appear and they multiply I can have a seizure with that. Animie is useless the creators of it are useless is a great marketing scheme look only cut songs and they will get a good rating I think this movie would have been nice if they put a message that you should see all Pokémon episodes to understand what is happening and it is not a movie. It's just an animation that should be on video. <br /> <br /> Ps: I'm going to give a 1 because I only have 5 dollars I could not give half because there are no halves.
