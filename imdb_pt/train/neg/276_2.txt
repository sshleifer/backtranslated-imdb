The characters are clich√©s and predictable, with all or snow white, pure or completely evil. The acting is too complicated to be bad in a fun and exaggerated way. It's doubly disappointing if you're a Bette Davis fan because your character is not typically a Bette-Davis type character; she can only frown thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> In general, neither my wife nor I find the film interesting, exciting or entertaining.
