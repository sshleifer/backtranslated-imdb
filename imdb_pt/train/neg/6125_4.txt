This is the best film the couple Derek ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you have not seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: it's just as bad as their other efforts, we can watch Bo undress or test for wet T-shirt contests quite often, the story is ridiculously dumb, and the film takes itself too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa? <br /> <br /> But there are some things for that. Bo looks great, the production values ​​(sets, costumes, etc.) are very good, and this greatly increases the value of the camp. In a strange way, it's really funny simply because he tries to be serious and fails so much.
