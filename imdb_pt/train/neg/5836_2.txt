From the pen of Richard Condon (The Manchuria Candidate of 1962), comes this confused tale of political intrigue and murder. The story, told in almost comics, is difficult to swallow. Considered the cast of all stars, this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew: the novel was fraught with the same shortcomings. It seems that sometimes the story is mocking the most sincere effort placed in the "Manchu Candidate". A disappointment in every respect.
