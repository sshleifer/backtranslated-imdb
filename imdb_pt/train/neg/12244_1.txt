This movie is horrible. CGI is the CGI of very cheap ash. The crocodile looks like a big gray spot. The worst is that no effort is made to make him walk or look like he is alive. It's mostly a CGI with photo-shop that's put in scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that's moving the CGI spot across the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of very bad movies on the Sci-Fi Channel. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is comprised of typical low-cost actors who probably work as waiters at local snack bars while waiting for their large breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is trying to assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps from the water to the second floor of the Villains' headquarters and across the porch and takes the villain out of Kate and instead of falling straight into the building (and crush Kate), the Croc simply flies back at the same angle in the water. No law of physics can be applied to this film or special effects. At least there is honor among the crocodiles.
