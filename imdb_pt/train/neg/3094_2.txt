**** SMALL SPOILERS *** As a connoisseur of bad movies, I must have seen hundreds of bad movies and yet, "Hobgoblins" stands out from all others in its own unique way. Classical baddies like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Hands" are uniformly bad from start to finish. "Hobgoblins", on the other hand, begins badly and becomes progressively worse. During my first performance of the infamous rake fight scene, I thought to myself that this was a really bad movie. I was happy to know that I had just seen the best this movie had to offer. The film takes its most massive fall into celluloid hell during the painful and inept "Club Scum" sequence, which is a continuous sequence of one bland joke after another. With only this film, director Rick Sloane proves he deserves mention alongside names like Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Watch "Hobgoblins" and no longer be surprised.
