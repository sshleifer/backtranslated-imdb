Also known in a different way as "House of Exorcism," this confusing little movie takes itself so seriously that it kills any entertainment value. <br /> <The replay scenario involves the European tourist Elke Sommer, who has a chance to run with Telly Savalas, who looks like the devil she saw in a fresco in the square. Sommer is given a ride to a mysterious house in the country, where Savalas happens to be the butler. There she is mistaken for a long-dead woman, and the true theatricality of the novel begins. The husband of the blind matriarch of the house had an affair with the dead woman, who was the bride of the matriarch's son. The couple who took the ride to Sommer? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman is giving the driver, "driving lessons in the back seat," and the husband knows and does not care. Eventually, most of the cast is dead, Sommer is drugged and raped, escapes, and the spectator is brought to a climax on board a void. <br /> </ p> <br /> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> < , has scenes, which involves a priest, the Elite Entertainment's VHS copy, is clear and letterboxed, there are "extras" after the final credits, sex excluded, and bloody scenes. Mario Bava's direction is fast and furious, but his script is horrible.There are half-baked ideas, abandoned plots and stunning conveniences that do nothing more than push this thing in some kind of forward direction. has life as mannequins for practice funerals, the blind matriarch does not act so blindly, and Savalas recites be the same lollipops he had in "Kojak" (who <br /> <br /> haunts ya, baby?). <br /> <br /> The project looks like they had two star names, so he wrote the script quickly, something that happens in Hollywood in a daily occurrence <br /> <br /> now. Savalas seems completely lost, delivering his lines tentatively, and wishing that his character had not died in "The Dirty Dozen." Sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot, but his character is a blank, I use the term "character" loosely. The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really weird movie, and your reaction to it may depend on <br /> <br /> How heavily you are in Eurohorror and Kojak. I, at least, can not reward "Lisa and the Devil." <br /> <br /> This is not rated, and includes all the extras at the end of VHS <br /> <br /> copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong gore, strong female nudity, male nudity , sexual and adult content <br /> <br /> situations
