I could not wait to put this movie on my DVD player when I rented it. So after I started, I could not wait to get it off my DVD player. Actually I watched the whole movie. My wife and I kept waiting and hoping something funny to happen, but nothing funny does. The box said it would be very funny. The premise of the movie looks good. Ben Stiller is funny. Jack Black is funny. How could this movie lose? Well ... miss you! This is the most unusual "comedy" I have ever seen. No one I talked to thought it was even funny. It's just a really bad movie. Trust me. Avoide it .... AVOID IT !!
