Eita, only in the 70's ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this peculiar hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu movie evolving around a treasure hunt. The spices of this useless co-production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian company include funny stories, off-wall events and some very tame T & A. Extravagant moments are being served by the detestable wig of Lee Van Cleef, the psychopath Yancey Hobbitt (incredibly battered by Julian Ugarte, the man who should have made genre productions darker than he), either - witty dialogues, hilarious background music, and completely laughable sound effects that accompany several small events (especially all the jumps made by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> As this little piece of action falls, it falls into the turkey territory. , it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can not deny the charisma of this duo. Do not expect too much, and you will get plenty of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What is yours?
