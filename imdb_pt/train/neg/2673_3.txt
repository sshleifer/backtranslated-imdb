It's not long enough to be long and not abrupt enough for a short, this thing exists for a reason, having a three-way lesbian. There are worse reasons to exist. One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature film. Misty fits comfortably into her outfit and is a very arrogant girl and when people are so in love with a game character like Lara Croft who make nude calendars of her, you know that a soft-core movie is ready to explode. Unfortunately, this is pretty pathetic. Especially the scene of painfully false sex between Darian and Misty, where you can see her hand is touching the air. Watch this if you can not get enough of Misty or Ruby, which makes a beautiful blonde and has a zerst of always.
