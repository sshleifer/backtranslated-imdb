Elephants Dream should be the main project of the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in concept, it actually failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully reproduced, which is probably the only redeeming factor. One huge problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of light blooming. It's awful though I think it helps give the movie a dream quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is the terrible dubbing. While Proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent, Emo's voice actor is HORRIBLE. I think when you have a budget that basically equals zero, you can not hire real speakers. To me, it looks like they hired one of the animators to make his voice. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the movie is not going anywhere. To me, it looks more like a "look what we can do" movie than a real movie. The plot does not get anywhere and fails to really show any interesting point. The whole movie looks like it was made as an excuse to create interesting areas. <br /> <br /> Overall, it may be worth a quick download from the official website, but expect nothing but beautiful graphics.
