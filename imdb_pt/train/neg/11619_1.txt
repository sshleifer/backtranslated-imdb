I watched the entire movie, waiting and waiting for something to happen. Maybe it's my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology? It is a strange recount of the Oedipus myth: I want to kill my father and my mother and marry my uncle and compose a musical theater with him? I did not understand why certain elements of the plot were present: why the building was up there, why there was that great staircase with a perfect place for someone to fall into their fate if no one really did, why the scenes at all the father at work, why have a kitchen so good if you're only going to eat food, why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents would be the only ones to resist, and not the other way around? I see many good reviews for this movie ... has my taste been corrupted when uploading with b-70s and science fiction films?
