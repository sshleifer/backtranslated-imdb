Oh, man. If you want to give your inner Crow T. Robot a real exercise, this is the movie that appears on the old VCR. The potential for cut lines in this film is simply infinite. <br /> <br /> Hey, do you really care if a movie of this quality is "spoiled?") Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual passion for the father of the opposite sex. But this girl seems to have one for her sex, and I do not think there's a term for it. It may be because her mother, Dana, is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose beautiful sexuality, nudity and neonate sexuality makes me forgive any number of bad movies or unfriendly characters. Here, Dana is not only ignorant of her daughter's conduct; she appears to be competing for the gold medal in the Indulgent Mother's Contest. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Dana loses Traci's murderous betrayal because, truth be told, Traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster. It's just because the script dictates that it can pull off any kind of body count. <br /> <br /> A particularly hilarious note in this film is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid who is described by Dana as "For so long she is like one of the families, though she dresses herself with what the director thought she would say : "I just fell off the Guadalajara tomato truck." Carmen is so wise with Traci's plans that she can also use a sign saying "Hey, I'm the next victim!" Sure enough, Traci confronts Carmen while Carmen is coming back from Mass, and jumps off with one of those slightly angled wheel wrenches that car makers put next to their leftovers as a bad joke. I suspect that in real life these things are as useless as a crime weapon as they are to change a tire. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, Arquette wears a fragile dress in a vineyard, under a cloudy sky, talking to the owner. Cut her into another frail dress under the sunny sky, talking to the owner's brother. Then she cut to her wearing the first dress, in the first place, under a cloudy sky - but it's to be later. You get the picture. We're talking about a very bad direction. <br /> <br /> As for the skin, do not expect too much, although Traci has a good pair of bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those looking for boring junk, 8. For anyone else, 1/2.
