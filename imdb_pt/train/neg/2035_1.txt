I have been learning about the zodiac for four years now. And I'm not saying that I know much more than anyone ... in fact, most people who know and read and learn about Z, I'm the only one with less knowledge ... But I know or at least I think I know that most things in this would not happen ... From how he signed his name ... how he killed people ... I thought the godfather was the worst movie of all time ... Cinematography was five years old ... not saying that my films are better, but I'm not someone who is making movies for the mass population ... <br /> <br /> The acting that I thought of most of it was very good, in fact I did ... the leadership did not say so much on the camera or everything I forgot and I do not know why I stopped watching ... ... <br /> But really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else ... like a big pizza or something ... <br /> <br /> Until I learn to write a review, Psycho Phil
