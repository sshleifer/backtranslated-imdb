This movie has all the marks of many cooks spoiling the stew. Based on the autobiography of Shielah Graham, it seems that the powers could not leave well enough alone. They could not decide whether this was Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and how much they should smooth the story of whoever it was. So a film that could have been a story about two fascinating personalities (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Ms. Graham) becomes a sad disconnected novel about this that tells us little about any of them. In addition, there is absolutely no sensation of period beyond 1959. The clumsy scene follows a clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in history or how much time is passing. However - and that saved the movie for me - Kerr never looked more handsome, and Peck is as always a very handsome man. They really make a beautiful, mature couple, and I just wanted them to have better material to work with. There is a scene that works - Scott goes after Shielah while he is drunk, and seeing these two normally refined stars beating is very disturbing and gives a fleeting idea of ​​what happens in a relationship like theirs. Other than that, the film is a wasted opportunity and does not even come close to the classic stature of other soaps produced in Wald in the year 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF ALL).
