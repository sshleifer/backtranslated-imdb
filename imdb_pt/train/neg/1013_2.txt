If you watched this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe!!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I can not believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J picked up the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I'm not much fun of him ... but I really prefer an actor, not this android named Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, empty and annoying as hell. I was happy when the two were thrown into the street. <br /> <br /> The story was good and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his role well as a villain. The movie was fun, but I think Timberlake ruined everything. It would have been very nice without him. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was good, but suddenly every time the song appeared the movie turned into an MTV music video with flashes, low motion and stuff like that. . Something lost for this cop movie, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake.
