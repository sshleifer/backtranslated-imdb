The film is basically the story of the return of a Russian prostitute to her home village for the funeral of a sister / friend. There are some other smaller lines that may be more interesting than the one that was taken, but are not fully exploited. The core of the movie is the funeral, wake up and later controversy over the future of a community of witches who make dolls and sell them to buy vodka, but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently, the movie is not edited. The journey from the prostitute of the city to the village is a terribly endless train journey and wander the mud. Perhaps this should impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and a male, the consort of the dead girl. Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most of the film is filmed with a handheld camera that can induce nausea. Another problem for western viewers is that the captions do not include the songs and the wailing of the witches. Do not go to this movie unless you are fluent in Russian.
