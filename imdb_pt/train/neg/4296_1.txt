I was going to say that this was the worst gay movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say that this is the worst movie of all genres I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You Know You You are in trouble when a film begins with a "personal note" from the director asking for "understanding" of the audience for the "many challenges" faced by a director for the first time. The audio track is so bad in many scenes that it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this from a DVD version. Bad lighting, bad scenery, bad pictures, bad script, generally poor performance, all make this "movie" unacceptable. I managed to get to the bad end after several attempts, and immediately delivered the DVD that I got foolishly. I'm sure there are many challenges for a beginning director. But, do not try to ward off this stupid attempt as a finished product. I see from IMDb details that this was not only Richard Natale's first attempt at directing, but also the only one. That's the only positive thing I can say about this so-called "movie."
