I saw this DVD at my friends house and thought this was a Turkish action movie with some not-too-big Hollywood names in it. Interested enough I decide to give it a shot later .. It was a difficult experience to bear, believe me. So, after finally seeing the credits, I thought, "We Turks really suck at Hollywood-style movies. That's an insult to the assault on the hostage film genre," but wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary, it was literally filmed in the United States with an American director and crew! That made me think again! - How can you convince names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? with money probably .. It made me think further .. How can you raise such an amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? So all of my meditation was worth it and I came to find the answer. By hiring the cheapest equipment and the staff you can find. And if you still have difficulty adjusting your budget, then: writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce, or vice versa, I have no information on that. So this is not a bad movie because everyone is so eager to introduce themselves as ... It makes you think - in my case, even meditate - and there are many movies that do not even give that effect. at least it makes you think; It makes you wonder .. It leaves you in disbelief .. and then it makes you wonder again ..
