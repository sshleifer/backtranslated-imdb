I have it as a turkey movie and I was not disappointed. Acting - In general, although many have taken part in other films, of course they have had to work hard to act so badly constantly throughout this time. film without accidentally letting some degree of acting out. <br /> <br /> Lot - being generous, I could tell that the screenwriter originally started with a plot, but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke faster than a Chinese knocked over the computer <br /> <br /> Scrip - now that was an abomination of nature. it did not flow with any rhyme or reason. most of the lines by the characters were, at best, pathetic to imbecilics. the script worked hard to ensure that no character was considered memorable. I watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - ROTFLMAO !!!!! They were short bus specials. Direction - Until you can create your own driving ability, copy the style of your favorite direction, otherwise you will only make flaws like that. <br /> <br /> It's good to know that your friends / family gave you 10 stars for this movie
