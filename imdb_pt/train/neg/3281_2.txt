I suspected the movie would be bad. I'm a fan of a duke from a long time ago. Has three years of TV series on DVD. Well, I was right. It took the family to see this. I really wanted to see General jump again and some scenes of pursuit jumps were good. But to summarize, the movie was a crooked version of the TV show. <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. Although I can honestly say that Daisy's original clothes were so revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply awful. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle must be rolling in their graves as well. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you are an old Dukes fan tried and true like me and my three children you will be very disappointed.
