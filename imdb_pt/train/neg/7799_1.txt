What in the name of God happened here? How do you create what is practically a cheap imitation of Redneck Zombies? The Zombie '90 supposedly entertained someone ... someone, or even made money? But mostly, what happened here? <br /> <br /> The Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic named Andreas Schnaas, specializing in bloody films such as the Gore Chalice and Anthropophagus 2000, some of which contain profanity. in titles. In the gore department, this is not much different from the rest. Although, the level of ineptitude ... well, earthquake. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive is bloody, think about it. <br /> <br /> Getting too specific with history would be a waste of time. An accident, involving chemicals, causes the dead to return and eat the living. Never has the concept been treated that way. The bloody effects are a whole new. Just a Z-grade nightmare. I can not say whether or not this was originally meant to be funny, somehow, I doubt that English dubbing was being very faithful to the original script, but strange things happened. The whole thing reminds me of an introduction to a Troma movie except that it lasts much longer. <br /> <br /> I saw only one movie that was worse than that, To prove that Andreas Schnaas is a real director, I highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standard on what you are looking for in a movie Bad, try Extreme Pestilence, but you've been warned. It takes nerves of steel to get to the end. But if blood is all that you are here, then you can handle this one. Also, no atmosphere, no, and I mean no budget, no entertainment value, but mostly, no pride. Show some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated 7/7/09: After a few more shows of Zombie '90, I had a change of heart, or I think I just understood now. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so leave the harsh words out there, although Extreme Pestilence still deserves only one star.
