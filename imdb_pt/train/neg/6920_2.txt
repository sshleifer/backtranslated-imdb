Body Slam (1987) is a terrible movie. The low budget smells, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and acting are thighs. But if you enjoy old-school wrestling (circa 1970 until the mid-80's) then you'll be more entertained than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie stinks on the ice. I gave it two because I felt like being generous. This turkey was "directed" by stuntman Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a bunch of fighters and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> The synopsis of this "movie" is about a promoter who wants to combine "hair". but I do not want SPOIL for you.If you can handle the bad acting and futile plot, there are a few surprises near the end for fans of wrestling. stubborn. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this to my worst enemy (and I mean it).
