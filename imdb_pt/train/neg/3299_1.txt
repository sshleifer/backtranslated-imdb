This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was really expecting a bad movie, but I was taken by surprise, believe it or not. The plot is the traditional, all cliches are included. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so poorly written that you really laugh when the actors in the other half of the descent are trying to make it look real. The picture is not very good, the music is so malplaca that makes me angry, the actors are not even trying, although the script makes it almost impossible for you to wait more than people who have been acting for 30 years and the so-called Scenes action really manage to lose the "action" itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why these kinds of bad movies keep coming, who's financing that shit? Where's the sorting? And why do the actors take on this impossible script of mission? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movies in this genre, not even aspiring to hit theaters, but even they, straight to the video, really can look professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive about this, except the title that explains it all, I feel stolen from 2 hours of my life.
