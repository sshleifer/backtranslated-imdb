"Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and dumbest movie I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's vacation videos are more fascinating. <br /> <br /> The actors seem to be recruited on uglypeople.com. They have no talent for acting convincingly. <br /> <br /> They walk and walk and walk through the forest. There is more walking around than in the three parts of "The Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I started reading a Porsche brochure while watching "Trigger Man" along the way. Terrible. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time and money. I would give the movie 0 stars out of 10, since that is not possible, I have to give 1 star.
