I read reviews about this movie and decided to give it a shot. I am an open-minded guy after all and I gave good reviews for some really bad movies. As the final credits rolled in this I searched for meaning and something nice to say. Here goes: "This movie was mercifully short." That's all I have. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay. Scenarios and visuals were well done and the music helped lend the asylum living climate, but the film was painful to watch and the interminable dialogue took away the good bits. I found myself laughing at this movie, but the way you laugh at your best friend who was just ashamed in front of a large crowd. <br /> <br /> At the time of the "chicken dance" in the end I had just decided to fold and roll with the movie and let the bodies fall where they fall. I do not know what could have saved this movie. The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget, but there was simply no way to watch it; not even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. Maybe I should have lit a doobie or drunk a lot of beer to get the full experience of the movie. Anyway, I'm not going to watch that movie again unless you're really depressed. So I can tell myself "At least I was not in 'Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon.' I'm better than these guys."
