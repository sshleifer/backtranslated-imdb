As I said, the book was very good and this could have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert had not been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead role. What kind of accent was he supposed to be anyway? It looked the same as her horrible Russian accent in another movie I saw her in. Every time she opened her mouth I cringed. It took 3 tries before I could watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was good as the other leader. <br /> <br /> I really liked the beach scenes. They added a much needed glow to take your mind off Melissa Gilberts' depressing photo. I think they could have used views of San Francisco more to their advantage. It seemed like the night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I do not remember the character in the book being so depressing. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert out of any future film that requires an accent!
