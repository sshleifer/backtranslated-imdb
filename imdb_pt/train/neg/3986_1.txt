When I refer to Malice as a film noir, I do not compare it to masterpieces like Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor do I compare director Becker to Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I am just registering a protest against the darkness that permeates this film from beginning to end, in that most of the time you simply can not understand what is happening. I can understand the darkness in night scenes, but this movie was dark even in broad daylight, why I'm at a loss to understand. However, it would not have made much difference if director Becker had filmed it in total darkness.
