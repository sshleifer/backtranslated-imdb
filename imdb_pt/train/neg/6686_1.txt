There is not a particle of entertainment throughout this movie. There is not a scary, funny or even interesting scene in this movie. It announces itself as a horror and is called comedy. He does not even try humor. Nor does it try to be scary. Not to be bored with this movie, you would have to be one of the funniest people in the world. If you like this movie, even a little more than you have no standard for what you watch at all. I'm having a hard time understanding what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with that. It's not funny, scary, shocking or intriguing. So, should it be a drama? Because it really was not dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Life is too precious to waste 90 minutes watching it.
