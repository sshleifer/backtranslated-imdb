A big disappointment. This was one of the best drama / detective shows in the UK in the 1990s, which developed the intriguing title character played by Scotsman Robbie Coltrane. However, this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable disappointment due to high expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus. Coltrane does not have much to do, much more attention is given to the unattractive killer, and in what he has to act, he seems not to be involved, almost bored. The ex-soldier's story is written by the books and the attempt to update us about Coltrane's family life seems slight. Maybe if the writers had a whole series in front of them, instead of just a two-hour show, they would have written it in much more depth. As it is, skip this one and watch the old Cracker of the 90s, which is far superior.
