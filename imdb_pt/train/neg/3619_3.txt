Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks he has a zombie in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and all of a sudden, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all, when you're going to make a movie, you must decide whether it's a thriller or a drama! As a drama, the film is watchable. Parents are getting divorced and arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet that totally spoils the whole movie! I was hoping to see a BOOGEYMAN-like movie, and instead I watched a drama with some nonsense thriller. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 just for parents playing well and dialogues of offspring. As for the shots with Jake: ignore them.
