I entered the theater for Captain Sky in 2004, expecting a good movie. Almost all of the reviews in this film were positive, the effects looked attractive, the previews were compelling. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, in fact, disappointment does not describe the feeling I had with this movie. It was anger. <br /> <br /> Besides being annoying and poorly written, the reason this movie gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the movie was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between a tribute and stealing: this was stealing. More importantly, it seems the filmmakers did not steal to advance a point or move the plot together. They stole just to show they could. There is literally no point in showing a clip of The Wizard of Oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie, except to create another scene (which I will not elaborate on) that steals from the same movie. Needless to say, every concept in the film was neither original nor even a version of an old concept: it was literally just a repetition of something I had seen, from folder-era robots reminiscent of old Superman cartoons and "The Iron Giant" for the silent villainous martial artist who has been used in countless films, most recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul in "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace." <br /> <br /> Real movie subject, most of the performances were completely wood. Maybe it's because the whole movie was done on a blue screen, with computer images filling everything except the actors. Frankly, that's no excuse for bad acting. If a person has ever been a child, they understand that lack of visual reference is no excuse not to try. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in this movie. The protagonists are the only real humans here. Almost all antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters shown during the movie can be counted in one hand. If robots are attacking the entire planet, should not we expect to see masses of humanity fleeing them? The unsatisfactory performance of the main characters prevents us from actually connecting with anything here. <br /> <br /> The film was not the worst movie of all time, and that's why I did not give it 1 The film was instead an example of all that is wrong in movies modern action: the filmmakers tried to justify the film with special effects, but without artistic vision or originality of any kind, it falls flat.
