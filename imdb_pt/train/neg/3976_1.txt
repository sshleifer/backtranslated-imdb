The plot was monotonous, the girls were upset and the supposed Italian leader had never heard an Italian accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this movie, but it seemed to be full of mediocre people. There was literally no redeeming feature about this movie. <br /> <br /> I think this is a graveyard for actors who will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason. <br /> <br /> I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.
