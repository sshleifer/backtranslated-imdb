First, I'd like to excuse my lousy English. <br /> <br /> I'm not an unconditional fan of HOSTEL, but I enjoyed this movie anyway. Live Feed, however, gave a lot of time! I've never seen a gore movie with superb acting, but hey, who's surprised? The Live Feed performance was ... well, it's not there! I've seen some comment on this as it must have been a school project or something. Okay, but not by students in the media or acting school. This was no class at all! And the story? A very sad rip-off at the Hostel. What about gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that are supposed to make your gut squirm and leave you in cold sweat? That was the most disappointing thing about the movie from the hole! Short, fast and borderless. More like an execution instead of torture. Okey, where there were buckets of blood, but it did not even look real. The massacre and violence reminded Braindead more than Hostel or any of Saw's films. And Braindead was fun! Okay, I laughed at the Live Feed a couple of times, but this was more out of disappointment than out of sheer fun! <br /> <br /> So instead of wasting 80 minutes watching Live Feed, watch ANYONE else!
