It's hard to imagine that anyone would find this short if they saw most of their shorts, but I know the mood is VERY subjective. I saw all his sound shorts (by far the best of his IMO stuff) and I found this one of his weaker efforts. <br /> <br /> In the year it was done (1930) Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one feature. They were extremely popular and their boss, Hal Roach, made the most of them, keeping them constantly working. Also, this was a time of experimentation for writers and Stan. I would say this was an experience that did not really work. As someone said, this does not affect your strengths. Plenty of dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The best part of that for me is the largely improvised sequel to Stan as Agnes, the maid, and the great Thelma Todd talking about "girls" stuff. <br /> <If you really want to see the most creative and funny kids, check out Blotto, or Brats From the same year. <br /> <br /> They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for dumping some less than shorts. They did something like 108 movies together. Very few (except those made on FOX) were absolute failures, but there are a few. County Hospital, me and my friend, The Live Ghost, The Fixer Uppers come to mind as essentially weak. But others then I find something wonderful in almost all of their shorts. Quite a record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed all your other short ones, then please check this one out, but I'd be willing to bet that this was less than memorable for Stan. and Babe.
