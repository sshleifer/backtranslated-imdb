Where was his critique of democratic and republican administrations? After all he served for over 17 years in a governing body where his influence was unshakeable. Oh, I forgot the 8 years he was second in command of the most powerful nation on earth. The film is happy to show photos of a young Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific article, but did not ask about Clinton's complicity in global warming. Probably too close to an election year, or maybe harming Hillary's chances in 2008. Anyway, he's a political coward and partying to the bitter end. He offers no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no way is the history of industrial development that took us to this point in time. In the end, this film was much more about Mr. O Gore than any real problem our environment faces. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to make a movie campaign - shorten it and call it what it really is.
