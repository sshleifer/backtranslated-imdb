or anyone who was praying for Al Cliver's vision fighting a 7m tall nude black guy in a complete nelson, his movie arrived! Movie actress Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group demanding a $ 6 million bailout to be delivered to her hideout on the island. What they do not count is the rugged Vietnam veteran Peter Weston (Cliver) being hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they did not really count was a local tribe who liked to offer young women to their cannibal god of monsters with bloodshot eyes. <br /> <br /> Almost the same footage made as CANIBAIS, this one comes out a bit better when it comes to entertainment, thanks mainly to hilarious dub track and the incredibly silly monster with bulging eyes (Franco confirms that they were divided into ping-pong balls in the disc interview). Franco gets a strong supporting cast from EuroCult, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the riskiest things I've ever seen when a guy who is not totally he's shown - up close - trying to be him) . The film features tons of nudity and the blood (Tempra variety of paint) is there. The highlight for me was the slow world fight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the speckled waves. Sadly, old Jess grabs this out to an astonishing (and sometimes dying) 1 hour and 40 minutes when he should have run 80 minutes tops. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, Severin's DVD looks really cool, but there are some weird ghost images going on in some of the darkest scenes. Also, a long dialogue section is in Spanish without subs (they are an option, but only when you hear the French track). Franco gives a good 16-minute interview on the film and has a lot more nice things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina Siani.
