No scenery, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Give a budget to do this ... In Belgium, we make ten films that win all prices in Cannes Thereby. <br /> <br /> Last time I saw a NULL movie like that was Hypercube. But the scenery was better. <br /> <br /> Anyone know if the director was trained in school or police film? <br /> <br /> The best things about this movie were the word "End". Why authorize to sell it? 1C is expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> For me, paying for it was my GREAT ERROR of the millennium. <br /> <br /> Sorry. <br /> <br /> Next time I'm going to break my arm, but buy that kind of shit.
