If you have not seen this, I say just move on, take a walk in the park, do not waste your time. Neither the scenery nor the acting are worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can not decide what was worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? The acting talent of Ellen Pompeo is very questionable. I hope she can improve it over time. The plot is simply unbelievable. Loose American cannon cop fighting off criminals in Europe on their own? Infamous Slavic mafiosos protected by only two pieces ??? An emotional art teacher leading an implacable gang? Spanish policeman dumber than a bag of hammers ??? Give me some time. There's only one good thing about this movie: at least production costs should be lower than those for "Ocean's 12," which were as insignificant and exaggerated as this.
