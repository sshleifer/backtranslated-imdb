Much death happens in the wild. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out! But does it have to be the focus of a documentary on nature? What is there with this fascination for horrible death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant shattered by a bunch of hungry lions? Or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought this would be a family movie! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show violent violence in the movie trailers? Were the filmmakers afraid of losing money? <br /> <br /> So, in the typical comic fashion of relief, we can see the magnificent Birds of Paradise perform mating rituals to the most boring and stupid narration that is humanly possible. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed they were just heading to a room full of first and second grade students on a school trip! Wow!! From average to the jerk in the blink of an eye! <br /> <br /> If there are documentary filmmakers about the future nature waiting behind the scenes to read this movie review, why not focus on: Animals actually copulating; giving birth; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; socialization; Playing; emotional manifestations other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors such as mouth meditating; migration; problem solving skills; culture (yes, many species of animals have what humans call culture); communication skills; parenting, healing skills, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or dull beauty, and why not be much more balanced - and focus on pleasure and inspiration?
