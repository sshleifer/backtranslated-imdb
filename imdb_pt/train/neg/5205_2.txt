Minimum script, minimum character development, minimum stable camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache, inducing jerky zooms, maximum characters walking through the forest doing nothing. Until the hour flashes on the screen of 12:01, you can move forward and not miss anything, since there are three hunters who know nothing about doing nothing. To be fair, the movie has some chord music that was interesting, so maybe a music video would have been the way to go. Unfortunately this was not to be, and what should have been a short twenty minutes is extended beyond belief. Forget the "Trigger Man", I know I'm trying. - MERK
