This is only the second time I've interrupted a portion of the video / DVD. <br /> <br /> I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first, even though it was both superficial, clich√©d and stupid .. And without joy, indolent and pretentious. <br /> <br /> It was like an After School Special directed by that strange 9th grade kid who thinks no one understands him ... scary and sad, with narration that only the most deluded teenager would consider poetry ... and some singing, and ... no, really, the poor child's suffering ... <br /> <br /> Enough, especially when it turned into a brazen, clumsy and insulting ripoff. Did I mention the song? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly the one I felt least obliged to watch. I would not recommend it to anyone.
