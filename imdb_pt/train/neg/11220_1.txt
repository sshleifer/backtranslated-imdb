For a movie with so much promise, it was disappointing, poorly planned and acting ranging from horrible to unbelievable. The plot had more holes than Swiss cheese and is the worst clich√© final thing I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene would have ripped out my heart if the whole movie had not been so painful to begin with. I was numb! From the first scene - she wondered if her sister was trying to help her twin sister or just scare her to death, which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of poor performance. we have seen so far. It was a horror in the truest sense of the word.
