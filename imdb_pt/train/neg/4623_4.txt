If you have not seen the TV series gong show, then you will not like this movie much, not that knowing the series make it a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 5 out of 10 because some things make it a little fun to help make up for their obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It's a funny picture of the era in which it was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You have lots of funny appearances from people you saw on the show. 3) It's interesting to see Chuck (the presenter) when he's not doing his personality on television. 4) You can see a lot of bizarre people doing all kinds of weirdness as you see in the TV show. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things because there are many, but here are some of the more prominent. <br /> <br /> 1) Gong Show Movie has many clips from TV shows that get tired for the duration of the movie. 2) The story line of the movie outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically consists of only one plot point. 3) Chuck is actually kind of decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are making the best of the 70s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch when you do not have an hour and a half you want watch at once. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not too bad. But it's still not so good anyway. ;)
