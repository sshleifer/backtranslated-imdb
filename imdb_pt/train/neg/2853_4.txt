Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mafia boss, leaving a mental institution, back to his gangster world. How can a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very handsome), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and make a waste of time? This movie is a comedy that is not funny, having a constellation in the cast. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Pleasure to Kill You!' ("Pleased to kill you!") <br /> <br />
