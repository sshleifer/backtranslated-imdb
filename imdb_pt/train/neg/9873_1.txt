I watched with my mother and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We do not understand anything. I may have this wrong, but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman's father. This movie was terrible! This is not a movie for those who love a good thriller. Bad thriller! * shakes cane in the movie * I'll never see it again. And I'm a big fan of live movies too! They need to stop trying to make movies out of books. You're driving me crazy! <br /> <br /> And Whit was very ugly and yet she loves him more than Hugh, who was a bit TINY cuter. My rating: 1/10
