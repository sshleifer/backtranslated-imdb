I saw this movie a while back on a video CD. <br /> <br /> I will first mention the positives. <br /> <br /> The movie, at the beginning, at least tries to seem like it is not biased, like not showing one character as black and the other as white. Both main characters are friends and coexist very well in a country and an economy that is not growing and at the same time is not failing. Their families get together and have parties and practice their favorite sport, rifle shooting, as comrades and not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But after the first 15 minutes, the plot comes to a fork in the road. The public is expected to believe that, for some unknown reason, these friends should hate themselves. That for some unknown reason, Bosnia is now on a path to conflict. Of course, the script adds in TV footage that the characters seem to be watching live news programs in English, but the clips are from 1993 rather than 1992 when the war began. <br /> <br /> The history, the 1990 elections, the people who caused the war are not mentioned. The film tries to blame Karadzic, who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the 2nd-largest party in the Bosnian Parliament (SDP). According to the Bosnian Constitution, the SDP should have the presidency in 1992, but there was a coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party took full control and held a referendum segregated in March, in which the law was declared in Bosnia and announced the Secession. <br /> <br /> IDAP's story begins with Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a suspicious man missing from "STTH". He was a student of Nazism in World War II. He even wrote his own "Mein Kampf," in which he stated: "In fact, there can be no peace or coexistence between 'the Islamic religion' and non-Islamic social and political institutions." <br /> <In 1990 he lost the IDAP elections to "Moderate Pro-Yugoslavia" Fikret Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim, who worked with Serb Christians during the Civil War, and who treated his supporters as brothers. Abdic was barred from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the elections, but held the seat of power. <br /> <br /> The events above are missing in the film, but they are the facts that led to the war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with props. Serbian soldiers in the film wore Soviet World War II helmets that they did not wear. Also the soldier was holding an M-1944 WW2 rifle used only by the USSR and not by Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and writers had a chance, but they chose to rewrite the story.
