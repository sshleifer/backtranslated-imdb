Cliff Robertson, as a conspirator husband married to a wealthy woman, offers a performance worthy of a joke here, if ever there was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson screams "turn him off, think of zombie, just less excited" through his little megaphone as he trained Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is little better; Jennifer Agutter, of the fame of LOGAN'S RUN, is hardly seen in what should have been developed as a central role. If the quality of the performance was three times better; if some of the more open holes were filled; and if the rhythm were given with a dose of adrenaline, then this yawner could be taken to an acceptable standard for the public of the Hallmark \ Lifetime TV channel. As it is, its rating is so inexplicably high that one can not help but think that chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to regain some of the nap time. Maybe the morning telemarketers are missing out on a great opportunity not to disclose this as such.
