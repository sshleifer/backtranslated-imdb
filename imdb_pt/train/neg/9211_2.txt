This movie reminds me of many of the anti-drug films of the 50s and 60s, because it was made by people who obviously never experienced the social ills that are warning us. Tom Hanks and his friends are role playing, but there's no data, lots of candles, and then you're just dragged into a bad setup showing Hanks falling in love with the lady in the party. very funny but misguided. I wonder how many poor children had their D & D things destroyed, and they said using their imagination was the way to destruction. Like a movie, it's basically a special post-school, a poor performance (though Hanks shows a little of his talent) and conversations about relationships, and no one seems to be having fun. It seems like these films have a psychological focus on teenagers starting on the road to adulthood, which is more serious, apparently, and requires you to commit yourself and do the things that everyone else does. Despite my vote of 2, it's worth watching because of its unique genre, scary movies, which I personally find very funny.
