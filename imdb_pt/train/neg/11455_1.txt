First of all, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedies I liked: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /> <br /> 2007 Comedies I hated: Evan Almighty, Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and turned off the "Hot Rod" after I reached the 20 minute mark. I knew at the time this movie would not make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to break 6 in IMDb. Anyone over the age of 10 who has enjoyed this should be some kind of mental defect. <br /> <br /> That does not come close to Will Farrell and of course Andy Samberg can not take anything but a 5-10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they tied Ian McShane and Isla Fisher in making this movie ... they must have had favors or something. I walked in knowing it would be a stupid movie, but I thought it would be funny at least. I did not do as much as smile. <br /> <br /> I usually do not comment on movies in IMDb, but this was so horrible that I just had to warn people. This is only the fourth movie I saw that I felt compelled to rate 1/10.
