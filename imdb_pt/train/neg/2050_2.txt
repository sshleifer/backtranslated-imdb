Not that "a film by Ulli Lommel" has filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink below my lower expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers to use digital video for their first projects, which is great for giving these kids the opportunity to create a job without spending all their money on expensive movies. But many of these young filmmakers also became aware of the idea of ​​filtering the finished film, so that it looks qualitatively more like the celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the "mockumentary" style because it never looks like anything other than video. Herein lies the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie is like watching a daytime novel about a killer. Does not seem to watch a movie. And what is even more unforgivable is that Lommel is not a young filmmaker. He should know better. He should know that it is virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) On video. For the love of God this guy has been heading since the sixties! He may be the only director who failed to improve over a forty year career in business. And good luck, he wrote the script too! So you can expect complicated actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least a truly pretentious plot element that will make you totally dissatisfied. Please, please, miss this movie. You'll thank me later.
