If Todd Sheets appeared and admitted that this movie was meant to imitate the zombie genre, I would change my rating to eight. Try to imagine a movie in which all the scenes, lines and even all the nuances of acting were designed to be a parody. I could probably crap alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letters, and still have a better script. Two particular scenes come to mind when I think of this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's father and the other parent walk, I repeat, down a staircase full of zombies. This is a small staircase and even if they lean on the undead, nothing happens to them. When they come to an end, the ex-Marine turns, says "God, you're a horny bastard," and shoots only one. The other is in the military complex. The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around her for about forty seconds while she is surrounded by zombies to an arm away. She then casually escapes the crowd and joins the other humans. SPOILER ALERT! These scenes must be seen to be believed. Still, I appreciate this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so funny. Congratulations to Todd Sheets for having so many people in your movie and having the desire to do it, but not for anything else.
