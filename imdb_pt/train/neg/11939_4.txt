Let me tell you something about this movie. I've seen it twice. The first time I was a kid and the movie was a lot of fun for me. I really liked. I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it again a few days ago. It was horrible. Same. I do not know why I thought it was funny before, but now ... I did not laugh at anything. There was nothing fun at all. It was just an idiot. The story was weak. The performance was nothing special. There are great actors in this film, but still the acting is mediocre, at best. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the movie is racist. Same. Do not get me wrong, I usually do not complain about racism in movies. However, I have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like 'The Shaolin Temple' or about the fact that the only black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of the bad guys or ... Anyway, you has the point. There are people seeing racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a movie like 'The Meteor Man'. Because? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white people among the good guys. In fact, there is only one white guy in the whole movie and he is the leader of the bad guys. All the good guys are African Americans. Do not get me wrong, I do not care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What I care about is the fact that we barely see a white person in this movie. This is the only movie I have ever seen. It's not just realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie, which is the case of 'The Street Fighter', no problem - in Japan, most people are Asian. But if there is only one white man in an American movie, there is some sort of problem - in the US, most people are white. It's like filming a Japanese movie with a totally white cast and just an Asian as a bad guy. It just is not real. <br /> <br /> That's it. I'm giving the movie the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I had not enjoyed myself as a child.
