Usually I like horror movies, but unfortunately it fell out of a pound box in my friends hand. We sat down to watch, ready to be scared and end up spraying food everywhere we were laughing a lot. The concept is not so bad, but why they decided that the number ten in the series would be lucky, I do not know. The worst thing about the movie are the actors. The camera work was bad, the special effects are not really bad if I'm being generous but overall the story failed to connect at any level because the actors were as effective as a small piece of battered helm. They were wooden beyond measure, especially a frivolous young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent. He looked more like a public school kid indeed. There was a very entertaining sex scene where he seemed to be swinging for apples as a busty lady rode on top of him and then his diaper-sized underwear was hysterical but then I remembered it should not be a comedy. I'm desperately ruining my brain to find something positive to say about this movie besides the occasional breasts flash, but there simply is not. Let's hope that ten is the lucky number and they do not make another, I'm not sure if my ribs hold out.
