Friday the 13th step is over! There is officially a movie worse than your odious series out there. I won this movie in a college contest, and it was a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones stars as a truly horrible singer whose attempt to find some killers or something. At least Friday the thirteenth never bored me. I'd rather have my nails ripped than see it again.
