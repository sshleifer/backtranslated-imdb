Users who rated this movie very simply might not have seen enough good movies to compare it. Were they all brainwashed? I've rarely felt so disappointed in a movie and some of it should be attributed to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie. From the outset, BU is just a chase movie. We pick up at the end of a chase and go straight to another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern emerging? There is virtually no "wasted" time in the plot, character development or old boring reality. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the other two Bourne films yet, you're very lost. If you have - you just WANT it is lost - somewhere far from the movies. The dispassionate style of Paul Greengrass worked exceptionally well on United 93, which was a desperate overload of feelings to happen, but in Bourne and his endless misfortunes it only has the effect of removing the public from involvement with the character. He runs. He jumps. He punches. He is blown up. He cleans tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he survives. He survives as a man of plastic action survives, which only makes the ridiculous acrobatics that he pulls even looser and without any kind of tension. So he runs a building? And? He will survive. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interest died in an earlier incarnation, but she's just a decoration. I have seen more depth of character and harsh dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is boring and informative and does not tell us anything we did not know about the first film. It was turned into a killing machine. Great deal. He discovers his true identity. And? It has no emotional resonance when it arrives. <br /> <br /> The end of the 'twist' is wired and weak. Oh, honey, the more I think about this movie, the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 while writing this review! I'd better finish it now before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I love a good action movie and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither. It's a tall, tedious series of flashy editions, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that "shows the way" to the Bond franchise is total crap. Casino Royale blows out of the water.
