Well, Jesus from Montreal is basically a smart movie. The actors are really good and the technical side of the movie is fine. But although I was very interested in the subject and liked to think and argue about religion (I'm an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and, in my opinion, somehow unconsciously, the funny ending. Why is this movie so incredibly annoying? I do not know. It just is and therefore is not recommended.
