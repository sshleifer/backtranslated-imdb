This has to be the most brutally dull "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken as a crazed beggar CAN NOT make me laugh? Something has to be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I've ever wanted to leave. I used free passes and still felt like I wanted my money back. I can honestly say that the only movie I've ever seen worse than this was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. O. ONLY. worse. movie. I laughed very lightly at the carousel scene and that's it. Spending 2 hours on something like a comedy should give you more of a laugh, right? I do not know, I think the filmmakers thought "pudding" was a funny word or something. And the other running joke is really beating a dead horse - literally.
