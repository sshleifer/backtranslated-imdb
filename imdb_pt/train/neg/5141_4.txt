1914 was an incredible year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in movies and he appeared in over 30 movies! While most of these movies were not particularly good, they gave him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona. However, for this film, the familiar character "Little Tramp" was still in development. Of course Charlie looked the part, but his character still did not have the sweetness and decency that he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often knocked, kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all. <br /> <br /> As for this very light film, it is interesting to watch the cast. While they are not familiar today, Chaplin stars along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this movie is that although it has some nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and poorly developed. Chester and Mabel arrived on the race track (a theme very common in Keystone productions - it must have been located near a race track). Charlie and Mack appear and infiltrate. Mack is chased by the police for doing this while Charlie hits Chester and steals his girl. In the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack away - leaving Charlie with Mabel (who, strangely enough, does not seem to have been brushed aside by Charlie's coarse behavior). <br /> <br /> Unless you're a great movie historian or comedy film, this is a very forgettable movie that's only important in Chaplin's evolution. What he and the other actors do on stage, while not uncommon for a Keystone movie, is not particularly funny when seen today.
