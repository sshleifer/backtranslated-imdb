I sincerely consider this film as another bad effort of the Dominican Cinema Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a bit funny, but when they change roles in society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie falls. Becoming annoying and not funny. They leave many things unexplained and the end of the film is predictable. I did not like the way a Roberto Angel played his character and his little one too. I went to the movies expecting to see a good job, but I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
