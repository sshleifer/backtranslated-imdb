We rented five movies for the New Year's weekend and watched this first. All I can say is that there was no place to go but after watching this. It was useless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's script must have been easy to write - just make every two words a curse word. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good at a character, but the movie has nothing more to recommend it.
