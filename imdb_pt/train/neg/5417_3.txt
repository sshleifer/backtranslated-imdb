Three Russian aristocrats absorb the decadence of Monte Carlo, although they are in the last franc. To support their luxurious lifestyle, all three use the services of a forger and use the notes at the casinos, hoping to exchange the counterfeit currency for a grand prize. Andrew Hughes, a US envoy, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three decide to make friends with visitors, hoping for financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sérgio Karamzin, plans to go further, steadily advancing towards Helena, while at the same time disappointing the earl of the earl, who loves Sérgio. Eventually, circumstances throw their hands against the three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the American women's foolishness and the improper behaviors of the aristocrats), rather than telling a story, and the film really can upset modern audiences like me by easily doing so. Even the acting, which is great in later EvS like Greed and the Wedding March, is just a mill run here. The film could have used improvements on several levels. Evaluation, 3.
