A mess of squashy antics posing as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull riding champion who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home in Arizona, where government robes have just invested in the family's (desperately in need of a stallion) herd. What director Peter Tewksbury is needing is some narrative skills, despite what he lacks in valuing valuing in sloppy comedy mounts (his social commentary is not exactly pointed, but Tewksbury has a satirical lean for his fancier and there are some scenes funny). Despite the colorful supporting curves of Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, general insanity is out of control, and there is a lot of noise and suspense to keep much interest. As for Elvis, he's loose and playful all over - and while it's cool to see him having fun on the screen, you have to wonder if he'd given up on the movies right now. This confusion of an image has a distinct sense of what hell is, and although the spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. * 1/2 of ****
