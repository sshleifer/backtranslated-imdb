I'll say it again: this movie was totally stupid. Children will surely like it, but adults ... doubtful. The whole thing was basically a replay of the original, which is to be expected, since they practically explored the whole concept in the first film, but still, they had to completely redo the whole movie? I mean, everything is done again from the Little Mermaid. The worst part is Morgana's "crazy sister to Ursula" who appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous, since Triton is there with his magic trident. Why did not Triton do anything about it? Because the plot required him to do nothing. I could go on, but I will not. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to raise more money from the Little Mermaid, and was obviously thrown together without any thought, because they knew it would sell. Overall, it's a terrible waste of time.
