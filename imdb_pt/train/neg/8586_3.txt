What a disappointment ... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of stopped pieces, poorly performed and united amateur. There are numerous errors of continuity that clash with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was treated so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now a joke that will be ridiculed for many years. I'm not going to complain about the abysmal dialogue, since this is Star Wars ... the three original films had style, sense of worship and compelling stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and that lack of love shows in spades. Totally disappointing.
