I get annoyed with Shakespeare's modern adaptations when the director can not decide whether to use the original or update it. If you are using the original words in an updated configuration, this is particularly tricky if it is defined in the 20th or 21st century, although it may work well in period styles, for example Trevor Nunn's Night of Kings, set at the end of the Victorian era , very effective. It could work with the scenario of the thirties if there was much less music and dancing and much more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a rather trivial show, though very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the students, but more importantly, he is such an experienced Shakespearean actor that despite all his efforts to be just another student, his acting force shows all the time. Of course he should have played the king - it's okay to have a mature student king surrounded by young students. Instead, we had a nice actor, but not imposing, for the king, therefore, a king called unimposing no real attributes. <br /> <br /> The amount of music and dance, which I found boring despite cool songs and nice dancing, unfortunately meant that Shakespeare's great dialogue had to be drastically reduced. So the whole thing turns out to be a light, trivial outfit, and I got really bored, even with the comic twists, and I was happy when that was over. Branagh did not do justice to Shakespeare in this production. <br /> <br /> Praise, however, of Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely splendid as the eldest couple.
