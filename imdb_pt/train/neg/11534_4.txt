* WARNING * Contains MANY SPOONS! <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I have tremendous respect for Gillian Anderson's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress - and that is why I can not understand your reasons for agreeing to do so. film, once she saw the script (or lack thereof). <br /> <br /> The premise of the film was, in my opinion, a great idea and there were some genuinely thought-provoking themes there, but it ended up like a collapsed souffl√©. This exemplifies why I hate 99% of British cinema. It seems very long, it's tedious for the most part, and it does not happen much after the first twenty minutes. Just when you think there is a chance to catch some speed, she disappoints like Paula Radcliffe running a marathon. With little imaginative direction and a minimalist storyline, there is not much to stop the audience from sleeping on their popcorn. As for the script, I can only assume that the writer was trying to save some trees, with the average scene reading something like "Alice: F *** OFF! ! ADAM! "I suspect that, word for word, the actors probably received more than Kate Moss for their Virgin Mobile ads. The few lines there was not much variation with the frequent use of the word f that would make Bridget Jones's friend Shazza proud. There is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event that leaves the public without much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic reaction "Oh, this is terrible." <br /> <br /> Alice is not the kind of woman that courts sympathy wants. She has a great job, an expensive apartment in London, with room to ceiling to die for, but she shows on the screen how vain, bitter and unsatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worse. After the attack, some layers are peeled, which explains why it is so begins; She grew up with a tough soldier who thought that teaching her to shoot with her gun was the ultimate expression of love, so instead of following in her footsteps, she fled to the big city in search of something to make her feel as if it were worth living. Instead, he encountered a stereotyped group of middle-class Toffs who disparage someone who is not rich enough to drive a Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security / entertainment system (becoming Mrs. Robinson for an electrician of Cockney). Someone give me a tissue. The saving grace of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a minor actress, she would have been intolerably one-dimensional, but Mrs. Anderson really succeeds in injecting some fleeting moments of humanity into that lifeless human being, most notably when she is sincerely apologizing for her rage in the vain attempt. to prevent its attackers from continuing the attack. <br /> <br /> I can not say that Adam did much better too. Danny Dyer played well with Jack the Laden, but a good performance could not save him from the lack of a script and the total absence of any character. <br /> <br /> This movie was mostly based on shock value, but the time was wrong and looked very resourceful from start to finish. As for the shock, the most shocking thing about this movie is the shameless demonstration of how painfully thin Ms Anderson has become; It was almost as disturbing to see as the brutal attack scenes. On a side note, only in a British movie would a gang of violent sex offenders take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to applaud their mates - talk about the stiff upper lip taken to the extreme! If this is the kind of movie the National Lottery is donating money to make, then I'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound every week. <br /> <br /> To say that I hated this movie is to give a lot of credit, I did not care enough about any of the characters to ensure such a strong emotion. I want that one-and-a-bit hours of my life back, please!
