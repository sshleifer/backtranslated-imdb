What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days earlier I had watched Lillies and this was one of the best Gay movies I have ever seen. So this was not the best time to watch a mediocre gay movie. <br /> <br /> The story was silly and the acting was good. It was not bad enough to hang up, but had some bad times and some terrible stereotypes. It also was not very well launched. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this movie? No, you would be wasting your time and money. I do not understand why movies like these are made and who finances them. Spend your time Watching Noah's Arc in the Logo. I think this is where this movie was trying to go, but it never got there.
