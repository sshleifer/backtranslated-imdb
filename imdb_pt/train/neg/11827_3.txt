I just came back from a free exhibition and I'm really glad I did not get paid to see this very insignificant movie. The theater was full and the crowd was a mixture of children and adults. It seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap jokes and fart jokes (good god they loved to hit those poor mice in the groin a lot!). The film is very youthful, unintelligent, predictable and, most of the time, annoying. The characters seem to be thrown together to fill the empty space and the relationships between all seemed very forced, without any charm. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is about average with nothing that really stands out. They did a decent job mimicking the look of Wallace and Gromit's clay, but otherwise that's a very forgettable image. <br /> <br /> Although I was really bored throughout the movie, I laughed a few times. It's not an absolute flop, but I definitely would not want to watch it again. If you are a parent with children (and you do not mind your children seeing jokes), feel free to take them to see them, but others should not waste your money.
