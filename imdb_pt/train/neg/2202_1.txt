This movie makes me think that the others I saw with Combs were an accident. The plot had more holes than I think I have ever seen in a movie that claims to be something more than a "b" movie. The performance was so laughable that not even memories of Combs' exaggerated triumphs were enough to save him. Considering the script, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I'm completely annoyed that I paid Blockbuster's prices for this junk. The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and, frankly, something that the poor man's movies should be forced to warn him about. Avoid this movie no matter what.
