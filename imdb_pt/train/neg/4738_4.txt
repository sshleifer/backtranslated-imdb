I loved watching the original Azumi with its live-action manga mix, engaging storyline, cool soundtrack, direction (Kitamura rocks!), Editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the piece perfectly. So I was really looking forward to see Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like I had won the lottery and lost the ticket :( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi stopped, however these are completely two different films. is much slower, the action is not so exciting and choreographed and there is not much character development, it was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO franchise (if that's possible!) I agree with some other reviewers who say this was a missed opportunity. If Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this plot. There are however some beautiful Japanese forest landscapes to look at as the slow action unfolds and we are introduced very briefly to characters who are quickly killed, until even the bad guys are killed easily, without much fighting The fight with the spider face (straight from an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about onl and ce while in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cover camera !! Azumi's agitation in the end was not convincing, but Aya still does a good job. She looks great on the cover ... but where did she get that? I do not think I'll be watching this again and again! ...what a pity.
