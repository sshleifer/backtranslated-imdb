The movie was terrible! Easily the worst movie I've seen in years. One of those films I can tell people for the next three years that was the worst movie I can imagine. Thanks for giving me an answer to that burning question, "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" Answer: Prophecy Celestina. Trust me ... I read the book, I liked the message and I was excited to see the movie, but they treated the audience as if we were sad. There is no story and the history that is there is undermined by much magic and coincidence. It's a shame they have to spell out the nine prophecies and can not simply wrap them in a story that is fun to follow. They did not spend any time developing the character and it was easy not to call if any character died. It was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stayed around until the end of this incredibly annoying movie. The book is very annoying too, but I liked the parallels that could be seen in everyday life as you read the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I suggest not to see if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me.
