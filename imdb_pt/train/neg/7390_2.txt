How do you spell Italian fat that can barely make a martial arts move without heart medication? In this film, we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of achievement - ever since his career began, it has been a steady decline in pathetic and indulgent behavior that has scared away his career. In this movie, it seems that most of his training consisted of ordering the alfredo fetuccini in his restaurant every day. <br /> <br /> He's fat, slow and very old looking in this movie, hardly a martial arts action hero, more like a laughing clown. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to retire, this movie is about 2 hours of reasons. <br /> <br /> Plot: Fat Italian guy with a great reputation the force knows that a criminal group may be playing with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate response of the warrior. This pretense, while pathetic and laughable, gives opportunity to some of the most important fighting scenes, which include blasting walls like a comic book. <br /> <br /> I mentioned that this movie sucks and that Steven Seagal is a complete joke? yea. I made.
