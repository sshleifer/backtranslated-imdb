OK - ADORE this movie ... I'm going to credit this movie - alone - for making me a horror fanatic. I could never watch this movie alone. I also heard a lot of stories about the effect it had on its original release in theaters, on its viewers. Incredible masterpiece .... Horrible, psychological things scares the pants of me. Oh bless your hearts, who made this incredible movie. I love it. I thought the whole movie was decent and interesting. This movie is so scary - this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life! Not that what happens in the movie and the idea of ​​the movie are not scary enough, but what has always attracted me - was Brendan's fabulous performance. Best horror movie. Nothing can be so scary again. Halloween to see at its most wicked.
