I have to admit that the draw for this film is director Eduardo Sanchez, who directed the popular and successful Blair Witch Project. Also, this is a kind of alien movie, and it sounded something like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that the critics hated, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> But no, unfortunately I felt that most of the time Changed is a waste of time, so I will keep this review short. The premises are always promising, and Altered is no different. It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger and, as usual, others will take you like a madman imagining things. Stories about abduction by aliens always have to deal with probes in the holes, so I will not go into detail, but you realize it's very uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget. <br /> <br /> What if you got a chance for revenge? That is, you can successfully hunt and catch a live. What will you do? For this group, it's a joyful comeback time, or so they thought. And that's where the film begins to turn into a suspense, with a bad dialogue and uninspired, and even an even worse performance. Even with low budget, there are not many redeeming factors, be it the strength of the plot, or any help from the cast to make your characters a little interesting. It's the standard cardboard fare of a simple vanilla script along with some cheap bullying tactics employed. <br /> <br /> What is good, though, is makeup. A lot of effort has been put into doing some of the things I would not mention, because this will ruin just a few elements of what makes this movie bearable. Other than that, there are cheap, bloody special effects and bloody moments that are nothing you've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> See this only as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in town - Party, this is less fun, and takes itself very seriously. Stranded in an uninspiring direction, you were warned.
