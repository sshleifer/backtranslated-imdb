In Bridgeport, confused high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed with teenage student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she witnesses him killing his family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to jail for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna is feeling better, but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. On her graduation night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged on the same floor of the hotel that is chasing Donna, stabbing his friends and staff from the hotel that crosses his path. <br /> <br /> The forgettable bar "Prom Night" is a collection of clich√©s with total lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and silly, with a poor performance by Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer. The predictable script is incredible, since it is possible to predict what will happen in the next scenes. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Death Invites to Dance" ("Death Invites to Dance")
