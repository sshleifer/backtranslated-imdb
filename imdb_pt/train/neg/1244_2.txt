This is a first step for me, the first time I was disappointed with a Tim Burton movie. POTA is not a bad movie (great scenery, costumes and a great performance), but it could have been done by any Hollywood director. The pace was very strange, the last third was spent waiting for the end of the movie, alone and with the cast. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the movie. Come back Tim.
