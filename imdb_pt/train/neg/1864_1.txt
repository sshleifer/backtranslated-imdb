I may not be a critic, but here is what I think of this movie. Well, I just watched the film in the cinemax and before all I just have to say how much I hate the plot, I mean, what a snowman scares apart from small children, second is very bloody, but I bet the film is so low budget they probably used ketchup, so my critical vote is bomb !!! good try and the sequel will suck double.
