I expect the same enthusiasm from SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, but I was disappointed with just rubbish, as you might call it movie (it's kind of a mini-porn). This made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business. No story line for this swims quickly from every murder. If you like to see naked women or even men, there are places in the movie and there is even a masturbation spot in the movie that makes it a porn movie and not a movie. I've seen some stupid movies in my time, but this is number 1. I want to be watching everyone again. The actors even seem bored during the movie for me, so they were probably in dire need of money to make this movie.
