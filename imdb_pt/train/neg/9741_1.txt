(spoilers) The truly memorable part of this part of British cuisine is Steiner's henna, one of the worst dyeing jobs ever. That and the magnificent old man's eyebrows trying to steal Steiner's invention. The MST3K does an admirable job of making a gray, boring and sad movie. I particularly like it when Crow kills Mike with his 'touch of death', and when he revives him in the movies, Mike cries, "Guys, I died, I saw eternal truth and beauty! disappointment, having to return from the afterlife to watch the rest of The Projected Man. The film could make a fortune being sold as sleep aide. Some of the movie's puns were bad: police inspector - "electrocution!" Crow- "Shocking, is not it?" Police Inspector - "That's OK" Tom Servo- "Very low, right on the floor!" police inspector "Can I come in?" Tom Servo - "He's dead, but he's done with you." The MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this scare.
