What a horrible movie! The idea of ​​robots struggling with each other is cool, but the plot is ridiculous, real human action laughable, acting non-existent, and special effects (of which this type of film must depend) are archaic. I thought it should have been done around '80 -'84 and I was amazed to see it was from 1990. That's 5 years after Aliens! OK, a lot of people said it was good considering the low budget, but I just think 'what's the point?'. seems totally unbelievable. I would not mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely rewritten story because I still like the idea of ​​giant robots hitting each other.
