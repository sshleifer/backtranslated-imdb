I can not believe this movie was created. I think at times the director is trying to make it an artistic piece, but this only makes the situation worse. The zombies look like they applied a lot of makeup to their eyes. The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there are maybe five or six zombies in total, definitely not a nation. The best part of the film if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally completed. Again to reiterate other comments from users, voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense throughout the film. Also, there is a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl that just does not make sense. This is never explained.
