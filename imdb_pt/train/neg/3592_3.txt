For a number of fans, I must admit that Hidden Frontier is not that bad. But, the review of this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Creativity too. I think they are people with common jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But, doing all that work. Pulling all those features. Taking all this time, and still all these failures. <br /> <br /> First, the acting and the lines are terrible. For the majority. The dialogues belong to a 1970s military show, not Star Trek. The captain (Mr. Squinty) seems to be about to burst out laughing at any moment. And most of the characters are just reading their lines. Principals should be aware of the fact that "resume" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also think the series are made in the form of "Two Takes Frakes," which directed many of TNG's episodes and films. Also, I could not help but think that most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without going into this hypothesis. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern with the entire project is the quality of the releases. When they decided to spend so much time and resources on this series - why not have made them available in decent quality? Using the fast time format with low low resolution is a waste of talent. Even the "hygienic" episodes are considered poor quality compared to the standard quality series. Using the Xvid codec, with a higher resolution and file size, would have improved the mass experience. If the troubled band was the problem, setting up a torrent tracker would have solved that. <br /> <br /> Let's hope the team decides to brush the series, and maybe release it on DVD, giving it the quality of the project. deserve.
