This is a movie about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a one-night stand and declares it to be a love story. Of the ten monologues, I felt that only three actually had some kind of real ring through them. I kept waiting for the movie to improve, and it was a bit, but never better. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I always wanted it to be good, but it was never successful. Maybe if it was really love stories, it would have worked.
