Christopher Durang must have been taught by a memorable nun because he simply can not let go of the concept. The play, "Sister Mary Ignatius explains it all to you," was presented - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone as Diane Keaton's lecture scenes. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a satire, a bitter satire of a religious serenely confident, doctrinaire, and highly critical - and played by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration seriously - while, as mentioned, it keeps the same tone in the "explain everything" scenes. The two approaches collide head and in the last twenty minutes, the film leaves the lane, plunges into the throat and explodes. There are no survivors. It might have worked if the tone of the scenes with the four ex-students and the meeting with Sister Mary had been cast in the same way as the scenes of Sister Mary. Or if the scenes of Sister Maria were presented in a more realistic way. This way, it just does not work at all.
