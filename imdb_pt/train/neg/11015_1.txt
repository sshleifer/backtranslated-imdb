I stupidly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie at Best Buy about a year ago, and said to myself, "It looks funny, plus there's Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I continued to pay $ 15.99 plus tax for this. I took it to a friends house and we were both horrified at how badly it was written and acted. Wooden performances are plentiful. All the promised "hilarious" and "remarkable" performances never seemed to come. After 90 minutes, I bowed my head in shame, knowing that I would never get those 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I literally almost cried too, because if that were what could be considered "comedy" I did not want to believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours about the horror of this film to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was. During the holiday season this year I watched with him because he did not want to watch alone. This was my next horrible mistake, because while I watched, I was angry. I started screaming at the movie and I'm not talking about the period of the movies. Everyone I know who even glimpsed this movie agreed it's the worst they've ever seen. My sense of humor is sickly and distorted and often offends my friends, but this could not save this movie really. The fact that this movie is not on the list of Top 100 in IMDb is surprising. The fact that its classification (at the time of writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
