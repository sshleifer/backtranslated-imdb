The plot was rewritten several times; "a breath of life in the nursing home." Various plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news articles have surpassed the subject, but it is still an excellent platform for character studies. If Gideon were created more enthusiastically, it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully annoying and the story is absolutely swamped with cliches (even the subtitle and summary of Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost made me laugh at his ineffectiveness). The predominantly indifferent performance is the last straw for this weak film, but the rest is soft enough to make the actors' lack of focus almost irrelevant.
