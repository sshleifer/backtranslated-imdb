I saw this not long ago, and I must say: this movie is terrible. I watch bad movies for fun. Scarecreow is not fun. The scarecrow is stupid. You have an incredibly cheesy villain who likes to scream terrible puns when he kills his victims (actually worse than contained in this sentence). He has his bad luck story that he uses to justify his deaths. "Everybody likes me, the only girl who thinks I'm not trailer trash likes one of the guys I like, I want to kill everyone." Okay, I'm exaggerating. But the premise for this movie is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of low quality movies. <br /> <br /> Adding to what I just said, the child's mother is promiscuous, he enters his mother and his current boyfriend, mother's boyfriend tells him to leave, boy refuses, insisting he will not leave your own home. Boyfriend chases boy on corn field. He kills boy right in front of his mother, mother screams in terror, boyfriend is like, "OMG! I did not want to!" So he tells his mother not to tell the police about it. Kid was killed under a scarecrow, however. Then, like any child who is murdered under a scarecrow, he returns as a striking killer with a vengeance. His victims "were not persecuted like this before ..." (official scarecrow slogan) To make matters worse, this film was filmed in an impressive 8 days. That's right, 8 days. I was going to give this movie a 2, because after all, it has one or two redeeming moments. (They're spoilers, so I'm not going to ruin it for you if you really want to see that crap.) I could have forgiven you for the bad acting, the horrible special effects, the abysmal script and the bad camera job, but I simply I have no respect for the lack of effort at this level. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as I'm trying to be. If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, or if you like watching bad movies, like I do, then watch this at your own risk. Everyone else should stay a safe distance from this movie at all times.
