Some movies are so bad they are good. This clearly is not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was as true to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible, the direction was bad and he was traveling very fast. It was as if the director wanted to get this over with and go home. <br /> <br /> Nor did Melissa Joan Hart ever seem like a talented actress, but every movie she did was pretty low. budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she disappoints her characters, preventing them from talking too much, speaking too fast, as if hastening her words to become more dramatic. She really brings the feeling that there is a team in front of her and she is talking to a camera when she should be involving the viewer in her character. He pretty much loses the whole movie, and any leg he left standing up is ruined. <br /> <br /> Probably the only good thing about the movie is when it was caught in the end. But even that was not satisfactory enough to subjugate my aversion to such a bad movie. See if your taste for film is softer than a piece of dry toast.
