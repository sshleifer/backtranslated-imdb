This movie was horrible in the worst way: you just did not care. You did not care what happened in the plot; You did not care about the characters. Everyone was heartless. I ended up leaving about 45 minutes because I just did not want to put my mind to it anymore. There's a lot of sex in the movie. Sex can be fine; may even make the film (hence the Karma Sutra), but the relationship here was not pretty or sexy. It was just ugly. I do not see this movie.
