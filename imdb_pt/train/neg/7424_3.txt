A very, very monotonous movie here with Stella Stevens taking in directions from someone in disguise (not long to guess who it was) in Old Nevada Town outside of Las Vegas for a cash theft at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens leads her three-girl gang and they find they must act much faster than anticipated. Despite some neat stares in Las Vegas in the 1970s, a very average but credible performance of the most involved, and a plot with potential, the Lady of Las Vegas places a big annoying egg. It always seems like the film fits, and when that happens, it just shakes here and there and never accelerates. I was a bit disappointed with this movie. Of course, I was not expecting anything good, but at least I thought this could be one of those 1970s exploration films or something. Not even close. No one dies. There is a lame shooting between the raucous Stuart Whitman and the offensive George DiCenzo, a year before his great performance as Bugliosa promoter in Helter Skelter. The shooting has all the suspense of watching a waterfall. There is a punch and a blow to the head with a blunt instrument. Plus nothing in terms of action. And as for the girls, do not expect too much there. Stella and her girls (both very mediocre, but very talented, go into a sauna and bath.) Stella wears these beautiful open sweaters accentuating her true talents, but I wish she had been a little more open with her performance, so I could write something that would recommend the movie, but it would not be, and I have little to say in favor of the film, it's not a horrible movie at all. .
