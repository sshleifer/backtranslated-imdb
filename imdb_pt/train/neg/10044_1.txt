This is the biggest failure of 2008. I do not know what the Director has in mind when creating such a disaster. The songs were added without situations, the story was stretched to fill the 3 hour gap and the most disgusting are the action tricks performed by the actors, it's as if everyone is having superpowers that can be executed between the bullets and nothing happens to them and a person struggling with 100 people. Only the best performance was made by the man of Anil Kapoor, he is at all times at his best playing villain role with a comic act speaking Hinglish ... Akki is also done a good job ... But the film just forgets .
