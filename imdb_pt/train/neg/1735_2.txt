I have the impression that the producers of this mess were willing to make the western more painful and ridiculous of all time. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, you have a good color photograph and the beautiful and well spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who acted well enough in an annoying role, written so atrociously that no actor could give a pleasant performance. The production values ​​were very good, which only served to highlight the terrible story and the script. Things I Hated: Stewart Granger looked as small as a Western figure in his British accent, well-made clothes, and a white, immaculate scarf tied around his neck. It was tiring as the people of the town and his son were constantly lecturing and insulting Granger, and he never spoke or answered back. I know we should suspend disbelief and appreciate the Farosest as symbolic pieces of morality, but this broke the spell with ridiculously unreal and predictable scenes, the worst being at the end where Granger miraculously, quickly and alone plant dynamite around a gorge pass the The villain's cattle will pass, and then Granger plant in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very large distance to create rock slides to bury and scare the cattle and the villains, apparently destroying them all except the two main villains . Then the worst is all about the plot, which is loaded with novel scenes. Nothing in the film seemed believable: I could not believe what the whole conflict was. The villain was directing his flock to the market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way; I do not see why something could not have been solved. Do you need a land tenure dispute for this? Do not bother to see this.
