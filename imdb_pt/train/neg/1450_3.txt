If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, read the history of World War I and not the history of World War II. Find out what happened during that war, how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time. How many soldiers went mad, than they saw during World War I, at the time they called it "shock shock," now called post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the true horrors of World War I, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a human being can become insensible to death, not because of his evil, but simply because it is the only way for them to deal with the horrors around them. <br /> <br /> This movie unfortunately misses this. so many others do. Read a few books on the subject and you should watch the movie "Paths of Glory," the only good movie ever made in World War I. You will see the soldiers' frustration in that film, the feeling of helplessness and a total devaluation of human life, like nothing more than hunting bullets. <br /> <br /> That's what this movie is missing, it's really the key point of understanding Germany. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives for no real reason. Then comes a total economic collapse, after the war. These are the factors that create extremism. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and massive poverty will always create extremism. Unfortunately this movie ignored these factors, and has just become another piece of junk to play on the stack. With really no real value, there are fictional films based on fictional characters that could give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than that. They just played Hitler's name to sell more.
