I'm a big fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell far short of my expectations. I hoped a Heavy Metal 2000 would be kind of ... slow, bad dialogues, a lot of blood ... but that was worse than anything I could imagine. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost the same as the comics, but the positives almost stop there. The characters do not have the energy or the spirit that caught my eye in the comic book series. The film covers only a small part of the comics, and the part used is slower and flatter than the backs. The film's focus is on insignificant events instead of the most interesting general storyline in the comic book. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could have been incredible. Unfortunately, it was not so, so now there is another terrible movie that few summer and less will still love. My copy will surely accumulate dust for years until I finally throw it away.
