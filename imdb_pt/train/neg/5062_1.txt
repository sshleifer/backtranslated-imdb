This movie is bizarre. Better put, it's "weird". I could give you a summary of the plot, or some analysis of toity hoity, but I would consider it a waste of your time. All one needs to know about this movie are two young sisters, an incestuous relationship, homicide, post mortem mutilation and a really disturbing passion. At the end of the movie, you feel like you need to take a shower to wash the dirt off of yourself, but not in a good way, like after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club." It's like you're a teenager (or high school I'm still a teenager) and I just did something to you A: I wish you had not, and B: wait for the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out. And nobody likes it. My advice is that instead of messing with your mind and watching scenes of filthy dirt, simply waste your time on something a little less horrible and see "Kazaam" (yes, I'd rather watch "Kazaam" than "Assassin Assassins", read what you want).
