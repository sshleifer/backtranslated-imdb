Robert Taylor definitely proved to be a terrific dramatic actor in his role as an armed buffalo hunter in the late 1956s. It was one of the few times Taylor played heavy on a movie. However, this image was far from great, shortly thereafter, Taylor fled to the television with the hit series The Detectives. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned into a formidable performance as Taylor's partner. <br /> <br /> Taylor is a fanatic here and his hatred for the Indians really shows. Another very good performance here was veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an elderly veteran joined the buffalo hunt as well. In his early scenes, Nolan was actually making an excellent takeoff from Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasury of the Sierre Madre in 1948. Notice the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film. The following year, Tamblyn and Nolan would join the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> The writing on the film is hard, at best. At the end of the film, it is the elements of nature that made Taylor. And the elements of writing here?
