Chillers begins on a cold, dark stormy night when a bus leaves three passengers outside a bus station, a boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a college professor Dr. Howard Conrow (David Wohl) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside they find that they have missed the connecting bus and are stuck overnight. In the waiting room they meet two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons) who is having a terrible nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in an indoor Lindsay pool & befriends guy named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), the next time Lindsay sees Billy he dives into the pool and then apparently disappears into the air before he surfaces. Shortly after, Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a diving accident five years ago ... <br /> <br /> Lindsay wakes up and tells others about her nightmare, everyone responds saying that they too have had some disturbing dreams recently. and decides to share them to pass the time ... <br /> <br /> Next is Mason, who tells a story of how he and two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) and Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller) are terrified during a camping trip ... <br /> <br /> So it's Sharon whose story revolves around a journalist named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal) with whom she phones, at no time is Tom at the front door , but he actually turns out to be a vampire ... <br /> <br /> It's Ronnie's next time and he describes how he finds out he can bring the dead back to life, unfortunately he brings killer in Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll) Back to homicidal life ... <br /> <br /> Finally, Dr. Conrow tells how two of his students brought an ancient Aztec war god named Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo ur) back to life ... <br /> <br /> Then he returns to the bus station for one last touch (predictable) ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed gone by Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies I've ever seen and I usually really like this subgenre. Boyd's script does not have what it takes for movies like Chillers to work, you can see the final twist coming a mile away and every story is really ridiculous. The first one is totally meaningless and does not seem to have an ending and the best thing about these anthologies are the short stories that are completed with a cool twist. The second story is predictable and, again, ends without any return. So it continues throughout Chillers that every story is deeply unsatisfactory to watch and has no reward for it. The character and dialogue are poorly written, the stories seem to have no original ideas and, as a whole, the movie sucks. At least every story does not last long and I liked the idea behind the link segments. Director Boyd was obviously working on a very low budget and this shows. All I can say is that if you want to watch an odd 15 minute tale set entirely within a pool, then Chillers is for you. Stories are not clever, scary, or have any kind of tension or are built for anything. Having said that he has some nice scenes and some amazing skill shines from time to time. Violence and good sense there is not much happening in Chillers, a heart plucked, a head decapitated and a hand out bite is as bloody as it gets. <br /> <br /> Technically Chillers is poor thing that will not impress anyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and below-average production figures. Chillers also features one of the worst theme song closing of all time, period. The performance is also of a very low standard. <br /> <br /> I'm sure a lot of effort was put into the Chillers as a low budget movie and at least the filmmakers tried it, so I would give credit for it at least, but that still does not stop me from thinking that sucks. Similar anthology films such as Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) Chillers, then watch one of these.
