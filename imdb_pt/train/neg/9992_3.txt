Ah yez, the Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another disgusting movie. I was particularly taken in by the scenes immediately after the accident, where as the survivors searched desperately for matches, at least half a dozen fires burned? for no apparent reason ?? at various points in the wreckage. Fire seemed to be a prevailing theme everywhere. They searched corpses for lighters and matches and finally found a box built daily for a fire, apparently 12, but no one ever gathered lumber. So when the vegan (hah) burned the bodies, what did she use for an accelerator? I mean, these guys were frozen? well maybe not. Despite the apparent low temperature, whatever the yeti ate, it bled. Maybe it's just me, but even in a totally unbelievable tale (none of the survivors ever heard of a yeti, or an abominable snowman, till the end), if you take care of the little things, bigger deals become more acceptable. Oh, what does the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the movie? And the revolver, warm enough to hold in his hand, froze and did not fire. Gimme a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminently lovely Canadian girl. And with little irony, Ed Marinaro as coach. Well, I might add that the rabbit they ate (though it looks like a chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now, if it had been a squirrel (or a rat), it would have been a rodent, but it still looked like a chicken. And the writers lost a real chance to have someone jot down "It tastes like ..."
