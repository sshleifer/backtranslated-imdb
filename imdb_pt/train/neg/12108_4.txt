I just had to write that lining, but that's right. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I've seen in years. I have compliments to everyone involved in most aspects, except the most important, the script. It's a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of fine action or black-and-white film style can make up for a total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I heard that he will make another film about the general. My advice is do not waste your time.
