... which is not exactly an endorsement. Overall, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Of course, in that movie Matt Borlenghi threw a complete bag that spent the entire movie crying about his younger brother being eaten by DinoCroc. But the special effects on "DinoCroc" were better, the plot lines were better and the acting was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. is shipwrecked on a deserted island where they meet an angry group of Filipino natives who try to force the women in the group. That was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough crunch time. There are a couple of redeeming qualities of "Blood Surf" - the actresses are very attractive and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by the croc at the end of the film. But if you're on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch a crocodile movie Matt Borlenghi / Killer, skip this and start the "DinoCroc."
