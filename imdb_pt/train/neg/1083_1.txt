This movie is like real life, so I mean - not much happens in the available 2 hours or so, and there is not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the cast often invisible (its invisibility is due to the "experimental" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> A big hassle. No big surprise that Altman eliminates this - he's a very variable artist (yes, we all love "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" anyone? Kansas City? Dr. T. and the Women? Aaargh), but the fact that Raw is a tale of John Grisham, and the excellent cast you will perceive through meeting your insistent sleep - makes this a true masterpiece of a bad movie. And no, it's not "so bad it's good". <br /> <br /> It's bad.
