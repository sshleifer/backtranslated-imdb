From the opening scene, you'll realize how much they've tried to emulate the very clever and powerful "Cruel Intentions" and how flat it has come. You'll also notice the awful choice they made in choosing Robin Dunne as Valmont ... So in the second scene, you know the two best things in this movie, Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers, like Kathryn and her mother. That is, if you manage to overcome the fact that Kathryn was not blonde in the first film ... So the film goes on, you see the cheap romantic story of miles ago, and you realize that Sebastian has met an Anette in the past, here called Danielle, and a Cecile, here called Cherie ... Like it's original for a prequel. It then transforms into a kind of low budget movie 'Wild Things' with many, many 'my' twists. As I mentioned, Robin Dunne was a lousy choice. Not that he's a bad actor, he's good ... He just does not have the charisma that Ryan did. Amy Adams, who in my opinion is one of the most talented young actresses of our time, once again delivers. But with all the talent in the world, there is no way to save this garbage. As a whole, this "movie" looks like an episode of "Beverly Hills, 90210". The score was stolen from 'Cruel Intentions' and 'Jawbreaker' ... Yes, they used the JAWBREAKER score ... Could not they at least leave it alone?! You will want to go through it. If you want more Cruel Intentions, watch the dangerous contacts of Stephen Frears.
