Besides all the technical mistakes ... How about a stewardess who is capable of killing alone of the 7 terrorists (including ex-Marines), 2 of them without even using a weapon. Then she landed the plane perfectly. We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we're talking about a regular, frightened but very well composed steward. : D How about the leader in command of the assault / rescue squad, having a complete proof (according to the logic of the script) of the plan to sleep with gas to all and to have someone of its team piloting the airplane. He alone decides in the momentum to change plans and, instead, lead an attack on terrorists, weapons in hand, not knowing where the terrorists are, or how many, and not guaranteeing a position of advantage, so that all his team is easily erased. Yes, this is using the old noggin. Only later decide to use sleep gas anyway. And ends up being useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> Worse than this movie was, I could not stop myself from watching and asking myself, what next? : D I can not help but imagine all the excellent unemployed writers thinking about themselves, it's not fair. I laughed a lot! : D
