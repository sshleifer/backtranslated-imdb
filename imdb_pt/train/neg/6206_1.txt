Thomas Clay has mingled with the wrong types. That is the problem with young people these days, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action on the main body of the film is slow and rather boring and goes against the crazed drug as if, as the director, had nowhere to go. We are introduced to the main title character who is a little strange, we see him at school and at home, not fitting well, feeling strange in himself, as many teenagers do. Robert falls in love with bad boys and starts missing school and taking drugs, and before you know it, he's a psychopath. <br /> <br /> The film is about Clay's complete failure to understand the links between images of violence and violent acts. . Clay seems to think that a generation of crazed young people are wicked by war scenes on our TVs. however, he filmed the most disgusting part of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy real? <br /> <br /> If Clay has not yet seen YouTube, maybe he's naive and does not know what will be done with the brutal climax scene of his film? All that anyone is going to want to see is the most horrific scene at the end of the movie and I'm sure it will be the one that will stay with the people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is useless for committing such an act of violence to filming Clay not only curses young people who are actively involved in preventing war, he also condemns himself as perpetrator of extreme and tasteless violence. for no reason better than his own personal celebrity status. <br /> <br /> What a shame for all involved.
