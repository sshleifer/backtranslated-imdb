Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the Cylon origin story. The premise of the show is interesting. However, the writers follow so many story lines and clog up with many POV characters that mess up the narrative. The plot drags on glacial speeds dissipating the tension it might have had. In any episode, little or nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is driven by the AI ​​version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing by soldiers of One (STO), an underground monotheistic extremist group. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (the father of Commander Adama of Battlestar Galactica) is struggling to keep his family together while looking for the AI ​​version of his daughter (who also died in the bombing) in a virtual Machiavellian version of Caprica (which resembles the 1930s Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to the insipid writing, Caprica suffers from a problem similar to many stories of origin. We already know how it ends (ie the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
