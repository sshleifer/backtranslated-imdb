As much as I enjoy Japanese films, this was not just a movie ... A movie that should have been about rebels and the survival of a real blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a dubious plot. The picture is good, although I have seen much better sword fighting scenes in other Japanese films, the speed cameras and the way they followed the characters did not convince me. The soundtrack is so weak that you do not even notice it. But worst of all was how the story evolved. I have to admit that at times I had difficulty understanding who was who and what was happening. ... Anyway, the platonic love between the main character and another was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for a Japanese action movie, are not you? . It's very slow, with very few swordplay scenes and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
