It's hard to criticize this movie, because I do not like the story itself, and no good acting would have saved the story. Think of "Arizona Raising" with a mean streak. The acting is acceptable, but Jennifer Tilly is way above expectations (though not enough to make this movie a good camp), as usual, getting somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic traffic officer. The rest of the cast has their eyebrows perpetually knitted in consternation, either by the stress of their parts or by the stress of all futile exercise. A real degradation of a few hours of film. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying a lot to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it ended, but I left, sorry.
