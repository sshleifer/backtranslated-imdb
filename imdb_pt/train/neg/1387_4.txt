It's hard to believe that a Jet Li movie filled with "action" could be so annoying, but that was transcendental rubbish. The plot is an amalgam of other chopsocky films from Hong Kong. The action of martial arts is all special effects and no human talent. <br /> <br /> It's a comic about a group of superhuman soldiers who must be killed for being mentally unstable, one of them (Li) who holds an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a librarian pacifist. Saved assassins reappear with a quality plot of Austin Powers to rule the world, and Li launches his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was dubbed, and this may have accentuated the tackiness of the fine plot and the special effects of 25 cents. But I suspect that even 8-year-olds who watch Ninja Turtles would have found it so juvenile and empty.
