Going into this movie you know that this is a movie that has six lab technicians in a lab sealed with an invisible maniac. Then you are immediately guessing who will live and who will die. The survivors end up being exactly who you expect them to be, so there are no points to turnarounds there. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if this is a B movie or a film that just happens in a laboratory with an engaging storyline, William Devane plays a role: instant movie status B. <br /> <br /> The movie is promising in the beginning. In the laboratory, we are introduced to the invisible gorilla that is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, foreboding. The best scene in the entire movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Excellent special effects. Same thing when they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are a pair of bare breasts, a dirty dirty joke and enough out of place, vowing to give this movie a R-note that it really did not need. For a thriller, there were no surprises except when Shue does as MacGyver in the freezer, which is more a 'Whaaaa'. Okay, there's a surprise. That's when Caine (Bacon) comes back one last time in the elevator shaft. It was a surprise, but only because you're screaming on TV: 'Nooo! You are already dead! Finish the movie! Speaking of screaming at the TV, that's all I've done in the last 25 minutes. 'Put on your goggles!' Instead of putting their infrared glasses on so they can see it, they try all the other tricks of the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> The story really lost in the end. But the special effects were good; That's the only reason I give 2/10.
