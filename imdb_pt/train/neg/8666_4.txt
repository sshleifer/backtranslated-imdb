This TV thriller is all talk, little action. He works hard to put together his complicated plot, but the writing is so confusing that the exposure is still blurred at best. In the end, I did not know more about these characters than at the beginning. It has almost a scene of "Ten Little Indians," but he abandoned it halfway in favor of highlighting Sally Field and his discovery of a killer. Field overacts here with a lack of grace that I've rarely seen from her. The first few presentations are good, but writing quickly deviates from the course and eventually goes over. Lots of hysteria and constant effects of thunder and lightning (nothing adds up). A curious failure of producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. With all that talent, could not they give us more than a script full of red herrings and Sally Field hiding in a closet?
