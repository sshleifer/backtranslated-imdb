The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that there was Erika Eleniak. She is sexy as ever, but she plays second violin for the lead Wolf Larson. It's a shame because she has more ability to act than she can show here. The film consists of numerous shootings that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you are seeing the bandits armed with machine guns constantly losing Larson and he armed only with a revolver (which NEVER runs out of bullets) taking them all away quite easily. The effects of the earthquake are decent, but there is also much blurry movement and bad CGI blasts. As the psychotic "spiritual leader" Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious pomp that he has to let go of is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming he has some), the finalists may want to take a look at this, for others, it's hardly worth renting. (* 1/2)
