The former private security bodyguard gets rid of his latest job and is immediately given the chance to return to his previous profession. His task: to chase after a mysterious French woman just arrived in California ... and apparently sought out by cheaters in suits and ties. Unsuccessful attempt to update the movie's noir genre, without sufficient sting or intelligence (or involving plot dynamics) in the script. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed that the photo was edited without his involvement) does not seem to take great account of the 1940s films from which his "Chandler" was born; his nostalgia is properly crumpled, but also bitter and a little indifferent. The manipulation is curiously, laudingly discreet, and Warren Oates is well-released as that variant of the '70s in the' private cock 'archetype, but the movie has no pop. It's good to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the squad - though none have much to do, and Caron's hot and cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, good location but not boiling. * 1/2 of ****
