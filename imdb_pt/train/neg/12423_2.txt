Cage (1989) was another of those low-budget "buddy" action films that were produced during the 1980s largely thanks to films such as 48hrs. and lethal weapon. This is starring Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as former Vietnam veterans who happen to run a local dive bar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was shot in the head and is now very soft. Although he is huge, Lou has the brain of a child. One day, some ruffians threw their hold at the bar and Lou and Rebb hit their tar. But the return is a mother. They hit the bar leaving Lou and Reb with nothing. That's until those two bad guys step in (one of them's really a cool guy) who has a plan in mind. <br /> <br /> The movie is a waste of time. Maybe if they did well and made a radical action movie instead of trying to ease the awful situation, maybe it could have worked. Unfortunately, this does not happen and the audience keeps holding the bag. Oh well. It's too bad because you have all the elements for a great B movie. Better luck next time, I guess. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. xxx
