This movie had potential and I was willing to give it a try, but there are so many issues on the timeline that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow being treated like an idiot. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set in the mid-seventies. For this film to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not in the late 1940s. Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Roland that Carlito supposedly ran on his "Hey Day". None of the main characters in the original movie were in this movie. We should believe Carlito knew all these people in the space of a few years. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking down the beach talking about retiring in paradise, which is what he wanted to do in the original movie. In addition, the prequel creates the characters Rocco and Earl - what should happen to them, since they are clearly not on Carlito's Way? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he had in the original film, attending the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two films and he spends five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug in a round hole. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making money by making an ordinary gangster movie. and playing a character named Carlito Brigante in the story. The movie had some good moments, but I think it would be better to leave this movie to stand alone instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito's Way. <br /> <br /> If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give you is not to think of the movie as a linear prequel. Think of it as the spaghetti westerns with the unnamed Clint Eastwood man, in other words, two movies that have the same character but are not necessarily connected to each other.
