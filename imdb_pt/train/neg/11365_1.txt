This is a very sad movie. Same. Nothing happens in this movie. The script is bad !!! I think they just copy and paste the first 15 pages into 90 pages. The producers must have thought about creating a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now, in the third week, it will only run in Antwerp and Brussels at 10:45 or something. In the past, we had good films in Belgium, like Daens. Shades is a waste of your time. Maybe you could go to the movies after seeing a real movie. If you've seen 10 minutes of Shades, you've seen it all. It was announced to death on radio and on local TV. I hope it disappears in the Shadows soon.
