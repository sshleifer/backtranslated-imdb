I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes started "taking care" of the plane. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought it might take a "one" for comic relief. But then I realized I could just watch the three goofies for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Whatever respect I may have for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood demonstrates yet again how it is removed from the reality that they really are. When I was a kid we used to get snakes for fun. The only thing the snakes would do is pile up at the bottom of the cargo bay. And no amount of Hollywood snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth a trip to Blockbuster. Be warned: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your idiot. <br /> <br /> If you want to be very afraid, I suggest the Descent. If you want humor, go to your local comedy club. Your worst performance will be a million times better than this crap.
