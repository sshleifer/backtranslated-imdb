Like many media experiments, this amateur endeavor contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the more than 5 years since it was released, the premise has become less scandalous by real-world events in software development, and I found it less annoying than the previous commentator for that reason, I imagine ... The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it's a pity that the film has not performed better, but in fact it's almost a parody of fiction, including the soundtrack screaming at us when we should pay attention. We can almost see the exclamation points and uppercase letters on a yellowish page. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I found it interesting for all these reasons and more. Sometimes the stain has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yeah - and even if the seams showed and they creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
