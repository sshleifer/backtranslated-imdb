The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest movies of the 90's. The second was so funny with the same cast and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious as to how they could continue with the same story, considering that Kevin was 17 years old in 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So, what does the director decide to do? He takes such an irritating child and makes him sick. The boy is about 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of hamburger team are these idiots? I really do not want to go into detail if you want to see this movie. But please, I recommend you stay away from this. Not worth your precious time. Go folding a piece of paper, doing chores, balancing a pencil on the nose, or taking a nap! It's best to watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> 1/10
