First of all, I would like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere in this movie. What a movie without Sam Niel. Has anyone seen the Event Horizon? D-Wars has the potential for a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers that sounds cool, but unfortunately it's not. No, not Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend grabbing the $ 5 or more that is required to rent D-Wars and add 10 to five and buy a Sam Niel movie - apparently to send this I have to have ten lines of text, so here is a list of movies from Sam Niel I recommend <br /> <br /> -Jurassic park -dead calm -course for October red -event horizon -not jurassic park three <br /> <br /> general D-Wars is a pile
