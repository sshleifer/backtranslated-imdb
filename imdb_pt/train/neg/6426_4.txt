I found the documentary titled Fast, Cheap and Out of Control a rather interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries about four interesting men. Each of these men was extremely involved in his work, showing pure love and pleasure for his work. <br /> <br /> The sad part, I must say, would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked / studied. . They became interesting for about five minutes, then becoming boring and enduring for a long time. <br /> <br /> The video was filmed in a very creative way. I really liked the movie of one thing with one voice instead of another. He played great and also coincided well with the song.
