I wasted my time and gave this show a chance. This has to be one of the worst shows ever. If they gave a prize to shows that suck this should sweep the category. The acting is poor and the plot is planned. Now the dinosaurs were a little strange, but at least it was fun. This show lasted three seasons and was finally shaved. This new show, based on commercials from an insurance company, is not funny and really has nothing to do with it. Possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were, and still are, repeated is what's wrong with this show. It has just hit the TV and we are tired of seeing the characters "caveman".
