I do not want to come out in a rush here, but ..... this is the worst "movie" I've ever seen. Worse than the Avengers. Incompetent leadership, disjointed writing and horrible acting are the only consistent elements. Filmed in a very cheap video, it looks like a high school project but without the thrill. The lighting often looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is a bit better than a single microphone on the camera, but everything else about this thing is awful. The plot goes in strange directions, with no foundation or subsequent resolution, the technical elements are clearly absurd, and the editing seems worse than a crude cut. Not bad enough to be funny. Is bad. BTW, packaging is intentionally misleading. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate owes me $ 4.00.
