I think I've seen worse movies, so I'm giving a 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they could have been !! Possibly Xtro (nasty and dull) or possibly Creep (simply dull), but it's a struggle to think of something worse. It's hard to know where to start. Let's just say it's an Under Siege from a poor man, starring Jean Claude Van Damme from an even poorer man. The only redeeming feature was to see Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rich, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging from this site, he's stuck in the TV movie, hell ... Casper, be more selective ... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just turned around and there's a decent movie called Criminal Law ...... Now I'm starting to get really resentful with the last 1.5hrs !!!
