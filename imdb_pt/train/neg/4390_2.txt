The TV guide described the plot of SEPARATE RECORDS so: "An experiment on a severed arm goes wrong," then immediately thought it would be an arm that has a mind of its own, as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or THE HAND or someone receiving an arm transplant as in BODY PARTS. Both of these assumptions are tried and tested, or, to be more precise, tired and tested, I was curious to know how the producers would approach the story. I actually thought they were making an art film like PI up to the use of black and white photography at the beginning of the movie, but the manufacturers seemed to tire of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to make a comedy similar to THE EVIL DEAD. I have very little to say about it except that I did not like THE EVIL DEAD movies and I did not like to RECORD SERIOUS and it seems really unfair that movies like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world is crying out for condoms
