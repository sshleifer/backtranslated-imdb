This movie is not as interesting except for the first ten minutes. Rhythm and editing is a perfect introduction to a set piece, even better than Gosford Park. Then inexplicably slows down, loses focus and begins to resemble a traditional French film only to regain focus at the end with the love relationship between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In between, there are many secondary lines and loose ends in history, several topics started are not finalized. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS Ahead The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cécile. He has been loyal to her after her relationship with her many years ago despite having remarried and settled down in Morocco. As a builder, he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers, taking the mask of Cecile's marriage. Having achieved this, he is buried after a strange accident (literally) and becomes comatose. He wakes up only after she has burned her old image as an indication that they have reconciled with the past and can begin their lives together again. ******* END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The vision that this director wants to see us remains uncertain, because there are so many other stories here: illegal immigrants want to enter Europe, there are frequent radio broadcasts about overthrow of the former Iraqi regime. Cécile's son is bisexual and bitten by dogs (loyalty) when he meets his boyfriend, while the girl with whom he lives seems to be sick (this?). Her sister is a traditional Islamic and comes into contact with Cécile's husband. It portrays Morocco as unnecessary behind, despite the whole building there is a strange gleaming colonial vision that almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as backward and prone to extremism, which sometimes may be true, but certainly not in general. In the end, everything can be better described as adding some locale and l'art pour l'art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material they are so familiar that they are able to do something extra in each scene: raise an eyebrow, body language, radiant pride, clumsy behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of French cinema in the world nowadays. With some notable exceptions, of course.
