As 'First Blood', this attempt to make a point about the treatment of Vietnam veterans, but not long ago to this between monotonous shots, burns, stabbings, tortures and explosions as an impossibly indestructible Rambo takes half of Asia, a ton of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, several vehicles and anything else he can point to a rocket launcher. The only woman in the middle of all these boys' toys is soon discarded, allowing testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script degenerates into a succession of loud noises. Joyfully supplying some banal musical tracks, Jerry Goldsmith, who carefully selects all the clich√©s themes from Russian rat-a-tat to Chinese ching-chang-chong, in case we do not quite understand who we are looking at. Stallone has a brain in his head; this empty absurdity is beneath him.
