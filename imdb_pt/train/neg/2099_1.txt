PLEASE NOTE: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you should mind. Also, sorry for the caps.) Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that is much more annoying to talk nonsense, this continues with unnecessary nonsense and dramas . . That's bad, but accurate. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky venture. There is a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunction, radiation, stress related symptoms, etc., and unexpected things are about to happen in widely unknown environments. They knew things could go wrong. In fact, things went awry. This is called learning. Granted, Appollo 11 was not safe by today's standards and there was immense political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology in the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Mistakes / comments I did not even have to look up: 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something goes wrong. Well, duh. That's what I would have done. It was the height of a propaganda war, after all. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably explode. (That's "only" implicit, though.) Yes, that's why they leave people and press the clock almost in real time. <br /> <br /> 3) Ejection of the capsule would not work. As if it did not work the time a chimp was in it. The one who survived? It was a launch test and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with a parachute. There is a video of it, you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) One guy interviewed said an explosion would have destroyed a fair share of Florida. I can only assume it was designed as a hyperbole, because if not, I'm just horrified how it could make it so wrong. <br /> <br /> 5) Technology was primitive compared to today's standards. In fact, relatively primitive software and hardware are used until today, the reason is that it should not fail. It is even worse for spacecraft because their computers must be constructed of comparatively large components that are not susceptible to radiation. (And the vehicle itself should be piloted manually anyway, so a complex steering system like B2's would not work.) What's with the fact that they were using "TV screens" rather than "screens" computer"? It's the same damn technology. In fact, TV monitors have been and are produced with a significantly higher definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this object were not part of the rocket, it could be only one thing." We see where this is going. Besides the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it was not a part of the rocket? At least one respondent clarifies that if a thing is flying and you do not know what it is, it is, by definition, an Unidentified Flying Object. <br /> <br /> 7) The voice-over, as well as some erroneous quotes, make it seem that the Lander's radiation sheet was actually his helmet. Which would make it thinner than a spacesuit. <br /> <br /> 8) Neil Armstrong's near death during a training flight is a shoot that I can appreciate; I had not seen this before. As I said, any piece of overt technology can go wrong, especially if it has not been tested enough because it is, you know, unprecedented. <br /> <br /> (9) The descending lander's discrepancy (due to irregularities in the Moon's density) was not at all acutely fatal. Not even the "fifteen seconds of fuel left," which was, in fact, "fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and return to the command module." <br /> <br /> 10) A "catastrophic chain of events" often results in catastrophe. I really do not know how to simplify. This, however, is an excellent example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> 11) There is a small sequence of one of the astronauts walking and jumping aimlessly like a merry kid, followed by the narration telling us that the reason for this strange behavior "can now be revealed." Turns out he was walking and jumping aimlessly like a gay boy. Hilarious things. <br /> <br /> 12) It is mentioned that during re-entry, all contact was lost. This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and was as well known at the time as it is impossible to get around contemporary technology. Again, the gravity of this is implicit, but very purposely. <br /> <br /> 13) There has never been a bus lost in space itself, while voice-over presents this "fact" as evidence that Appollo 11 was a heap of crap. Appollo 13 was almost lost, but the two real disasters occurred during takeoff and re-entry, respectively. Anyway, comparing space shuttle with Saturn rockets is somehow ... well, ok, just stupid. While ignoring this, successful missions appear to have been considered of no interest to the public. <br /> <br /> 14) What the heck is going on with the UFO? Even in the context of the film, it does not make sense. Unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes, intended for a specific audience (which seems to include people with almost no understanding of history, science or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the point of the film is a bit obscure. Phrases such as "obscured so far," "publicly revealed here for the first time," appear, but the film puts no blame or offers a lesson or anything, what could be expected of such an emotionally made film. In the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are innumerable shots of interviews and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people we do not know except "NASA scientist." Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the effort? Like that. What does this have to do with the movie spot again? Oh yeah, what point. <br /> <br /> In short, besides being intentional or incompetently inaccurate, it's not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who likes his bad documentaries; this movie is not funny, witty, picturesque, it's nothing.
