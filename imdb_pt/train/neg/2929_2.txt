Is not it funny - how can anyone link this to Monty Python? This is absolutely ridiculous - there are no laughs. This is not funny. On top of it, but ugly, strange just because of strange stuff and it seems to me that these people were on something all the time. Unfortunately something that did not make them funny. <br /> <br /> You should give some points for the effort etc. In fact, it looks like there's a clue to laughter - or is there one? Hmmm .... Since there are almost no laughs that is a debatable issue. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing injustice - maybe it's some kind of exercise. Some kind of art - in that case, anything is worth it, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> But these guys play women with high voices, nose upset. Let's go !!! It's not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one apparent heir to the intellectual intelligence of Monty Pythons, who is Stephen Colbert, and perhaps Jon Stewart.
