This seemed like a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the film I was hoping it would be a significant use of my time, and yes, I have to admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval , where really commendable, but despite the best effort this film does not effectively convey a meaningful message, it seems that's what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The end point is short and the end seems a bit unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like real life in this respect, but the movies, unlike real life, end in about 2 hours and the end should leave the audience satisfied, if that was the intention of the director. This is insufficient in this respect and this is what disappoints me most. Another aspect that worried me was the national stereotyping of the American characters - they all seem to have been carved in the same block. . It seems to me that most of the American characters in Indian English films are based on how the Indians themselves perceive the Americans to be and of course no effort was made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the film. /> <br /> These two aspects together form a disappointing story.
