Let's first start this review with the fact that I just signed to write the review and warn people to save their money! <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst pieces of crap I've seen since the Hulk. The plot was the most predictable garbage you could ever invent. If you are waiting 24 but on the big screen, wash that expectation by the bathroom immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket. You can get more pleasure this way. The acting was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic, (along with the so-called "twist" at the end.I must say this .. The ending surprised me.I am not referring to the turnaround in the story that surprised me, but rather the way without effort they set up which could be considered the only decent action scene in the whole movie They ran the end so quickly that I did not even realize it was over until I saw the credits rolling and at that moment I considered burning the roll of <br /> <br /> Casting was horrible for a few reasons.First of all, they must have accidentally changed the character's assignments, Michael Douglas played the role that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should be playing While Douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping phone lines, invading systems and taking out people who are chasing him, Sutherland interpret to the less capable agent who is always in ab good mood even when things are not going so badly for him. He plays a very mild agent, nothing like his kind of Jack Bauer in the 24 fans love rolls. <br /> <br /> I can promise that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It may be better compared to a remake of "The Fugitive" / "In the Line of Fire," but written by people with mental disabilities
