Dude, what a scam this turned out to be! Not because it was not good (since I was not really expecting any of this), but because I was fooled by the cover of the DVD, which ignorantly paraded its "stars" as being Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. For sure, their names did not appear in the opening credits of the movie, much less the rest! As it turned out, the only movie that connects these three actors together is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975) ?? but what does this have to do with CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anyone? <br /> <br /> Even so, since I paid $ 1.50 for the rent and I was in a monster movie mood anyway, I decided to watch the movie anyway and, yes, it's horrible ! In addition to the fact that I had an unnamed cast and an anonymous team, an unmistakably amateur air was visible from miles away and the most I could do was laugh at JAWS 'intentions and, intentionally, the resilient. the antics of two imbecile bosses - boat owners who often fight each other with the neat local sheriff watching. The creature itself? a plesiosaur, that is, half dinosaur / half fish ?? is imperfectly realized (of course) but, as was the case with THE GIANT CLAW (1957), which I have just seen, this did not bother the filmmakers, as they show it as much as they can, especially during the second half of the film!
