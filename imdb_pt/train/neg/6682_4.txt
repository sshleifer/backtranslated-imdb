This comedy is not really funny. It's a novel that touches so much on stereotypes that it does not make an impact. It's such a derivative caper film - yes, even at that time - it does not pop. <br /> <br /> The cast is adequate. More than that, it's hard to say. However, what is good is that players are not familiar. At MGM, that would have starred Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman, with no time for anything but work, could have been any number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We may be grateful for this little-known film being populated by artists unknown to this day. And the production values ​​are not terrible. Still does not make any real impression. <br /> <br /> It's a generic copy. And who wants it?
