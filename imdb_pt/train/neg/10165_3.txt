San Francisco is a big city with great acting credits. In this, the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city. They did not even get the most basic of realistic details. So I would not recommend it to anyone based on being a San Francisco movie. You will not be thinking "oh, I've been there," you'll be thinking "how a double-decker / stinking armpit turned into a quiet hotel lobby?" Some of the leaders used East Coast's speech and affection styles. That diminishes, but the acting has always been competent. <br /> <br /> Stories seemed to be filmed in three distinct styles, at least in the beginning. The history of Chinatown was the most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, ripped scene to scene of Hong Kong class action movies. The originals had much more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and rhythmically better. But the acting is fun and we get to see James Hong and other luminaries. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the white boy was useless. I think the filmmakers did not know what to do with it, so they left it structured freely and cut it off. The father is a strange attempt by a Berkeley liberal - really, personally, everyone knows it's not "cool" to live in the ghetto - but their segments are the funniest. They threw away some good opportunities. Educated and embittered on the west coast, a yuppie idiot here is a different kind of yuppie idiot than they do in New York. They are equally intolerable, but always distinguishable. That would have been interesting; this was not. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Hunter's Point was the most disappointing. It was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the furthest from San Francisco. You've seen this before and saw better. Even the video game was better! <br /> <br /> Despite the generic non-locality and aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting begins to force their way in the awkward direction ... about ten minutes before the end . Good concept placed in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.
