Dolph Lundgren stars as a Templar who comes to New York when a key that releases the antichrist is found by an archaeologist, of course the demon is only a few miles away from Dolph and is not killed as easily as he transfers from body to body. body. body. (Like Fallen without the suspense) Of course Lundgren is out of his element and the film is completely unattainable. I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch their movies whenever they are on TV. I picked up Minion and boy I was disappointed. This movie is absolutely terrible. With poorly staged and poorly edited action sequences, you can barely make coherent sense in the arena of fighting. Worst of all is the unconvincing performance of Lundgren as a tough priest (!) All this worsened that the film is so a steal from Fallen (which was good) and End Of Days (which was bad, but better than that) This movie is the worst movie I've seen of Dolph Lundgren. Literally has nothing to recommend it. It's awful and it's the low point of Lundgren's career. And I saw Cover-Up, The Last Warrior and Masters Of The Universe. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * Out Of 4- (Awful)
