Wow and I thought any Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought the movie could not get any worse, I was wrong. The story was good, but the actors did not succeed. In addition, they have made many mistakes in how proper archaeological excavations are done. For example, you do not manipulate artifacts until they are cataloged and accounted for. The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the film less realistic than it already was. The whole concept of knights' templars being underground all these years seemed very stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and things like that, so it almost looked depressing. I thought the characters were not well explained. You did not find out too deep and it made it more difficult to relate to them.
