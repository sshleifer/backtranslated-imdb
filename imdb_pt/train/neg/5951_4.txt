Written by the excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this film was a small disappointment. It seemed very short. He spent a lot of time creating the Hovis atmosphere and laughing at Catholic demands. So, very quickly, you have the fascists and the socialists vying for the family's attention, and the terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> Still my wife thought Liam was cute.
