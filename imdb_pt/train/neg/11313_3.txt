and it does not help Rohmer's case that, a few years later, Syberberg appeared and did an incredibly great job on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie did not happen. It seems so insignificant when it came out, without the syberberg movie to compare, which was probably filmed in an even smaller sound stage with fewer features. I do not really remember at the moment if there are horses in the syberberg movie. all I know is that the German version is pure magic, while this looks like a university production documented on film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> music ... la musique ... nor is it credited here in IMDb ... but someone was based on "ares from the XII-XIV centuries" or something ... well, no is a great help for the movie. He seems inauthentic and tacky, as in Le Ma !!! Rohmer is one of those French authors who also likes its protagonists, but also does not help much, since Parsifal, of Syberberg, was adorable and can be seen in German television today. selling some kind of special bike he invented ... <br /> <br /> I shudder to think about what it's like to see syberberg in the video. I remember the last time I saw the movie in a theater, the impression was so bad that the experience was a huge 5 hour farce, but even then I would have to overcome what this version has to offer, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Points for seriousness, for daring, but ... this movie simply needed more money. it does not look like a medieval manuscript, it seems CHEAP! BON MARCHE !! oh, and yes, that ends up in a very arbitrary way with Parsifal going to church and that tacky passion being interposed ... blah!
