I liked Batman: Dead End. A dark-noir scenario of Batman was perfect. Batman: Dead End is good. That is not. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start with acting. None of this is so good. The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman. But that's not saying much. He is good at first sight, and then you realize that he is what he is, a body builder who happens to be a tolerable actor. But mostly the problem is that Batman does not belong in the light of day, he looks like a freak running in a bat suit. Instead of a man with horrible scars trying to make up for the mistakes of the past. The light of day also reveals an annoying grimace on Bartram's face, which never comes out and can not be noticeable in Batman: Dead End, probably because of the darkness of the short that is so desired in this trailer. Bartram seems to think that frowning and stubbornly shaking his head is acting, is not it, is just the opposite. It's called posing, something real actors avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood because Collora escalated bodybuilders as leaders. It makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it, rather than a bodybuilder who can control it, but HE LOOKS LIKE COMIC! Of course, they could have done better if the Dialogue of Collora had not left much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The entire trailer (yes, trailer. There will not be a full-length movie) is more focused on Superman then Batman. But everything on Superman's side is tacky, naughty and amateurish. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He stands around, smiles, says his lines. That's about it. Although I am not surprised, since he is just a bodybuilder, they hired and possibly received some acting lessons. Again I say to Collora, cast ACTORS. Not bodybuilders. The actors will be much more convincing than we will forgive the fact that they do not look exactly like the comic book. <br /> <br /> The costume is what you would expect Superman to wear. As for the Batman suit. Well, I guess it only looks good in the dark. I say this because in some scenes, the costume looks like something you would buy at a Halloween gift shop. <br /> <br /> Superman flies in this movie. But this is not good. These photos look especially amateurish. This and much of the entire "movie" looks like it was filmed in your backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best shots are a shot of Superman catching a car in his hands. And the final shot of Two-Face and Batman at the end. For those of you who have seen the trailer. You know what I'm talking about. Now, if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer. <br /> <br /> Finally I ask. Why, if you're trying to show off your ability as a director, would you make a trailer as a short film? This does not prove anything when it comes to being a real director. My only advice to Collora here is that there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and to be able to work in marketing. <br /> <br /> Batman: Dead End did not feel amateur. I can not figure out where this went wrong.
