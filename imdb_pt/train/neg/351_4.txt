1st seen 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with lots of ridiculous twists. Despite the very talented cast, this film is very predictable and just underestimates the audience. The moviegoers are not stupid and I hope they do not continue to fill certain pockets of stars again and again despite what they are involved with. We think this movie will be about something with Connery's conviction against the Capitol's punishment at the beginning, but ends up being nothing more than a pattern, planned for the good of the audience, on the side of the mill, we will never end it, suspense . We are drawn to every foolish change of character as they are pictured to us when they are needed in history, and we are ready for that to happen before it is over. Yes, there is something good here, especially Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris, in a psychological support role, but the story does not work from the beginning until the long awaited end.
