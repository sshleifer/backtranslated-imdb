I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986 was universally criticized by critics, and I'm talking so badly it ended more or less with Eddie Murphy's brilliant career, so I think this movie has something to do with it. /> <br /> It starts badly, where Buddhist monks kneel in front of a child with an empty expression on their face. Bad men enter the temple <br /> <br /> The child sits with empty expression <br /> <br /> The bad guys enter the monks <br /> <br /> The child sits with empty expression <br /> <The bad guys take the giant cage and stick the child inside who is now sitting ... Go guess? You get the impression that even if they took you to a party at Michael Jackson's Wonderland Ranch, he would still give you the same blank expression, that movie would be better titled THE WOOD CHILD <br /> <br /> begins the sequence of the title and being a 1980s film, a pop soundtrack stands out a lot. Obviously, this may have been cool and funky at the time, but now in 2004 it seems very outdated. Not only that, but completely open with the somewhat bloody opening. In fact, that's the main problem (and boy, really) with this movie - the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much that sometimes it's like watching scenes from totally different films together. I personally blame the director, but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and the producer must share the same guilt. Did anyone know before filming started what kind of movie this was going to be? It's part fantasy, part martial arts, part friends movie, part comedy and it's all crap
