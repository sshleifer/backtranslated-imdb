I've tried watching this movie three different times. At night I rented it. I got about 20 minutes hoping it would be best if I had a night's rest. I watched 15 more the next day, I almost threw up with how stupid it was ... It was not even funny the stupid one that sometimes is a fun movie to watch, but this movie was crap with a capital S (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the stupid thing and did not take a moment! Not even one. How was this script made clear? Oh boy! G / 1/10 - the only one is for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their hard work.
