Bill Maher's Religion is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a bunch of rabbis inventing deformed machines to circumvent Saturday's regulations, he does not really attack Judaism and seems furious when a rabbi really challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that Israel's very creation in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so-called "sacred books" of organized religion. This is evidence of their total and absolute lack of objectivity or focus on the making of this film. <br /> <br /> I find it very difficult to believe that man is atheist or even so intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what do you have to offer in return? Nowhere does he really tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him the "rational" person in the room? In a way, it reflects how he really is not and in the process ends up looking as stupid as these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good movie / documentary about the true evils of religion and how religion can actually be harmful to human civilization, see Richard's "Root of All Evil" Dawkins? It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Bill Maher's religion is not funny, does not present interesting questions or provide any insight into such a controversial subject. It seems to be the complaints and delusions of an old man dissatisfied with his Catholic education. I almost feel sorry for him.
