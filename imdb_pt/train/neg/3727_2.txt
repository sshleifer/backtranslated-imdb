Written and interpreted by sincere amateurs, produced by some explorer explorer, this is monotonous and difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie ever, but at least one slash like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" usually had a real actor. or two. I would recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only for hardcore ironies and hardcore dispensers. I'm not even. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me?
