Sorry - this movie is just an inexpensive TV production. I've seen a lot of promotion material and expect a professional movie like "Stormriders" - what I was introduced to was a low budget film like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. At Atmosphere, very annoying, more than worse Fight-Scenes. Some good ideas - no more. I hope I get the chance to make a movie like this and then show you how to make a movie like that !!! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN tips: "MUSE - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "REAL BATTLE", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my lousy English!
