I can not vote for it because I would not see these people junk. They took my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore it would never happen again. I feel it's my civic duty to help people get away from this garbage. Go to the forums of this movie and read where the cast members try to act as if they were watching the movie for the first time. A guy answers himself ... using the same name! There are shills in the forum that say it's as good as Shadeshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close at all. If this is the second film of the company, it should be better than the first. This means that the third film should be much better. Not so, I've seen it. All I want to know is how you distribute this garbage using the same names all the time. Having fun with friends and making a movie over the weekend is good ... but do not try to market this crap!
