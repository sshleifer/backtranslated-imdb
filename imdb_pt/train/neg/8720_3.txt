Put aside a Dr. House repeat that I had missed, and an Desperate Housewives (new) to watch this. I do not know exactly what plagued this movie. I never thought I'd say that, but I want my 15 minutes of fame back. <br /> <br /> Script, Direction, I can not say. I recognized the stable of actors (the usual suspects), but I thought Herbert Marshall was a class addition and sat me down for a good cheese movie. Boy, was I wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: where the "office girl" does with the 029 keypunch and puts the cards in a 087 classifier. LOL @ "the computer". Would you like someone to identify the next device - a 477? It's even before the time of this dinosaur. <br /> <br /> And we, dinosaurs, do not have much time to waste.
