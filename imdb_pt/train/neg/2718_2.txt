This is the least scary movie I've ever seen. How the bubble manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the movie. The bubble moves so slowly that an o.a.p. in a zimmerframe can escape it. The bubble is fortunate enough to find a typical horror movie woman who, instead of running away, stands for half an hour to be able to be eaten. If you have not seen this movie yet, I recommend you do it, it's too funny to be taken seriously.
