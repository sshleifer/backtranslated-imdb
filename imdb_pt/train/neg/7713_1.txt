I knew this movie should be so bad that it was funny, so I came in with that expectation. I just thought it was so bad it was deadly boring. The theme song is fun for about 10 seconds, until you realize there's nothing smart about it except your intentionally annoying quality. Seeing things peppered with tomatoes ages in about 30 seconds. There is nothing clever or funny about the movie except for the premise. He could sustain a 3-4 minute comedy sketch, perhaps, but this is not just a movie of any stretch of the imagination.
