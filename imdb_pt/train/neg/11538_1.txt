A really horrible movie that made me very sick for watching the forty minutes or so. It's not the actors' fault, but the writer / director, producers, financiers, etc., need a very hard conversation. Maybe you think it's deep. It is not. This rape and ultra-violence, contrary to what is central to Mechanical Orange, has nothing to say or add to the sum of human understanding. It is no straw dog, to which I have seen compared. On the contrary, it seems something that Pete Walker could have turned his hand on, but even when saying that I'm probably being a bit unfair to Pete Walker. Vengeance is a powerful human desire, but The Bedroom Window has more to say about it and male emasculation than this regrettable effort. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's particularly misogynist, just very cheerful in its description of certain details - blood dripping down GA's leg after rape for example. It is neither challenging nor contentious, although I am sure that the filmmakers consider themselves very "daring," just deeply unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Is it as high as we can point? Is that why those involved wanted to make movies? (I wrote here the Latin phrase that translates as "Oh the Times!" Oh the customs!) But the new speller of the IMDb would not let me post until I had removed. <br /> <br /> Where is the sublime aspiration? The noble impulse? When you look at British cinema - the gay comedies of Ealing or the Boulting brothers; The work of Carol Reed with Graham Greene in Fallen Idol, Our Man in Havana or the sublime The Third Man (a film that has much more to say about evil than a thousand Straightheads); the work of Powell & Pressburger; or if you want to talk about sex, violence and male emasculation, look at "The Offense" Dir. Sidney Lumet, from an original John Hopkins play, check out "Tunes of Glory" for something worth doing, something to do. tell. <br /> <br /> Unlike the previous one, Straightheads is unfortunately a completely obnoxious waste of celluloid.
