It's hard to praise this movie very much. The CGI for the dragon was well done but lacked adequate shaping for light and shadow. In addition, the same footage is used infinitely by the dragon trampling runners, which becomes a bit tedious. <br /> <br /> I was impressed to see "Marcus Aurelius" in the acting credits, imagining what a former Roman emperor The Empire was acting in this movie! As "Whoopie Goldberg" should be a pseudonym, and one can blame him for wearing one if he appears in this stinky one. <br /> <br /> The story may have been interesting, but the acting is flat, and the direction is boring. If you MUST watch this movie, go to your friend's house and get drunk while doing it - then it will be nice.
