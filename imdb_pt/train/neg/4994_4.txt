Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you are not in the mood for it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, without thinking only about action when I watched this. It started off good and it was quite fun, so why a bad review. Well, in the end, the movie lost its credibility. The plot was nothing fancy, the action was not very special, but overall it was good, acting was good, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But everything was ruined because things happened that were at the top, and that left me with a bad feeling. They should have made a little more effort to make everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the category "do not just think about simple actions". So in conclusion if you know you will be annoyed because things are happening that seem completely illogical: do not watch! otherwise I would say go ahead ...
