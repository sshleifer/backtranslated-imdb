Let's see where to start ... bad acting; I'm not sure if I would say this, since it's more like an effortless script. The actors did not even seem to be in their parts and seemed quite lifeless and apathetic. Of course there was a scene or two with nudity, but this could not save this movie from its lifeless characters. <br /> <br /> To call the main character of a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. The letters had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the meaningless lines. <br /> <br /> Budget? This movie had a budget? It seems they used less money than I saw in a homemade YouTube video. Poor lighting, props, poor quality post-production. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. The story might have been good if people really seemed interested in doing it, but there was no life in that movie; I do not care who he drove. <br /> <br /> I saw some really bad movies last year and this is definitely the last. Do not waste your time or you will want to hear this unbiased review. Check the ratings, you'll see that the 1s are quickly surpassing the 10's fluffed with almost nothing between the two. I wish I had looked a little more before I wasted my time. What a suction party!
