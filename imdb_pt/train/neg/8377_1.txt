This is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless. . . because stupid producers pay their money to make horrible movies like this instead of donating if they can bother! <br /> <br /> This movie is even worse than white! Little Man has a ragged excuse to put a dwarf character as a baby. The story is horrible considering it was written by six people. The idea still would not be so bad, if it were original and it was not a coup for a cartoon episode. There are funny moments, but some of them are super-made and some are just plain stupid. The acting was very, very bad. So was the direction. Anyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. is racist and very offensive to dwarfs. I mean, instead of showing sympathy for them, the filmmakers mock them! It really pisses me off how they do it. They see dwarfs being like babies. And for a character who is a dwarf, pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family. That's your excuse to show something like that. It just was not worth it. Do not watch this movie. It is a huge waste of time and money.
