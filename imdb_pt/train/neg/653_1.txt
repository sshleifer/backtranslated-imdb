If I could give this movie a real rating, it would probably be in the negative numbers. Although I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible horror movies, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this movie, is a waste of money that you could spend on something much more valuable. <br /> <br /> Despite being a horror movie, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of ​​seeing how many horror clichés you can put on a movie scares you. If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made a better movie in the long run. <br /> <br /> Who made this version of "Prom Night", you missed. The actors probably could have done a decent job were it not for the questionable script. This was a terrible waste of a movie trip. I'd rather go and see "One Missed Call" again, at least it had some plot.
