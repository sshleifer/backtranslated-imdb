I do not know why, but for some sick reason, I think since I've been on the Disney binge, I've decided to go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first movie that was a remake of the Disney cartoon classic, starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, sounded like a hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason these films do not work is because the 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, just worked better and was more appealing to children as well as to adults. This was not really so much fun because they are adults running around trying to act like cartoons rather than just real humans, I understand they are trying to make sure it is appealing to children but it is ridiculous to see how these actors are doing behaving in the movie. And the story of 102 Dalmations is not so good. Cruella De Vil has been in prison for some time, but things change when she proves that she now loves animals and is a nice human being. But her reputation is now damaged as a dog-napper, but she buys a man's dog shelter and is suddenly being loved by everyone and it seems she has changed. But when she sees the Dalmatians of her probation officer, she goes mad and starts to see points, and she loses it. She is back to get revenge on her puppies and is still determined to get the Dalmation coat she always wanted. Glenn Close is such an incredible actress, very rude, but she's staring at Cruella De Vil, she's good, but let's face it, this movie made the fun villain just crazy. Also, as cute as the puppies were, it just works more for animation, sounds stupid, but it's not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities are in the mix. I really would not recommend 102 Dalmations, that's OK, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, that's the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
