I'm watching this movie now on WTN because this was the channel the TV was on when I called it. It is a not very credible and rather boring story about a minister's wife (Alexandra Paul) falling into lust with a young stallion / bum (with washboard abdomen) played by Corey Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey takes off the shirt a lot and Alexandra faints. I have the feeling that he's supposed to be not well, which is why he's fiddling with the skinny Alexandra Paul. It is not very important because, as I said, he takes his shirt off a lot and I only had a glimpse of the neckline. There's a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is painful.
