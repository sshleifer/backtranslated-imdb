I can not believe this movie got a relatively high rating of 6! It's hardly watchable and incredibly annoying, certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. <br /> <br /> In a non-budgeting way, this reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you're witnessing a total creative train wreck. <br /> <br /> This movie should be avoided at all costs. It's one of those "festival films" that only appeal to pseudo-intellectuals because they're so poorly made that people think it makes it "different," so it's good. <br /> <br /> Bad movies are not "different", it's just a bad movie.
