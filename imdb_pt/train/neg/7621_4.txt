As noted, this formula was filmed several times, most recently as "You've Got Mail" with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Of the various versions, this is my least favorite. I think the problem is that the studio ran aground on Stars' charisma, which does not quite fit here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two ends never boils in this movie. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of one-day donuts, nice, but bland. And when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I do not know if she was having trouble with the pain or something, but she looks like a turtle trying to pull her head into the shell, all bent and all. I could not figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot. I would have made a bee line for that cute violinist. And Van was not great either. I've always thought of him as a pretty generic Hollywood lead man and he does nothing to dispel that image here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the stars or the early 1900s, then you may like this movie. But there are a lot more fun romantic comedies out there, and they offer a lot more than a bit of old-fashioned confection.
