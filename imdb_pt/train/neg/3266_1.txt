When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) ran away with his own brother, he runs to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to unload his story of distress - only to find that Norman has a secret lover: The Effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not get along, and numerous complications ensue - including Ben's attempt to convince Norman to be a homosexual, fixing him with a prostitute (Tammy Dobson). of the film sounds a lot more fun than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for the theater by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... IS YOU? it was an absolute disaster on the New York stage. To give the piece the result, I actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theater production - and although no one accused it of being anything but a shallow farce, the cast played so widely and so dropped. that this was quite amusing. It's a shame that the cast of this movie has not done the same. <br /> <br /> This is an outrageously accomplished film. Red Foxx, one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century, is as funny as yesterday, Michael Warren (who later appeared on the hit television series HILL STREET BLUES) competes with Foxx to see who can do worse , and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; truth be told, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson, and a special participation of Wayland Flowers have some spark - and, unfortunately, this is only in comparison with the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> It's not just the badly executed movie, it looks bad. According to film folklore, this was the first major effort to be filmed on videotape, which was then transferred to the celluloid for design purposes - and, believe me, it shows. The film has the look of a bad 1970s comedy to the painted horizon seen through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad they look funny, but NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU? is not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this film in two words: I miss that. Do not buy, do not rent it, do not touch with a 10-foot pole. Just retreat slowly and then run like hell. <br /> Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
