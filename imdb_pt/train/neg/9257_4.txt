If you are waiting for ANY new thing, you have chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of their predecessors might be good. Maybe the producer and maybe the director, but I hope they were not serious when they did this thing. This whole movie is like making a great DVD hit of the first 3 movies, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
