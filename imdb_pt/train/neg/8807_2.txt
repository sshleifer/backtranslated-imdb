I chose "Dead Creatures" because I thought it was a zombie movie like "28 days" or something ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens except for a group of women who seem to have been infected by a strange virus that makes them eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> That plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> FILM VERY MUCH. <br /> <br /> * My fee: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
