SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie sounded cool ... if you had never seen a * good * ninja movie. Cheesy music from the 80's ... cheesy dialogues ... tacky acting ... and martial arts sequences that go far beyond anything. The coolest scene is at the beginning ... with an old Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach ... several ninjas dressed in black try to get close to him and it looks like he's very intent on hitting the ball to notice ... suddenly he sticks his hand in the golf bag and ... no, I will not ruin it for you ... if you have the misfortune to see this movie, you will thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen video or something. A bunch of Caucasian heroes are trained in how the ninja "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Strange, these guys do not seem to fight better after training than before ... oh well, the movie moves very quickly. The fight scenes may not be great ... but they are plentiful ... and the exaggerated sound effects are good for some laughs.
