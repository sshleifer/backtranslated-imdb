After being immensely entertained with Mr. Brosnan's performance as an idiot in "The Tailor of Panama" (which I rate on 10/10 through the board: cast, acting, script, story, editing, rhythm, music, emotional impact , etc.). I anticipated this movie. I was extremely disappointed. It is a screenplay that does not read a movie, vulgar to be vulgar, bankrupt in every respect that "The Tailor of Panama" is rich and satisfying. It is the fault of the writing and direction of the screen. I sat in the theater waiting for the "good part"; never came. I did not even laugh or cry, although a line of dialogue made me smile. Worth $ 7? Difficultly.
