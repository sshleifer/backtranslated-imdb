When I saw the previews of this movie, I thought it might be dumb, but at least it will be funny. Well, I was wrong. Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their lives, the way they tried to convey that message was horrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But in the end, I could almost predict what stupid accident will happen next. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.
