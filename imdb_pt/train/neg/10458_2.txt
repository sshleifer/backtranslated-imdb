I got into this movie with hype expectations, which would be insightful and uplifting. Certainly more than a cheap promo for the band "Wilco". <br /> <br /> Instead, we became very depressed and whining about "the process," a dishonorable and undoubtedly one-sided portrayal of band members. who was expelled by singer / songwriter prima donna, a guttural confession of the member's fallen friend - for about 18 years - saying that "friendship had run its course," and this tearful, non-revealing story about how a record company "hurt its feelings, "pouring them out, just so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other record companies (oh, the tension ... no!) They tried their best to make it sound like it was a tension, but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that did not exist. This does not even take into account the long periods in which we received many of his most recent songs without any plot, insight or even a decent job in cinematography. The forced attempts of emotional sincerity or reasonable outlook on life made me sick to watch. <br /> <br /> From the movie, this band sounds like a bunch of little babies looking for a voice they do not know. I have and I think they are some kind of guardians of the art of music, which they definitely are not. And I thought the song sucked, and I could not even understand the lyrics because of the vocalist's grunting style. <br /> I give 2/10.
