Being myself a filmmaker, and possessing a somewhat somber and subversive sense of humor, I found it a delight when I took home "My Wrongs ..." (not that the DVD cover gives anything, instead opting for ambiguous) citation of controversial director, Chris Morris, "a short including scenes"). I should have known better, and avoided this tasteless (and often offensive) piece of twoddle. <br /> <br /> The church scene is disgusting to watch (especially since we are all very familiar with Morris's distorted attitude to pedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and has no other purpose than to shock. As this movie is labeled as a comedy I will never understand. <br /> <br /> The runner comment sounds like a new idea in principle (having been a runner is often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the shooting process), however, unfortunately this is not the case on here. Instead, we're treated to some public high school students talking about dogs in movies, before concluding that there are no really good movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single celluloid frame. <br /> <br /> To say that this film leads to nothing would be a euphemism. It depends too much on his lofty style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely disturbed and unsatisfied. His overly simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both obvious and ill-illustrated. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately it can not convince. , to entertain, clarify and ends up being annoying. If you want to see a great short work, I strongly recommend "It's a Wonderful Life of Franz Kafka" by Peter Capaldi.
