In what could have been a mill run, mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties (the subtle period of "free love"), the creators of this movie piled up a ridiculous scenario after a ridiculous scenario and ended with a small cherry trite in the top, happy forever after you're done. At no point did I feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in her troubled middle class free-living life, nor did she feel for the emasculated Liev Shrieber. The plot slowly walks to its predictable and pathetic conclusion and the only interesting and watchable thing about this movie is the stunning topless of Diane Lane. Here's a hint, it takes about 30 minutes in the movie. Advance to that part and skip the rest.
