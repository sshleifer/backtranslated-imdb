This movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but in that he is young. Donald Sutherland appears as an amateur. Because? Because the script is horrible, the adaptation is horrible and the actors seem bored and half-hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it would end and I hung up halfway. The director has done a very poor job and although I have not read the novel, it certainly is a missed chance. The atmosphere that this movie is trying to evoke and the message and story never reach the public. In a word, it's a TERRIBLE movie.
