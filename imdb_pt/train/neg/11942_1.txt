Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts badly and only deteriorates. Katherine Heigl is regretfully miscast in a role Lolita and Leo Grillo manfully fights with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character. The only member of the cast with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who considers him a villain and goes completely overboard with his role. The script is ghastly, the acting is awful and it has plot holes big enough to cross a two-story bus! It's also the sexiest movie I've ever seen! Katherine Heigl's character is completely unfriendly. She is seen as an evil and seductive seductress who draws the poor and innocent married man to betray his wife. It is implied throughout the film that she is a minor, and the message that accompanies this plot is just a beggar belief! In the end, she is not even able to redeem herself by throwing the man who obviously (ha!) Becomes insane with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, thus redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
