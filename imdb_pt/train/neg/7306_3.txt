Truly one of the most terrible movies I've ever had. I never really took the time to write one of these, but I felt compelled to, after witnessing this outrage to the movies, and feel a little distressed for wasting my time on a piece of shit to be honest. There were so many parties that infuriated me with their total randomness and lack of sense (for example, when did police ever shoot people with infectious diseases?) When did the hospitals go through these people for lack of healing? outside in her robe while carrying a gun while she rolled on the bed?). Besides, the characterization - as we almost expected in such films - was horrible (for example, the way the blond guy - I do not remember his damn name and I do not give a damn) turned completely against his girlfriend and ran away to leave her, la) and I ended up wanting them all to know the terrible purposes! The production was horribly disconnected and the cinematography nothing to write.
