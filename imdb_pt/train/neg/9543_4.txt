Let's face it - if you rented a STDVD sequel to a forgotten gem from the 80's, and hoped it was better than the one mentioned above, then you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long list of unnecessary sequences that the DVD market filled so easily. Movies like this do not need spoilers because you already know them. <br /> <br /> The "plot" for this "movie" is as follows: Nerd meets girl; girl likes to nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd gets accidentally involved with the Top Secret Government computer; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl end up being pursued by government actions in the other country; nerd and girl meet some important old guy who dies at key point in the "movie"; nerd and girl are caught; the top secret government computer goes crazy; nerd is hired to hit Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames movie; nerd saves the day; nerd is placed. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> The acting, the script, the effects, the soundtrack and the cinematography are what you would expect - B-grade. Some familiar faces are here, and unless you're a mega fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid this. Granted, the movie will not make you crazy enough to eat your own fingers, seeing this, so if you like STDVD sequences with cheap appearance then you are at home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mathew Broderick was very involved with some "masterpiece" that he could not even make a five-second share in this. But can you blame him?
