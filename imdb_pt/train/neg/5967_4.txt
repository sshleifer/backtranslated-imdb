Just think, it cost a total of $ 250,000 to make "Clerks". How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to make this glorified music video? A cast virtually unknown, two or three sets, no special effect I could see ... I know, must have been spent on that tension-filled, economically and skillfully worked script. Shoot, this bar must have cost a package. Anyway, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not get caught dead producing anything for less. I'm surprised he did not explode anything. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was not a horrible movie, I guess. Female leaders seemed to have good chemistry and the soundtrack was good. IMO It seems only a shame that this mediocre project was made for $ 5 million without any loss to production, and another 6 $ 5 million worth of films could also have been made.
