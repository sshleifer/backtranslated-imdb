Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science goes out the window and "belief" and "consensus" becomes the topic of discussion. <br /> <br /> It's because of this that I give a negative note to Al Gore's Documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting intelligent discussions, he kept the debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus". Of course, when you are trying to sell the world to spend trillions of dollars to "stop global warming," it can be a problem to tell the scientific truth: we do not know how much of the current warming has been caused by beings humans. Maybe none of it, maybe a little bit, or maybe it got past the next Ice Age, and we were lucky we did not boil the planet. <br /> <br /> But the fact is you do not know. <br /> <br /> So we are invited to "believe" in "consensus". It does not matter that any scientist who moves away from "consensus" is ostracized. It does not matter that scientific research is about diverging from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in the consensus, nor did Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> So, why did so many contempt put on those same researchers who would advance the field by asking the difficult questions? If global warming is so uncontroversial, surely some people testing this theory can not be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This is the movie that I hoped Al Gore would have done. Istead, he chose to strengthen his support with the true "believers" of "consensus." <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
