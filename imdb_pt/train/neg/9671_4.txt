I would give maybe 6 or 7 to this advertisement movie because it shows when and how a propaganda movie becomes successful. If there are people who watch this play and think that "well then the Jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in World War II," then the film is very cleverly done to hide "why" and " how, "as well as mix and fake remarks about how people live. What else can a propaganda movie do? The part where an American movie about the Rothschild family is included is re-used very cunningly here, for example. The question of why the Jew keeps his wealth away from the official is never questioned. No one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social stratum. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or, the level of disgust) in the film slowly increases and the end of solution of the facts of the film the goal and the duties of advertising. The public would leave in joy and gratitude the times that are coming ... well done. <br /> <br /> In the film, there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the public. The movie is kind of a story today, so there's no need to mess around with it really. However, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful observer may find relevance to the cultural hatred, violence, descivilization and problems of today's integration. Overall, rubbish good.
