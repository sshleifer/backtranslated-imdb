I borrowed this movie from the library and I think it can be delicious. How am I wrong! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the movie, it's very painful to watch the scene with her. She's a pretty girl, but in this movie, she's not seductive, but I'm going to have to witness her weird attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. It's so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And the dialogue of the film is so pretentious, and lacking the humorous fact that makes it acceptable. <br /> <br /> Totally failed.
