When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE debuted at Radio City Music Hall, I was foolish enough to believe it would be as entertaining as some of Lassie's early films. No. The story was terrible, the Sherman brothers' songs were well below normal, the characters were uninspired, and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had seen much better days. So also, I was interested to see what ALICE FAYE's contribution would be like, since she'd been away from the screen for so many years and always been so attractive in her previous roles on Fox. Alice was also disappointed by the senseless script and by the unflattering photograph. Another disappointment. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here, nothing remotely interesting for an adult to enjoy - and clearly, no magic gift for anyone. You can skip this without losing anything.
