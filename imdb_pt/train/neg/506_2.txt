(aka: The Bloodsucker takes the dance) <br /> <br /> Many naked girls in this with some lesbo scenes. The film must happen in Ireland, but it looks more like Rome and Adriatic to me. <br /> <br /> Gothic lesbians are invited to a Earl's Island castle over the weekend. One by one they seem to be losing their mind because of a madwoman running around. <br /> <br /> It's not too scary or bloody and the rooms seem to be lit with spotlights even though the candles are lit. Go ahead ... (sic) <br /> <br /> Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for eroticism and nudity. Directed by Euro Terror Actor Alfredo Rizzo, this is a snoozer. <br /> <br /> Very boring 2 of 10
