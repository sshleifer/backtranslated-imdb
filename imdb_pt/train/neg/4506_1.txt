The American filmmakers decided to make a movie that they think is Japanese. The badly represented characters, the actors are not even Japanese, and the set is cheap, unreal and definitely does not represent Kyoto in the early 20's and 30's. Anyone who has ever read the book understood that the writers did not add any extra value to differentiate the film from script. Worse, they even changed the original plot with some bullshit. Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well-known Chinese actors who have previously joined in a hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw a Chinese movie and they represent Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors together again makes the film even more ridiculous. The last scene of Quentine Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than the one in this movie.
