This movie is one of the worst crap I've ever seen. I literally have a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie. The CGI was horrible and the story was just a waste of paint. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-Can-Find-Anything except that he can not work his own helicopter correctly. The biggest problem was the split-screen camera job. I felt like I was watching Brady Bunch or something, just that they were not different people in the boxes, just closes and different views of the same thing. I can only imagine that the actors really needed the money, because this movie was not worth the movie it was filmed in.
