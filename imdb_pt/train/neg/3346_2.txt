Cheezy action movie starring Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a military man who retired into a teaching job. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides he will hang him. Things get risky when, as they watch a group of students in detention, some thieves take over the school as a base for armored car theft. Your Dolph against the bad guys in a fight to the death. Of jaw-dropping in the grindhouse-era exploration films, where bandits dressed as punks and some of the bad women had shiny hair. What an idiotic movie. Watchable in a I can not believe that people made this kind of way, this is an action movie that was probably doomed from the beginning before the low budget, fake separatist ensembles and poor action direction were even a blink at one producer. See how late it is in the movie when the cars cross the school (do not ask) they hit the security tower (do not ask, since it looks more like a prison than a school) and breaks its poorly constructed form. it does not look like previous photos). What did the gods of bad movies do? In fact I've been puzzled since it was directed (?) By Sydney J Furie, a very good director who made films like The Boys in Company C. His skill failed, or was it hopeless from the start and did not he? Does it really bother you? It's a turkey. An assistive, but a turkey, though.
