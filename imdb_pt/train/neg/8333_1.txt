This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. The acting is poor and the plot is almost incomprehensible. Whether or not you like light ships or any ships, this is irrelevant. As for special effects, the film has none. The whole crew was probably on the boat in rough water, not in a studio, and when some of the men are "stabbed" (if you can say that), their reactions are totally unrealistic. Guns are quieter than a mute. How this movie could have two awards poses serious questions about the state of the human mind. Well, that's about it. This review is probably more fun to read than the movie is to watch. If someone is thinking about watching you or buying you, I would seriously advise against this for obvious reasons. I said it included a spoiler. If the fact that some people are stabbed and a weapon fired is a plot supply. I suppose it's because they are the only good parts of the movie.
