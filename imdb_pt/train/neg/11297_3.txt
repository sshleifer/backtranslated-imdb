Jenny Neumann (from the sexist espionage film MISTRESS OF THE APES, the American detective HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who has a leading role in Australian production. She is a virgin, because when she was a girl, she saw her mother having sex and accidentally caused the car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, a black glove killer rounds the theater cutting people with shards of glass. <br /> <br /> THE GREATEST SPOILER <br /> <br /> The killer is obviously Helen (she speaks in the voice of her dead mother, washes the blood of the hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a child!), but this has a free heavy breathing POV camera job and hides the child's identity. Killer to the end, as if it were supposed to be a big surprise. The whole cast seems obsessed with talking about, having or trying to have sex and, in one case, even blackmailing their way to being able to lead. There is a bit of nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, photography is obscure and the edition (by Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and produced) is terrible. The theater scene for a horror film predates Soavi's film with the same name and Argento's OPERA (both better than this) for five years, and Neumann is very attractive.
