There are actually two sections of this movie. First of all, there is the laughable prologue to the film, which is so hysterical and confusing that it would be almost appropriate for Troy McClure of 'The Simpsons' to make the narration. <br /> <br /> So the rest of the film begins (beginning with a title song that does not really fit in with the rest of the film) which, although technically well, is killed by a vague, inconsistent and unconvincing plot and does not only by uninteresting characters, but by characters that do not make sense. This is especially so with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, who was supposed to be in the plot and part of the 'organization' all the time still what would have happened had Hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when he broke out? In that case, he would have been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character, which in the end he still is. <br /> <br /> The general problem with the movie is that it does not want to put any detail on who or what. is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to suggest that a certain section of society would be able to create such an organization, and instead they hoped that the lack of explanation would suffice and that the public would make its own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film fails on all levels.
