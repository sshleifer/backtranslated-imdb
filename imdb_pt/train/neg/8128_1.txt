OK, do not let my resume fool you. This movie SUCKS HARD. But the worst movie ever? This movie was terrible in ways that people should not have to break their brains to describe. But it's no worse than Hands: the hands of fate, hobgobblins, spider island horrors, or a small handful of movies. As a review, the movie sucks, it sucks. Do not see it without the MST or you may develop health problems. But there are worse movies.
