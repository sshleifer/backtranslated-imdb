This movie was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It does not seem to have a plot, but the time you realize this is way beyond the beginning of the movie, so you have to watch the movie a long time to acknowledge the director's total incompetence, also known as the and we do not believe in Willem Dafoe in this movie, he's a clone, because the true Dafoe, as we know of "Apocalypse now" and "the saints of the blessing dock," would never agree to such a script . <br /> <br /> Duh, (Da) foe wrote this closed design along with his twenty years minus the baby. This film begins with the credits of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the two writers, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the director, Colagrande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (the story); Widow knows face, face hits widow, widow smashes windshield with face that hit her. <br /> <br /> Title in Holland; The black widow (different title, same bullshit). <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !!! It's a total waist of time !!!
