I thought it was a movie located in New York: wrong! It is a small British countryside. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama ... Well, until the last third, because after the story becomes totally "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word for a French presidential term. That means, almost meaningless, even the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What have I left behind? Maybe, a good actress duo: Yeah, I know, they're 3 friends, but the redheaded cop is a bit invisible to me. The high doctor surprises by his punch, and McDowell offers a good performance as usual, everything in a delicate, soft and almost silent attitude. This kindness intrigues me because, like other artists or directors, the same pattern is being repeated. In her case, it is how, whatever the film, it is always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who live endless different stories. I still do not know how to set the limit (or merge) between the artists and the works. <br /> <br /> Another positive side of this film is its feminine touch and the different interesting points of view. Women have their own way of life, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a unique and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people do. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is quite visible, but the grand finale cuts off the desire for a next vision.
