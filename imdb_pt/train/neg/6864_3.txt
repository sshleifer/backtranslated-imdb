There is a bit of spoiler below that can ruin the surprise of the unexpected and truly fun scene of the ONE in this movie. There is also information about the first film in this series. <br /> <br /> I got this movie on DVD, which someone gave as a gift to my roommate. It came as a set along with the first film in the series "Blind Dead". <br /> <br /> This film was certainly much worse than the first, "The Night of Blind Terror". In addition, many of the features of the first film have changed significantly. To begin with, the film was nicknamed in English (the first was subtitled), which I usually find to distract. <br /> <br /> The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Templars was involved in hideous and secret rituals. After the discovery of these crimes, the local peasants killed the Templars in such a way that their eyes can no longer be used, preventing them from returning from hell to take revenge. We then jumped into modern times, where, because of some event, the Templars came from the dead to take revenge on the villagers whose ancestors had messed them up first. Of course, since undead knights do not have eyes, they can only find their victims when they make some kind of noise. The Templars were a secret order, circa the twelfth century, coming out of the Crusades They were only for about 150 years, before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the pope and others. Because they were secret, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, particularly for initiation. Also, because of the way society was organized, you did not necessarily have church officers overseeing things, which meant they did not have an inner man when things got hot. And, because of the nature of their trials, they were tortured in confession. The order was stronger in France, but it existed in Portugal and Spain, where the films take place. <br /> <br /> Where the first film had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking blood directly from the body of the virgin (chest shots here, of course, this is a horror movie after all), and then once that the knights return to life, they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; all this disappears. You still have the same scene (redone, not the same footage) of them sacrificing the virgin, but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it. So when they come back, they simply cut people with their swords or trap people to death, what I have to say is a far less effective way of disrupting your audience. There is also a problem of time: in the first film, the dating is much closer to the Templars, where here they are saying that it is the 500 year anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake, which would be around 1473. And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well. In the first, they peck at the crows. Now they are simply exhausted, and in a very ridiculous way. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and maybe it was just me, but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this movie (though it died). Not really a problem, since the film is completely different and not a sequel in the direction of a continuation, but strange, however. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this movie is the rich one who uses a movie. child to distract the undead while he pauses for the jeep. The child's father had already been tricked by this rich man in an attempt to get the jeep, so he leaves and tells her to find her father. It comes a little out of the blue and is easily the funniest scene in the movie. Of course, why the child does not die at this moment is beyond me, and disappointed by the horror fans. <br /> <br /> I could not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad it becomes funny, so it turns out to be a mediocre horror film. Most of the film has several people hiding in a church, each making several attempts to go alone to escape the blind dead that surround them. When the movie ends, you are not surprised by the outcome; in fact, very disappointed. If you are into the novelty of watching a Spanish horror film, see the first movie, which at least has some innovative ideas and results not so expected.
