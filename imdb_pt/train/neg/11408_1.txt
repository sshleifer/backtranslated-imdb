That was just terrible. I read this book for school, I did As in all tests, and to see it like this! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 of the Outer Space and Hudson Hawk together. The thing that made this movie so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself. First of all, it was done at Hallmark. Secondly, the acting was terrible. Third, it was completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad that I asked to be waived. Basically, I'd rather watch Wild Instinct 2 watch it. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. No one would want to watch it. It was horrible. HORRIBLE!
