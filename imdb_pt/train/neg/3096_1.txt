To begin with, "Hobgoblins" try to imitate the most successful "Gremlins". That's bad enough, but they do not even try to do something like a movie here. Instead, it's more like a bargain basement, everything must go from embarrassing scenes, inappropriate sound effects, acting like tasteless tapioca, and a script that takes everything that humans deem sacred in their movies and plays them through the old tube - oaro <br /> <br /> The plot? Grrrr ... Nosy children track gremlin-like creatures in the movie before killing people, projecting their fantasies. Sounds cool, does not it? Well, look at that wall on the other side of your room? Run to the right, top speed, face first. See, this is cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare to doubt? Quickly, name something else where one of the leaders has been beyond that. What other scripts have writers done since "Hobgoblins"? Name another Rick Sloane director effort. How many "Hobgoblins" action figures do you have? Watch? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can not believe it took me so long to write about such a horrible movie. I'd rather write about more important things; such as the separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, that kind of thing. But no, "Hobgoblins" is and is bad - bad as your grandparents wallpaper, bad as pink flamingos on your lawn, bad as underwear that says "Home of the Whopper" ... and I think <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and the robots fight valiantly, but no matter how hard they try, they can do so much with "Hobgoblins" before realizing that, yes, the director needs to kick in the shuttle. Really very difficult. <br /> <br /> One star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
