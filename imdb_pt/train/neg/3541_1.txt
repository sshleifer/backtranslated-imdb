What we have here is a movie about how the pursuit of money and revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something. Guy Ritchie, a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites more than he can chew on this one. <br /> <br /> His use of the modern noir film to deal with the theme of a man breaking free by swallowing his pride, being kind to his enemy and giving all his money falls flat on the ground. When Jason Statham's character is no longer afraid of Ray Liotta, he apparently leaves Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off the final scene. Because? Basically, you can not set up a mobster like the Liotta character, who presumably came to his position displaying the kind of relentless behavior evident throughout the film, only then to have led him to suicide for nothing more than a pity smile. face of Statham's character. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying I'm missing the point ... I'm not. I understood everything? Choose the pursuit of riches and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be gentle with your enemy and it will confuse you with self-destruction. This seems to be the essence of the film and in itself is not a bad premise for a story, though hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the ability to make movies to perform it. By the time even Guy Ritchie notices this, he seems to get bored with the story and starts to insert red lies: The scene where Statham is knocked over by a car - Why? The filming of some scenes like Marvel comic animations ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many loose topics and unanswered questions left at the end of the movie that you could have it all in 2001 and about it. try to find out, or simply accept that there are no answers and each viewer will interpret things in his own way. Myself? I was so bored by the pompous tone of the film that I just did not care. Frankly, the ending could not come so soon, so I did not have to sit down any longer with this pretentious psychobobism. <br /> <br /> A waste of two hours of my life.
