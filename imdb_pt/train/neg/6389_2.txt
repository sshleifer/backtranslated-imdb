I waited almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking it could be an understated work, a period animation was no longer the quality it had once been. He starred in one of the best movie villains of all time, was based on a beloved series of children's books and was a Disney Studios production. What could be wrong with that? As it happens, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and the scandal of Henry Mancini are the two saving graces of the film. The price is wickedly nice, and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring class to a project that otherwise belongs to obscurity. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the film, though full of inappropriately adult situations, still suffers from a completely dull script, a generic voice job, terrible songs and a lazy animation that would not be out of place . on any of the Disney TV shows in the mid-1980s. That was a complete disappointment to me. It's amazing that this movie was almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Costing a fraction of that, an independent studio produced something more creative in its trailer than GMD has in its endless runtime. <br /> <br /> The extra star that prevents this from being "horrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
