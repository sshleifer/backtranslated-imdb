And the Oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye. Seriously, his name should be said with the same respect as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this movie proves it. His character Herman was one of two reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight gave this misalignment more than slightly disturbed a lovely and frightening behavior that led him to expect a bigger role throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The other motive is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being in the medical profession I have to give praise to the expert performance of a hypochondriac prone to self-pity. Although other "medical errors" have given a brief chuckle, especially when the good doctor examines the medication from his fellow doctors ... "Well, keep giving it to me." Unfortunately, these two exceptional performances failed to keep me awake through three Unbearable slow movie attempts. The plot is predictable with only a few minor twists. Filming while tearing out a legitimate phantom atmosphere was more productive in making me yawn - yes, you can use a lot of shade. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - watch once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when awake and full of caffeine.
