I see where some people involved in this fiasco wrote reviews to share their side of the story and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they basically came with excuses - rewrites, budget constraints, production formats, etc. - simply highlights how bad this movie is. And my criticism in panning is not directed personally, but simply a warning that this is not the cut. <br /> <br /> It's watchable, but almost not. There are holes in every corner, the dialogue is confused with ridicule, and the end is telegraphed a mile away. The modest and interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a reconnaissance team drowns in silly dialogues like making a meal in the middle of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would you help us with some Hamburger Helper Sally, among us being killed by these automated carpet scanners? Apparently, this elite team, equipped with the latest gadgets and armor of red plastic marvels, does not have access to MREs. Once they enter the last rooms, they treat the place more like a four-star motel than a deadly meeting zone. <br /> <br /> The reason for the encounter with the fearsome Tower is that it can not be killed alone. . However, just one scene ago, the hero who made this case abandoned King to do just that. There is? Vivian Woo was attractive and by far the best character represented in the film. But that's not saying much.
