I read Ben Mezrich's novel The Grim Reaper a few years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Although it has been years since I first read the story, the differences between the novel and the film is gigantic. Very important elements, which have made the whole thing plausible, have just been written or changed to bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot seems interesting to you: go and get the romance. Its much, much, much better. <br /> <br /> Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic conspiracy by Ben Mezrich.
