Dull Haunted House Thriller finds an American family moving to a 200-year-old house in Japan, where a violent suicide love triangle occurred. <br /> <br /> The new setting is the only element of interest in this very slow horror movie from the director of Motel Hell. The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat unstable scenes that rarely seem to be getting anywhere. <br /> <br /> An obvious example is a fairly old scene in which the male leader visits a temple after realizing that his home is haunted as the monk had previously warned. The monk narrates the story of the house (which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence) and then the film simply cuts to something else. Earlier the monk offered to help. Well, where's the help? The family remains in the haunted house as things get worse and worse, and no mention of the monk is made until almost the end when he appears again to do what he should have done an hour earlier - try to direct the spirits. outside the house, although at this point it is difficult for viewers to worry. There are some (probably) involuntary disagreements in seeing the American actors in the end being possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts, I say probably because the scene is more than a small reminiscent of the chainsaw duel of the motel of the same director Hell who was more obviously meant to be fun, but overall this is a forgettable flop.
