An obvious b-grade effort to make money at the Sierra Hostel / Buzz, my expectations for this movie were low (really low!) And still managed to disappoint on every level. The acting is so bad that neither is funny, the plot is nonexistent and the only scare was realizing that I had lost 1 hour and 21 minutes watching! I am surprised to note that 34 people gave a rating of 10 stars. I can only suspect that 33 of them are Cast and Crew. Is 34 possibly the parent director? - although I made sure she would find it hard to go higher than 2! DVD extras include a one-hour "making of" feature. Which raises the question: "Why?" (though perhaps it helps to demonstrate what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
