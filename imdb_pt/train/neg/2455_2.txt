I remember going to see the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents and being beautiful back then. Of course, I was seven at the time. <br /> <br /> Just before the Jackson movies, my wife and I rented this movie, since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic. <br /> <Ralph Bakshi ran out of money midway through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to cut corners drastically in this production. Since this film was made primarily with rotoscopy, the technique of animation for people on a budget, this is saying something. Much of this film is animation only in the looser sense of the word. There are some scenes that are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on them. Because of budget constraints, the film - already a compression of "The Fellowship of the Rings" and part of "The Two Towers" - has been further reduced. What you get is a kind of cinematic version of the Precipice Notes from the books. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad, the animation brings a warmth to it, which I think is missing in Jackson. movies. It is good to imagine what could have been with decent funding. <br /> <br /> This movie is also noteworthy for having the continuation that never came. Several years later, a half-hour TV special was shown, which was intended to shut things down. All I'm going to say about it is that it was a musical.
