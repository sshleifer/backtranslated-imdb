What are the people here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you. I was so bored that I left the theater. What about these things? I only laughed once and not even that strong. Whoever enlightens this film must be taken to the street and beaten. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this is crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" look like a classic. He's up there with the junk like "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst ever. AVOID ALL THE COSTS! I thought the studio would be distributing money to people when they left the theater as a sign of their apology, but to my amazement this was not happening. I do not think I'll ever see that money again or two hours.
