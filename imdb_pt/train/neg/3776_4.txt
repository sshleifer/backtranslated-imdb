Believe me, I wanted to like "Spirit". The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how old-fashioned it was to see the old-fashioned animation again, as if the last pencil cartoon had been released twenty years ago, and the even more stupid comments about how computers made the old techniques obsolete, increased my blood ... but then the insubstantial insipid banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of "Spirit" increased my blood even more. <br /> <br /> The character designs are generic, the animation (partly as a result) merely competent, the direction of art as a whole is so dull that you wonder how it could have happened (we know, from " The Prince of Egypt, "and" The Road to El Dorado, "that there are talented artists at Dreamworks), and the sophisticated use of CGI is in every case poorly evaluated. (Why do they bother?) There is not a single thing worth looking at. In a cartoon, this is fatal. <br /> <br /> But it gets worse ... <br /> <br /> Horses can not talk, but are much more anthropomorphized and are not convincing than the deer in "Bambi", which can. And it seems that, in a way, horses can talk. Spirit himself makes the prologue (sounding to the entire world as a chosen 21st-century actor in a California mall), and from then on, his relaxed and decidedly improbable narration is little missing from the soundtrack, or expresses a feeling that the work, however bad it may be, was not able to express it twice as well. This prologue, by the way: (a) contains information that the Spirit, we later discovered, knew the way of knowing; (b) expresses ideas that the Spirit would not have the power to express, even if it could speak; (c) includes new junk like "This story may not be true, but it's what I remember"; and (d) it will give innumerable children (production is released, I presume that at the age of six) the impression that horses are native to North America is a kind of truth in which the common ancestor of domestic horses, zebras ERA native to North America - but all species of horses on the continent were extinguished long before the first humans arrived, and the Mustangs of the Spirit herd (which supposedly "belong here as the grass of the buffalo") were descendants of horses introduced by Europeans. <br /> <br /> So the prologue bothered me a bit. <br /> <br /> Whenever Spirit speaks, Bryan Adams sings, sounding as usual, as if he has a throat infection - and it's not THAT. he sings or even sings, it's what he sings: fluffy narrative ballads that contribute even less if possible to the narrative spoken by Spirit, and that sound as if they all had exactly the same melody (although I was paying close attention and was able to discern that they probably did not). If at least one or two Bryan Adams and the guy pretending to be a horse could have the SHUT UP, the film could have taken its true form: mediocre and derivative instead of falling on the chin.
