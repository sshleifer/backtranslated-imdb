I made the big mistake of watching this whole movie a few nights ago. God is still trying to recover. This movie does not even deserve an average of 1.4. IMDb must have 0 votes for movies that really deserve it like this. A 1.4 is too high. <br /> <br /> I had heard that this movie was horrible, but I really did not think a movie could be that bad especially in this day and age. I imagined that all the horrible god movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s. My god was wrong. Trust me personally, this movie really sucks. It is beyond horrible; is beyond the pathetic; is beyond any kind of word I can think of for that. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the Best Picture of the Year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND (which until now was the worst movie I've ever seen) seems to deserve some Oscars compared to this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I seriously can not believe the creators of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort to produce a Hollywood movie. This has no business being called a movie. In the first 25 seconds of the movie, I seriously thought about attending a theater class at school trying to make a short film. Or better yet, I thought it was a little Saturday night Live ripoff skit from the real thing. I mean, it looks exactly like this. The acting is horrible; the whole movie looks like it was filmed with a 20-year VHS video camera. the special effects ....... good Lord Spell back in the day had better special effects than this movie. The scene in which he is shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy. I mean seriously, my Intro to Acting class from 4 years ago in college, we could all have a better movie together than that. And the worst part of the whole movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my god, I'll almost take you there. I have a strong stomach, but wow that was awful. Some people should never be naked and he is one of them. The plot of this movie just seems to go nowhere. They talk about legal issues we've never heard of again; Ben talks about getting into music we've never heard of again; Arthur says he's looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is that he's running a porn store. Everything about the movie is just plain awful. <br /> <br /> This really does not have much to do with my criticism, but just so everyone knows, I'm not a gay man. I do, however, support the rights of gays and I believe that we should all be treated as equals. And I would support any homosexual in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who by the way seems to curse all other words. (WHERE IS THE F *?) Hahaha But I did not want anyone to think I hated this movie just because it was two gay guys. It has nothing to do with it: it would have been so horrible from a movie if <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie to see if it was really as bad as they say. <br /> <br /> Let this be a warning to everyone: JUST watch this movie if you just want to sit back and laugh at how some movies can still be pathetic in the 21st century. If you watch this movie and are really expecting a good movie or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you. /> In one last thought: How in the world there are 7 movies classified below the IMDb? There is no way to have 7 movies out there are worse than that!
