One of the main flaws in this film is that while the mockery of pretentious yuppies is satisfying, it does not realize that filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve to be ridiculed. One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand the art. While the film ignores this feature and instead focuses on their dinner misunderstandings, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie have the same smug taste in the movies the characters make in their choice of dinner. If those pompous characters in that movie have a video library at home, I'd bet American Psycho would be one of those movies.
