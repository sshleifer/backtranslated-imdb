During the cheap filming at the beginning of the Crazy Fat Ethel II video, I wondered if it was the same movie that was on the cover. Unfortunately it was. The story itself is unreflectively simple. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released in a middle house because of hospital overcrowding. She is by far the saneest resident watching while one man puts dead flies in another's soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the household's employees with a chocolate bar, after he attacks the cost-cutting measure to feed the residents. Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire loop on the stairs and then ... well, you got it. If all this sounds like fun, it's not. This movie was poorly done with cheap effects and even worse performance. The characters are so full of wood when they deliver their lines that they should be in front of a cigar shop. To make matters worse, half the film consists of flashbacks from Ethel's first film, Criminally Insane, which is a bit better. A very poor effort.
