Another weak entry in season three, "There really is not beauty?" however, has at least one fundamental element of the plot that is very different and, as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien that must be carried in a black box because its appearance is so horrible that it leaves humans insane. It's a pity that the episode can not live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think it was a mistake to always "show" the alien, since his real appearance does not approach in any way such a frightening formation; all we got was the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of different episodes, usually when the ship is going through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, Kollos's appearance may at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For a long time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos', which I found funny, but I disagree.) Spock is forced to mingle with Kollos at one point so the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety . This is done, but when Spock / Kollos returns to end the mental mess, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy, but ends up recovering with the help of Kollos's assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This may have been a really bizarre and excellent episode, but it is misdirected and presents itself as another badly performed show from the series last season.
