Larry Buchanan. Yes, the same guy who did "Attack of the Eye Creatures" and two (count: Two) conspiracy films about Marilyn Monroe. He's the culprit here. Adding in his growing stack of folders left over from Oliver Stone's conspiracy drawer, "Here's What's Growing Out There," here's "Down On Us." ie - "Beyond the Doors") which is the functional definition of historical imprecision. <br /> <br /> Forget everything you thought you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar, 'cause that's the truth, the three greats of rock' 60s were DYED GOVERNMENT because they were subversive or counterproductive with Truth, Justice and the American Way, or whatever, I knew it all. Anyway, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who look strangely at their real-life shadows (that is, if you close your eyes completely, turn your back and walk five miles away). show that, instead of their recorded deaths, A's good old USA lies in them! Yes, it's the truth! <br /> <br /> Man, I can not believe I watched this movie. str Credibility credibility to the point of fitting, are ridiculous; acting makes TV commercials look like a big drama, and if you watch honestly until the end, you deserve the final twist. You really do; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But as the man said, "Rock and roll is dead - live rock and roll." <br /> <br /> Not this movie, though. <br /> /> No stars for "Down on Us." And this is the movie audience describing the movie, by the way ...
