supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter. I would say 95% is manufactured. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this movie lost its odds when it became apparent that it had narration throughout the film, something I can not stand, and on top of that, the heroine of the story is so hateful and portrayed as an arrogant b! ch I just wanted to end her being shot in the head. is too incoherent, too flamboyant and too boring, is a guy who gives a crap story, and I really think big directors need to make films based on their own imagination or from a writer, not based on some ignorant life of a snobbish brat .
