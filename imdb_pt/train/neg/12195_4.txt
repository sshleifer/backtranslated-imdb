The plot is not so original. If anyone has seen "L'ultimo Bacio" there is nothing new. A rich family in Rome who lives daily life is boring and false, with everyone asking others what they think about them. Really annoying after half an hour, because it's simple to understand where the story will end. That's because it's simple to see the moralistic view of Muccino in this movie, so even the toughest parts seem normal. Summing up in the first 2 minutes of the movie would be enough and the purpose of the film has already been told. the family saw a 30-year-old, I do not like to see the film that wants to show reality, but by being consistent with their thoughts have to push situations more than normal. Really good as Muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and is the only reason it makes me not sleep in the movies, although always in the movie scream from the beginning. It may be good to see the family as they are in reality and not put the blame on something outside it. Morante was intense and great as always, but unfortunately in a bad movie!
