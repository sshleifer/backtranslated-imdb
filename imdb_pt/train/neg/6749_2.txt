This mess is so bad it does not even qualify as horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is completely wasted on this film. She's not even the villain. The rest of the actors look like the aspiring porn guys and the plot is so dumb I will not even mention it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip to the final credits to hear the next band TwoMarlowe performing "Better Than Sex" is total 80's Disco candy song. Nice up time song about Gambleing & Sex. Much more fun than "Bleed". Put it this way, When you have the equipment to copy videos, but only decide to record the song at the end of the movie, you have a really "bad" movie.
