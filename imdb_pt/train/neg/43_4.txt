This nasty video was initially banned in Britain and allowed last November, uncut. <br /> <br /> He introduces Playmate Playboy of the Month of October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The aperture cuts from side to side between Buchfellner and hazy images of the jungle. I'm not sure what the purpose was. It would have been much better to focus on the bath scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and kept in the woods to ask for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver) is sent to find her and the ransom. Of course, one of the hijackers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to spend his time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) laments incessantly. <br /> <br /> The ransom goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal? Oh yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a nasty video! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death) on the boat of the kidnapper. Montossé is very comfortably naked. Peter leaves them and leaves alone to find Laura, who has been captured so far. They spend their time having sex and do not see the danger approaching. Guts, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). Blood, decapitation, courage, full frontality, some great contortion of the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the phrase "They tore your heart," which is hilarious if you see the movie.
