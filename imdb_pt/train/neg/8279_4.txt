This movie had all the elements to be a clever and shimmering comedy, but for some reason it took the idiot route. Maybe he really did not know who his audience was: but it's hardly a man's movie given to the cast and plot, but he's too much of an asshole and an ass to entice women. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Legally Blonde and her sequel then this is like the disconcertingly awful sequel. Great actors like Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could have done a lot more, too. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing. Many things in this film were painted by numbers, the various montages of the uber-clich√©, the last minute "incomprehension", to the chaos of the children's party. This only suggests lazy scripts. <br /> <br /> It should be possible to find this nice movie if you do not take it seriously, but it's so brilliant you can do better than you'll probably feel frustrated and frustrated. increasingly disappointed as the scenes go by.
