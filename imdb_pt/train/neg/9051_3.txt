I was so excited when I discovered that this was available! I could not wait to see this. What a waste of energy! It's like that CD of rarities from your favorite band you found on the back of the rack at your local music store. Being a hardcore fan, you were sure it was a valuable discovery. But once you heard it, it became obvious why these dogs never made it to a real album. This DVD is recommended only to 'completists' who must have everything Lynch did. "Six Men Getting Sick" is visually interesting, but short and repetitive. Lacking the power of Lynch's later work "The Grandmother" is simply an immature job. It's tedious and looks like a student movie. But it was in the 70's ... It's only interesting if you expect to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of the images and sounds of your trademark. "The Alpahabet" is forgettable (not true! I do not remember anything!) "The Amputee" is useless. "Cowboy and French" is simply silly. "Lumiere" is the only one worthy of the group. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable to his best work. I had to attend this several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth renting or buying the DVD.
