My favorite quote from Crow was, as the car was coming off the cliff, "The movie is so bad that even the car wants to get out of it!" <br /> <br /> This had to be the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was seriously out there to scare you, which makes it even more fun! If it was not for the Mystery Science Theater, I would not be here today! :-P
