Terrible movie with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here he engages with a dead woman on the seabed. <br /> <br /> Rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman. Of course, it is the woman beneath the sea. His roommate, Lainie Kazan, soon ends up dead on the floor. <br /> <br /> An elderly Richard Conte plays a policeman and friend of Rome. When a local club owner is killed, the blame lies on Rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene. That's how bad that picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to provide the action. <br /> Raquel Welch plays the beauty up to the neck in intrigues. His acting takes a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired thug whose son is trying to outmaneuver him. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you do not know why the girl was murdered. Do not even bother asking.
