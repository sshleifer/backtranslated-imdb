John Wayne and Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on Indian soil, and for the attention of Martha Scott in this Republic Pictures movie taken from Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> An interesting Western species due to its characters and its more modern environment, with Wayne & Dekker playing the old and new factions of the West. It is based on a story by Thomson Burtis, who co-writes the screenplay along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell leads the professional way that fits his career. A rather mundane story is actually saved in its last third, where, fortunately, the action happens and we are treated with something like a wrist. The light-hearted approach to the romantic strand does not fit very well, and a glorious fight between the two protagonists is ruined by Rogell being unable to disguise the stuntmen who do the work. But hey, stuntmen deserve their moment of glory forever. Solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne, as usual, has a lot of screen charisma, particularly when shaking his pistol. But despite his better-than-usual Republican budget, it remains a movie of interest only to Wayne enthusiasts of the 1940s. 4/10
