This movie was painful to watch ... not in the good dramatic way that makes you shrink from emotions by well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I practically did that last sentence while I was), but in just an absolute boring way by more than two hours. Now, you may all think that I am just an ignorant critic who has no respect for Shakespeare or "artistic film production" ... well, you would be wrong in both cases. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I have watched many "artrusar" films, such as the surreal and well-done Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2. .. but that was just over two hours of Shakespeare's translation loss, way too naked (I can understand artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not at all the other shots of a movie !!!) He was meaningless and served NOTHING TO HISTORY !!!), and basically just making overly zealous films. I had high expectations for this film in what was said to be "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... but this was just an extreme disappointment. I gave this film a three ONLY because of the presence of Sir John Gielgud (who far surpassed all of the non-names in this film) and the set / scenography combination, since it made many scenes look like moving paintings .. However, much of this movie would have been better as just a painting with a scroll of text below it. A real disappointment ... perhaps if Zeffirelli had received the director's chair, it would have been much better. But this is the opinion of one member of the audience, many others may like this much more than I do. That being said, if you can not find this at any nearby video store (currently not on DVD), do not try to go too far out of your way to find it ... it's not really worth it.
