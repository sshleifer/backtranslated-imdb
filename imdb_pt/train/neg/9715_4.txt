This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the "rubber-bomb squad" years ago. The entire squad is made up of egocentric people who judge people whose actions date back to decades by the standards of 2007. Every veteran Vietnam character they've ever had turned out to be the killer unless he was another Vietnam veteran. There was only one black killer, and he was convinced by his white boss. The only Hispanic murderer was a "race traitor" who killed another Hispanic to incriminate a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two wealthy white boys committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey, writers: minorities and poor people commit murder as well. Only in this show are more high-class white killers. <br /> <br /> What's more, the arrests of people in their 70's, 80's and 90's for crimes committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real prosecution will press for murder, because that means the state will be stuck with their huge medical bills until they finally kick it. The state would be doing their families and insurers a favor. The prosecutor will only beg for involuntary manslaughter and they will not serve one day. The only really old criminals going to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high profile convictions increase the prosecution's careers.
