I just came in to comment on how incredibly stupid this movie is. Aside from being an oversight of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other type of terrorist story, this is the kind of movie that makes you enjoy watching a movie that can have the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when they get such a stupid script and clich√© to work on. It's bad enough if you moan once in a movie when you come across an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself groaning over and over again, you have to conclude that the director is not the brightest lamp in the movie business, nor are they the producers decided to bring this story to the screen in the first place. The cheapest rental actors you can apologize for taking on this task because they probably turned up to get money and exposure, not that part of that movie joke will award them awards or recognition. You may end up embarrassing them for having a judgment so weak as to involve yourself in such a loser. I do not see the point in summarizing the plot or even giving any example to prove my case, for to do so would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this disaster could bear. Just as studying well-made movies can inspire you to make a good work of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn by watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does not! Be warned.
