I tried as hard as I could to sit all the way through this annoying mess but I just could not do it. Brad Dourif was absolutely sucked in as a leader and the entire cast of support was only marginally worse. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is just ridiculous, from horrible acting to ridiculous FX, to stupid conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Complete waste of time; Do not bother yourself. Root canal therapy would be more enjoyable. Bamboo chips under the nails would be much nicer. <br /> <br /> Watching a Uwe Boll movie would only be a little worse than that. Get the idea?
