I apologize to everyone ... I know this is an "art" movie, but, wow, they should have given weapons to the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch. Although the design of the scene and the photographic direction have been excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a soundtrack was brutal. The shots of loooonnnng were very long. How long can you watch two people sitting there and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. I really had a hard time going through this movie. The performances were great, but how much of this gloomy, dark, uninspired stuff do you get? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise, this was a ripoff from Bergman. And I'm not a fan of him either. I think anyone who says he has enjoyed an hour and a half of it is lying.
