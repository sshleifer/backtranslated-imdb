The only thing that prevented this movie from being a total disaster was a couple of interesting style touches. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) Comic book death is somewhat derived from a scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie, which delivers death by cartoon. Still, it was well treated, especially seeing the ink bleed and the color being sucked. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is another good scene with a demonic motorcycle. <br /> <br /> That being said I was happy to get the cheap DVD in a store that went out of the sale because that was too bad. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time and both movies were equally annoying with the constant achievements that you have witnessed in a dream. However, where "Soul Survivors" has nothing to rescue him, or make any sense at all, this one at least had a couple of stylish notes referred to above. <br /> <br /> Curiously, the DVD lets you go into the 8 'nightmares' where something really happens, which is the only way to watch it. The script between the creative moments is quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
