Must agree with the other reviewer. This has to be the worst, much less western movie I've ever seen. Terrible performance, dialogue that was unimaginable and pathetic (much less completely unfit for supposedly being in the nineteenth century), and, oh, did I mention a battery exhibited prominently in the back of one of the characters? I was waiting for the microphone boom to fall in the middle of a scene. And the end? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ... completely awful. And yes, it contained all the clich√©s in the book, from the slow walk down the empty, dusty road to the laughable "let's remember when" shots when a main character dies. Luckily I saw this on free TV. Do not waste your time.
