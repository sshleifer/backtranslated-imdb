Have you watched a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have passed and suddenly you realize you've seen the movie before? This happened to me with "The Young Graduates". The video box cover, if you can find the video, is extremely misleading. I swear the two women on the cover are not even in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was born a decade later to appreciate the finer points of this movie or ... it's just mindless junk. I'm strongly inclined to the latter, but I think some out there have developed a connection to this movie. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. The plot. Let's see ... there must be a plot here somewhere. No, I can not find it. It's basically about some high school seniors acting stupidly, drugged and speaking in a language that was obsolete decades ago. One of the students has a crush on her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (whom he actually refers to as an iceberg), so he is receptive to the girl's advances. <br /> <br /> There are many dialogues around and a futile dialogue and lots of spastic dance. Our cat, BooBoo, was fascinated by the boys dancing in high school. She watched with incredible intensity as the dancers whirled and shivered on the dance floor. It is good to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
