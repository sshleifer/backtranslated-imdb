I am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything fancy and ridiculous is my game. So, imagine my spirit, I went to the local Rent Shop and I met Vampires Vs. Zombies The name is too much fun, you know that no one in the world could do something like that, it just has to be bad. <br /> <br /> And man, it's EVIL. After watching this horrific movie, I was speechless, literally. Me and my friend sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words "... man ... what?" Yes, I am a captivating individual. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick 'street review' plot; There is no, always, always in "WTF" mode. The characters; No development, forgettable. The music; Worse than pornography. The vampires; Your vampires? The zombies; Of them zombies? <br /> <br /> In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, it is so bad that I yearn to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch and be depressed.
