I've seen Arthur (the TV series and books) years ago and never really enjoyed the show (if you're a fan of this cartoon, sorry if I'm spoiling everything for you, but that's really what I think) A lot of people liked it , but I did not like it. <br /> <br /> The children's school characters seemed to fight all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were good to each other often, but gradually I got tired of the attitude of Arthur's complaint to everyone and his sister DW (however the name was written), and DW was a 4-year-old Arthur's sister who was sometimes picky (which might be why Arthur bothered her which his routines were, like his imaginary friend and his collection of stuffed animals etc.), Arthur's friends acted as teenagers instead of as they were in Arthur's books, and the parents, well, did not care much. <br /> <br /> The biggest cartoon was Rocko's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
