I do not know what it was about this movie that made me react viscerally against it. Maybe it was the characters who were so unpleasant and unattractive enough to worry. Maybe it was the messy mess. Maybe it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long earring and eyeliner. Maybe it was because at some point in the movie they all go out in music. Maybe it was because the 80s were never so 80s. Maybe it was because everything was a garish hyperbole. Maybe it was because a character pumped his fist while steering away from the camera during a fade. I do not know what it was that made me hate it, but if it means trying to watch it again I'm not willing to find out.
