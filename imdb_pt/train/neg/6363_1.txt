I still have not seen anyone slate this movie and I think I can be the first. <br /> <br /> It was horrible. I did not really watch the end of it. It was like watching a dull soap or really good (all the soaps suck). The actors were poor and the plot was bad. The person who rated you 10/10 has no idea what he's doing. The script was horrible. 2 The people were in a furious talk together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say something really good and hit him, but no. He says, "If you do this ... I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, watch out. Please do not watch this movie because ... IT'S CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Bad acting, bad fights, bad script. <br /> <br /> Do not watch! Of course this is in my opinion.
