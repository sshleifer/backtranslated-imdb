Melissa's sixteenth birthday is just around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with the boys. But it turns out that every guy she spends time with gets murdered in this 1980s horror movie. It's up to the local town sheriff, Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch), and her annoying two-piece mysterious daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday, Part 13), to get to the bottom of these murders. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the film and less on the murders themselves, and thus is able to differentiate itself from many of its Slasher brothers of the 80's. It does not hurt that Alesia has a large body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious by stating that the actress is over 18 and so convey that I am not overly perverted). On the other hand, the film is hampered by some plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a nasty theme, some that are used very often, and an ending that is somewhat anti-climatic. But good surpasses evil (evil). Give me a rent, but I would not buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, butt and butt <br /> <br /> My Note: C <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: An Introduction star Aleisa Shirley and Director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Cut version and theater of both film directors; Audio conversation with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals and Balalaika Conspiracy
