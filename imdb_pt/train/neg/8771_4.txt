Okay, I was bored and decided to see this movie. But I think the main thing that brought this movie was that there would be an hour of footage, so basically the same time repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Combining the troops and discussing the plan of attack, 2. Flashbacks for the wives of the men 3. The approach of the troops marching in a long line 4. Men climbing hill and firing, usually the first being hit in the head then 3 other men rescuing him. 5. Defeat the enemy and calling the base to tell about success 6. Men flashing back to the wives and singing 10-minute songs. That was the basic movie, and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times. and every time he did a flashback to the wives, he showed the man, then the wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback, so it took tons of time. Other than that, men could not kill their enemy except with bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and there was a lot of action, although the action was repetitive. Overall, I probably would not see it again, but it was not too horrible.
