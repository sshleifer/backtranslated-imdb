I can not say that this is the worst movie of all time, but personally I think that way because when it was originally released in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted on going see, and we in fact, STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) it's still the only "serious" movie that I remember where the audience started laughing at one point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the movie. When we got to the infamous (and endless) snake fight scene, I think everyone gave up. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can admit is the exuberant location. Oh, and there are Bo's breasts too, though their acting is so woody that nudity is unerotic and does not rate much more than an image of Playboy. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" in this movie is between Bo's. terrible acting and horrible direction of the husband. The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences ever filmed. However, this is one of those movies that is bad enough, it may be worth watching at the unintended mood level. Definitely the worst movie I ever paid to see.
