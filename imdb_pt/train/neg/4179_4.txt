# 1 Vampires Vs. Human <br /> <br /> # 2 Military-reject the squad of bullies as lifeguards from dangerous and unknown raids of Vampires. <br /> <br /> 3 female vampire sexy from the "good guys" side. <br /> <br /> # 4 Abundance of blood and action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4) main plot devices that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, then the next plot device can not stop you ... <br /> <br /> In outer space. <br /> <br /> The latter almost got me too, but I'm glad to have watched. In a pile of horrible horror straight into the video that is the Sci-Fi channel's Halloween marathon ... this movie is a breath of fresh air. He will stand up against any of the other science fiction channel offerings, and even against the other Vampire Natassia movie starred (who keeps giving money to Uwe Boll?).
