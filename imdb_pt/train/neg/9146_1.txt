Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does, he must be arrested on the spot ... at least for theft. Anyone who pays a penny to rent any junk should file a complaint and be compensated. This was innocently my first showing of your "job" ... and will be my last. Ed Wood sounds really good to me now. <br /> <br /> When I return this piece of garbage to the store, I will personally ask it to be taken off the shelf. An active supporter of gay cinema, I am outraged and irritated by the fact that this extremely talented, distorted man-child can distribute and pack something like that with a handsome kid stuck on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who fortunately does not has other acting credits on IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then marketed it as a "movie" for rent. Trust me, this has no place in any rack anywhere; it simply is not a movie in any sense of the word. Irresponsible and irresponsible trash like this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) For those who try to rent it because of coverage, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not as flattering to see in the film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice shirtless - that's it. Instead, the homemade Mroavich inflicts on us his own boyishness of disgusting and disgusting appearance. <br /> <br /> This "thing" he "set up" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, put up similar despicable garbage) are terrible at it. Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete untalented (in every field), desperate to grab any lost attention he can for himself. He is worthy of pity.
