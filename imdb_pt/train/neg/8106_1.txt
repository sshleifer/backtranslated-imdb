Seriously, why do American actors and freaks who pretend to be Czech need to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I'm a man, so I liked free nudity - but a soft porn movie would have more than that, and at least it would not pretend to be artistic. <br /> <br /> All the political statements where painfully didactic- the director heard of subtlety? The performance was also leafy and melodramatic, and comic relief was never funny. The characters were very superficial, and I just could not identify with them. <br /> <br /> The part that I laughed at was when they cut the actors into archive footage of the demonstrations in Prague - and they were black and white and then sepia to match the images - just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I have read many of Kundera's short stories (and not the Unbearable Lightness of Being), and there are good things about his writing style (although his themes are a great male fantasy) - and I have to say that The film did NOT convey anything of the kindness of the Kunderas style.
