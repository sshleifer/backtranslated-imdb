From the creators of Shrek ???????? .. OK, that caught my eye. <br /> <br /> Well, the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half the size of Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Flushed Away is as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> That means that Flushed Away is not good. The animation and all the special effects were extremely good, but the movie was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was only for children. It is not really possible for adults to really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were lots of jokes meant for adults. I bet kids understand the jokes. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm completely disappointed. 4/10
