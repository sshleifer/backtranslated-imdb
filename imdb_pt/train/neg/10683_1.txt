A guy is hit. Right in the eye, this other guy shoots him. He has some bodyguards and they kill the killer, but a reporter gets interested. She goes to the hospital, where they took the guy who was killed. She walks in and corners a bodyguard, but he does not feel like talking. I can not figure out why. It's not like somebody's interested. She's the only reporter there. Anyway, your editor discourages her from working on this stupid story. But hey, she does anyway. She's going to see the killer's sister and mother. A few minutes after she leaves, they are beaten - someone blows up the trailer - a huge fireball. Then she looks for the hospital bodyguard. She finds him hungover on the boat, but a minute later, they are both under water sucking a dive tank because three guys are trying to hit them (and they blew up the boat a long time - big fireball). The reporter and bodyguard hit two of the guys who are trying to hit them. Over the course of the next hour, another guy is hit across the street, there is a shooting with several corpses in a warehouse, some car chases with wreckage and death, a fake suicide, and so on. stiffs, all kinds of carnage. <br /> <br /> Big deal, but what the reporter and the bodyguard can not figure out is: why the hell did the original guy get hit? What is the motivation? Of course, this can help us figure out why the reporter is interested. Through almost all of this she is the only reporter in the story. No one else in the media cares. Not even with all the big fireballs and corpses. It's true that the original guy who was hit was not exactly a celebrity. His work was a little boring. He was just the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent. <br /> <br /> Is it the spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no TV cameras, no other print reporters, no bloggers ... just one more of these police crimes ... So, what's the spoiler? <br /> <br /> Let me think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The spoiler is that your wife did it! Yes, the first lady. She was kidding because the president was joking. And she runs away from it. She's very sharp, right? But how the hell could anyone figure it out? Why would anyone bother? After all, only one reporter is interested. <br /> <br /> I give this move a "1". It was so stupid that I just had to keep watching. And it just got dumber! This is the real spoiler! But even if I say so, you have to see it to believe it!
