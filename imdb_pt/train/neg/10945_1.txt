Words can not simply describe how horrible this movie is. I watched video last night, and I just could not believe what I was seeing. Basically, "Snakeeater" is about an ex-military (Lorenzo Lamas) and his quest for his kidnapped sister who was held captive by Rednecks Liberation style. The acting, writing, directing, photography and editing of the film are deplorable, along with a song called "Soldier" which has to be one of the worst theme songs ever! <br /> <br /> However, there is a treat. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" is in the movie playing a laughable villain. Otherwise, avoid this mess at ALL COSTS.
