I do not know why I'm commenting on this stupid reality show that I watched a few episodes of (a marathon broadcast out when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something, I did not watch the whole thing though. Like three episodes) as I was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day. Maybe I'm bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Britney, I really do. For all her Money and fame , she seems to have very little sense of dignity. She is egocentric to the extreme. She married the asshole Federline (alright, anyone can make a mistake) and before that she "starred" this horrible show about her day to day with her. where he puts a video camera wherever she wants it, it does not matter if it's in someone's face or in the shower while Federline is there. She is babbling about her sex life without leaving anything to her imagination, I do not care about my part, but I can not help but wonder how she feels about it now, when she is divorced. And yes, because of her, I'm ashamed. But I should not be. She seems to live a rather shallow, shallow life. I do not want to trade lives with her, even if I could. Road killer TV if you like.
