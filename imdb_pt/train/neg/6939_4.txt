R Balki tries to tell him a story that had previously been told by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensual way. This time it is mixed with mature humors. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a Chef and owns Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his work just like any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. I still can not make Hyderabadi Biryani properly. <br /> <br /> Enter Tabu who sends you the appropriate Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and they soon starts to meet and finally fall in love with each other? Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 ?? No probs! But a hitch! Father of Tabu Paresh Rawal !! Couples decide to meet the father for marriage approval. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger to him. And the complications begin? Wise performance all three actors are brilliant. The script of the movie is very tight and interesting. The dialogues of the film are captivating. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not filled correctly. Comedy is sometimes not well understood. The film also tries to linger in parts. <br /> <br /> Musically, there is not much to sing except the title track. Camera work is good. Director R Balki could have done a lot better with this script. But in the second half he looks confused himself. His father's "Satyagrah" scene seemed annoying. But the speeches of Amitabh Bachchan during this scene are worthy of applause. <br /> <br /> Overall, Cheeni Kum needed to have more sugar!
