I read another review expressing the view that Platoon was an endless cycle of marines killing people, being killed, taking drugs, and talking trash. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with this because the film actually had more than that but it's a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: this did not have a real plot - that's a point which I agree. <br /> <br /> It's self-indulgent Stone at its best. He really wanted to show not only how war leads to death, but also how extremely traumatic it is for those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to "exalt" this aspect and the grand finale is simply too much champagne, eximi, Oscar hunt "let's create a lasting image" to my liking. The problem I have with Stone and other filmmakers of his laia is that they fail to understand this simple concept: portraying the terribly bloody deadly waste that the war is NOT TO PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON IF IT WAS A WAR unjust or immoral. We saw the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq. If you're losing your mind, let me tell you plainly: If you saw how World War II was really bloody and how destructive it was to the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? If this fact alone does not convince him that it was an unjust war, then why the depictions of the horrors of Vietnam would convince him that it was wrong to go to war in that case. Personally, I do not support the US decision to go to war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not subscribe to the theory that "this war is wrong because people died and suffered." I do not think motivations are always wrong by default, just because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> That does not say anything of the fact that the final or the big final "twist" was a bit stupid. However, this is not the Stones' first eccentric game. Wall Street was a magnificent movie, until the last 30 minutes, when it made a terrible "wrong turn". JFK is probably one of the few films that Stone did that ended very well. <br /> <br /> But this hardly matters in this because there was very little plot to that point of the movie to squirm. And that's why I gave such a low grade. It was practically without history and boring - unless you fell for the manufactured pungency.
