What was Steven Seagal thinking? I mean, first of all I love Seagal. I love all of his films until the mid-2000s. His first things are some of the best of the genre. This, however, does not match his excellent name. Attack Force (with the protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) would be an irrational action movie with Seagal in a typical one-line kick. However, what we have is a crime mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shadows because of his weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who turn into superhumans when they take a drug. What happened in this movie? Seagal's dubbing is a disgrace, a mess and a shame. Why dub the man? The story is terrible. This has a 2/10 of me because of the scene where Seagal asks for support, despite having an army with him, and a hilarious fighting scene where seagal shakes hands like a girl facing the camera! "Revenge is a two-way street," says Seagal in this movie ... well, forget about Steven's revenge, you need redemption!
