The fact that someone really wastes money on such a bad script is beyond me. This really should be one of the worst movies, plus "Haunted Highway" that I've seen. BAD actors and a really bad story. There are no normal reactions to any event in this movie, and even though it's Halloween, normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing the father's murder, not to mention people with duct tape covering their airways, not being able to breathe. (in a room with at least 50 people I could add) and some person dressed like Satan dragging dead people out of their home, even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one could be so naive and stupid in believing in the reality of the appearances of Satan and Jesus on the same day as this boy does. When I was 8, I certainly had more intelligence than that. <br /> <br /> But, the really stupid thing is that everyone seems to be falling in love with this dumb look like Satan too, no questions asked. The question over the course of the movie is, is it really Satan, or is it a crazy person killing people whenever he feels that way? Well, he has human hands, arms, built and anything, so I think he should be in the movie too, otherwise they did a bad job hiding it. So, with that person being human and all, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his lover, 5 (!! ???) cops (all with weapons and training, I presume), and a few other people. .... and obviously everyone was there waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen, and I would never recommend Someone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total crap.
