Ugh! Another of these DVDs "cheated by the cover". I expected some kind of action, at least with bears, cats and such on the cover. I have nothing! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I forced myself to observe this to the end thinking that eventually something would happen ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now, the reason I gave 2 is because of the scenario; otherwise, it was a drug. <br /> <br /> The boy was terrible, talking to himself (though I suppose they could not shoot a movie with stupid music and no dialogue), doing their karate poses for a tree. I touch, threatening a raccoon, chewing worms, and (what an idiot) kicking a porcupine. And he would not be pulling the feathers out so easily too ... they stick together like hooks. At least he fought the bear (weakly) a couple of times. <br /> <br /> What was happening with the flashback thing? That made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a survival movie, not some dramatic bs about a boy who suffers from the divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have had the bear eating the kid or something. At least that would have been more exciting. <br /> <br /> Guys, do not waste your time on this.
