This is one of those horrible B movies that could not have touched anywhere near a theater. The women run around dressed in half-naked bunny costumes, an extremely fat woman is the target of many nonsensical jokes, and they all work in the restaurant of a dirty old man who has an eccentric son (Jim Hanks, of course Brother of Tom), to whom the man wants to be "put". Hanks is really good, but this movie does not lead to anything and does not make sense. Do you need to know why this was done? However, because of Hank's performance and some moments of entertainment (but not more than a few), he received a stellar "2" out of 10. I think it was being cool, though.
