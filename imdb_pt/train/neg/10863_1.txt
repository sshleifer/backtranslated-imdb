LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was very good, but this really makes you not disappoint u ........................... ... ......... <br /> <br /> This movie really wastes your time and money. I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and both of them bored in the cinema-hall .......................... ... ......................... <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT was too small n useless in this movie. I think SANJAY-DUTT cut the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The character of the film is also not well define as the previous one. this movie shows u the result of ABOUT-CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> The ideas of MAHATMA are also not defined and confused ..... ......... .... REALLY VERY BIG DISAPPEARANCE
