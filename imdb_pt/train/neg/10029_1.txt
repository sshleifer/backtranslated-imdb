I had no idea what the film is before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while being promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said "it's the debut in the direction of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the scripts for Dhoom 1 & 2 and the son of Saif Ali Khan Ibrahim makes his film debut at interpret him as a child in his flashback. " <br /> <br /> After watching, I understood why their trailer was not appropriate because there was nothing in the movie to show. The story was extremely difficult and even a 10 year old can create a better story. There was almost no action and the camera swayed at every possible angle and it is difficult to figure out who is killing who. In addition, the action was silly and unrealistic, eg. 1 man with a gun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns. <br /> <br /> As I watched Tashan, I remembered 3 movies: Sin City: During opening credits <br /> <br /> Koyla: Terrible English from Anil Kapoor as Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not at all funny. <br /> <I also heard that the budget is 40 crores, the same as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went. Anyway, if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. The race was hot on the heels and that's a million times better. <br /> <br /> The only two good songs are Dil Haara and Challiya and both songs are recorded in Greece in good locations, but what is the use of this in a garbage film? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English could not save this discomfort.
