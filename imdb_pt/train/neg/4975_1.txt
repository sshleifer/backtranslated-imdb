Having seen the Canadian / Icelandic / British 2004 production of Beowulf & Grendel, which I found brilliant and impressive, I approached that - the first of Beowulf's three newest films to be released this year - with apprehension. As soon as I heard the "Viking" and saw the horned helmets, I moaned. These were the Swedes and Danes of the Migration Age, not the Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (the horns make it easier for the enemy to drop their helmet and then brain them). Then there is the Hrolfgar palace, which looks like a setting for a film about Greece or Rome, not Denmark from the sixth century. Swords and armor look like props from previous films, set in various historical periods. I saw guns that could have been used by Crusaders in "Kingdom of Heaven," and one character was wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts replica of "Beowulf & Grendel"! In addition to the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was somber and the performance totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a beast of secret weapons, complete with range of sights and explosive projectiles, which appeared to be something purchased from Iraqi insurgents. The special effects monster and his mother were so steroid that Beowulf could never have ripped off an arm like he did in the poem. Thanks to the gods for bazooka beasts! I could go on, but I will not.
