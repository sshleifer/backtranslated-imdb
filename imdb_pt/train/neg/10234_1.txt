I'll keep it short; thanks to Greg for helping me put it succinctly: The captivity is about a guy who consumes a girl's drink, imprisons her and torture her, then introduces herself as a captive to have sex with her. This is the only twist and joke in the movie. It's torture like rape on a slow date. And it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad, it's good; it's just bad. It should also be mentioned that among critics, there is a "spoiler code" that they dare not break even though some have been tempted to do so because it is so vile. Why no one had the cojones to go forward and say, "this is rubbish, and that's why", is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these poop vendors.
