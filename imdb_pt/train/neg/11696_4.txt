I started to see this movie with low expectations, in fact I only noticed because it was an adaptation of a S.K. romance (a novel I've never read). <br /> <br /> I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie was not close to good, but it keeps you interested. What really drives this story is the work done by the director and the actors. The film is too long, it has no "cool" photos and no scares, the dialogues are dumb and the special effects suck. <br /> <br /> The only good things are that, like I said, this keeps you interested (I think the book should be good) without using too many clich√©s of terror. <br /> <br /> My vote 4/10.
