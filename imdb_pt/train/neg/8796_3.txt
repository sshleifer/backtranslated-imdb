Media viewers looking for any sense of inner coherence in a movie should probably give this one a pass. It creates the same sense of looking at a curious set of individual images that seem to have some relation to each other but never merge into a totality. While this isolating approach creates a kind of cinematic montage. It may be appealing to some students or critics immersed in the inner language of contemporary cinema, it is categorically annoying and condescending to us commoners who have just fallen off the wagon. An obvious avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional mark of authors like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but to me it seems that Andy Warhol has warmed up. The only redeeming feature I encounter is in the production values, and they will not cut it all by themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Excuse. The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll as soon as their interest begins to stir. I get the same big yawn and disappointment reading what I think are very experienced and complete comments about this movie that never lead to anything truly understandable. Ideas and images without some external context are not my idea of ​​fun. Call me a Philistine wandering the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey. <br /> <br />
