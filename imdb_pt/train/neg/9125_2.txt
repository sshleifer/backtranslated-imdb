It's one of the fun things about being young is that someone can be easily fooled by advertising. I've spoken before in another movie, in which the movie commercial (comedy) makes it look funnier than it is. Seeing the ad for this one in 1981 made me think this was going to be a wildly fun movie. What my brother and I went and saw with me did not know is that the scene used in the TV ad was the last scene of the movie! <br /> <br /> As this scene is the end result of everything that came before in the movie, I can only imagine that there was nothing funnier to use! The last scene is, thanks to a young potion, Dr. Fu Manchu transforms from an old bearded man into a bright young Asian rock star / Elvis! (With singers back up no less!) <br /> <br /> Defined for no real reason in the 1930s, Peter Sellers does his best with the material at hand but he is not given any very good reason for his "comedy" moments. The rest of the actors were just boring and my brother and I sat all this time laughing at everything. It was natural for us to expect a "Pink Panther" comedy, and Peter Sellers was so good at it. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that this was his last movie before he died. His appearance on the Muppet Show was more fun than this ill-conceived failure. Still, I do not blame him. I blame everyone else involved for not trying to make a better film of it. 2 stars is being generous !!
