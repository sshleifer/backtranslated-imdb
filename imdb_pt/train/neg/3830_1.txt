I do not know why I'm taking the time to review this time wasted movie. Should you stay long enough in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or amazing? do not do He finally fails after rigid, stereotyped and predictable dialogue and acting. Internal scenes are so brightly lit that you think that if the camera were enlarged a millimeter, you would see the klieg lights. Costumes, hairstyles and scenery are starched, pressed and immaculate. Should we imagine ordinary people actually lived like this in the early 20th century in Arizona? Other comparisons of comments to Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least this director has wrought his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. The blood of the HARD MEN is a free explosion of explosions of imitation wood from bandits with well-groomed nails. There is?!? I can believe that Heston thought he might be doing something of value with this movie. (He can hold the gun with cold fingers.) But Coburn? I'll never guess why he signed up for this farce. Want to see a movie about the end of the West as we knew it, the end of the West as we knew them? Watch SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. THE LAST DENTARS MEN is a derision of an obituary to the West.
