A Remarque novel. A cast that looks great on paper. A left-wing refugee struggling to stay in Paris between wars. A Gestapo officer in disguise. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that there is no synergy here. Fragments never clump together. <br /> <br /> Stories about leftist refugees in France need not be so monotonous. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir "Scum of the Earth" (if you can find it). Or his chilling "Dialogue with Death" (idem). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interest in this movie lies in some of the incidental details. <br /> <br /> Leaders spend a lot of time drinking calvados, Norman apple brandy. I welcome any suggestion to have a pinch of calvados myself. It certainly made this movie seem to go faster. But, according to the film, it is sold only in cheap and cheap salons. Vive le tabac parisien! That's what I said. References to intoxicating liquors abound here; This seems to be a concern of the scenarists. <br /> <br /> I like movies set in France because it can be fun to wait for the inevitable full-size alcohol ad to appear on a wall in the background. I was not dissapointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film would rate a 10 if we only judged it in the refinement of its drink murals. <br /> <br /> The film's indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known - if you can call it that - for his opera "The Emperor Jones," based on O'Neill's play. It premiered about the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in one or two recordings of Lawrence Tibbett. It should come up again soon; they are running out of potentially tradable operas to revive. <br /> <br /> The Opera seems to be an appropriate subject to mention here, since Charles Boyer's character operates under his "Czech" nicknames. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both prominent roles in the German opera. Is this just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> The fall of names seems to be part of this film. Note that they call "Himmelstoss" on the phone. Himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters of Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front". <br /> <br /> Well, the inner jokes are all in place; I do not think there was time to develop any drama.
