After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. The narration describes the film as surreal. Well, there are surreal and surreal. <br /> <br /> There was really only one part of the movie that seemed surreal to me, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual images, particularly the dining room scene, where everyone is on the floor, were so absurd that they made no sense. I do not care about images that do not mean anything, but these scenes seemed irrelevant. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan's inner monologue. I do not know what else would explain what was happening. Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me any clue as to what Logan was thinking, what his perspective was, or even his emotional state. All I could say was that he was not particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he had a crush on an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much else did. Purposely, juxtaposition of ambiguous scenes with those that were more direct seemed more of an excuse than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> Still, so tiring and content-free the movie was for me, it was a definite change of pace. I really enjoyed Madagascar Skin and I had the feeling that this film aspired to this kind of narrative, and maybe even the style. He did not even come close. For me there is no doubt: this film deserves an A for effort, but a D for execution.
