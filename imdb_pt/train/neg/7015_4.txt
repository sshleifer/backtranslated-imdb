"54" is a film based on the infamous "Studio 54" of the 70's - the meeting point of the social elite and party goers. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on an actual studio employee from 1977 - 1982. The problem with the movie is that it's all glitter and style and no substance. He tries to be a really dirty and sarcastic satire like "Boogie Nights", but ends up being an inferior aspirant. Mike Myers is given the unpleasant task of playing club owner Steve Rubell. It's just a slightly comical role and if that was Myers' best attempt to get into the drama as Lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time, it's a total failure. <br /> <br /> "54" might have been insightful and interesting, but instead it's just another dumb teen movie that is not fun or even remotely engaging. See at your own risk.
