I have not watched children's movies for a few years, so I lost "Here Come the Tigers" when it first came out. (I've never even seen "Bad News Bears", though in the 1970s I worked for the guys who got funding for that movie, "Warriors", "Man Who Would Be King" and "Rocky Horror Picture Show"). I like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers even though they are in a movie that is not very good from the beginning. Just a few minutes after that movie I could not take it any more and jumped for the final credits to see if there was a young actor in that movie who had gone on to bigger and better things - at least attention to his looks would create some interest as the plot and acting did not they were doing the work. And behold, I saw the name of Wes Craven in credits as an electrician. He had already made two or three of his first shocks, but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the "Scream" movies. Maybe he ought to do a favor and help out with that picture. Most surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the cast credits as "Aesop," a crazy character in the film. F.J. Lincoln, from the '70s just a few years ago, appeared and produced adult films. He was associated with the adult parody "The Ozporns", and only that title is funnier than all the "Tigers" mood attempts combined. Let the fact that an adult actor was put into a children's film is an indication of how the people who are making this movie must have slept behind the wheel.
