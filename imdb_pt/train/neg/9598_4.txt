Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He is known around the world as a TV reporter. Less known, but equally hardworking, are her exploits as a full-time flirt. <br /> <br /> Vi "Vivre pour Vivre", dubbed in English with the title "Live for Life". Some life! Robert always seems to have at least three women in his life: a lover coming out, one on the way, and the cheated wife at home. It helps that Robert is a liar. Among his most useful lies are "I'll call you tomorrow" and "My work took longer than planned." He spends a lot of time and money on airplanes, trains and hotel rooms for his succession of connections. You want to know when this guy's gonna get caught with his pants down. <br /> <br /> Some may find your life exciting, but I thought it was tedious. His companions, including his wife, Catherine, are attractive and desirable women. But your lifestyle is so hectic and he's so misleading, you wonder if he's enjoying it all. <br /> <br /> The addition to boredom is a considerable filming that does not help the plot. There are extended sections without dialogue or dialogue only in French. We see documentaries about wars, torture and troop training interspersed with live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is the protagonist of this film. Her character was the most interesting and she played it perfectly. It was also good to see Candice Bergen early in her career. I can not find fault with Yves Montand's performance of what was basically an amoral boom. I liked some of Claude Lelouch's new techniques. In a hotel room scene, the camera revolves around the room while Robert and his mistress argue. We saw them quickly during each passage through the room. In another scene in a car sleeping on a train, Robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is downstairs. Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news, but we only hear parts of it because of the noise of the train. I also felt that his wife could not absorb every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also enjoyed the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of these scenes and those of Amsterdam was superb. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this film as part of a project in the Library of Congress. I named the project FIVE: 50 Remarkable Remarkable Films Within 50 Years. As good as I can determine, this film, like the other 49 I identified, was not aired on video, broadcast or distributed in the US since its original release. In my opinion, it is worthy of being made available again. <br /> <br />
