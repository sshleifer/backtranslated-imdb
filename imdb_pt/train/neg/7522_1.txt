Wow ... where to start ... I picked this up at Big Lots for only $ 2.99. It's three dollars I'll never see ... ever ... and for what? I'll tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring and boring talk that seemed more suited to a Lifetime movie than the horror movie advertised on the box. (That the marketing droids that designed it burn in hell for all eternity). Follow this up with a bit of cheap gore (not even good gore mind you ...) and a twist in the end that comes out of nowhere, and does not make sense. Terrible, horrible, awful ... <br /> <br /> Was there some redeeming quality? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, there were six breasts involved, but that would hardly be worth my three-dollar wasted time. Without them, this could have been on Sci-Fi in, say, two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
