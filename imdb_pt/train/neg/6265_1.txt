I'm the director's nephew. It took me years to get my hands on a copy of this movie and I can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies ever. My uncle does not even have one more copy (I asked). I look forward to bringing you a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently, the average rating of the movie is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, this should put it somewhere in the mid 30's in IMDb "bottom 100" in the However, with only 206 votes, not yet put. <br /> <br /> It's sad that the movie does not even have the respect of a title of 100. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for Christmas gifts. Best / worst present ever?
