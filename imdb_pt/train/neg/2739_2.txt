I have no idea what this was filmed, but you can definitely say they had no budget. Bad acting, horrible cinematography, lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie. WWF-style cinematography will make you cry ... where's the tripod?! The filmmakers looked up, but they missed his mark.
