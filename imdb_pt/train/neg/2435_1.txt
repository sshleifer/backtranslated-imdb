I'll warn you here: I chose to believe the reviewers who said this was not an action movie in the usual sense, but a psychological drama, so you should enjoy it on that basis and you'll be fine. <br /> <I'm here to tell you that they were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> Well, no, not quite; it's very disappointing if you're looking for an action movie, they were right about that. But it is also very unsatisfactory on all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not so bad, I suppose, not worse than normal; but what possessed them to launch Billy Zane on it? Was it some kind of death wish from the producers? A way to make their movie a guaranteed failure? In that case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they were really aiming for success, then why not pitch someone who can act? Oh, and it may as well go to a writer who knows how to write. Oh, yes, and a director who knows how to drive. As someone who has gone through this mess, believing that he would soon be redeemed, I can guarantee that this never happened. Pity, it could have been a good movie.
