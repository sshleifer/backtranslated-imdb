I read the half dozen comments from other users in this forum and it seems that opinions vary a lot. I have to agree with those who found this horrible movie. It hurts me to write this since I would have expected this would have been great, or I would not have bothered to see it the other day. I like to support indie cinema, especially if they are gay-themed, but this movie is almost too much to bear. Those who went out, as I considered doing after about three minutes, probably did not mind spending $ 11.00, or just realized that it was not going anywhere, fast, and it would not get any better. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than they are ... or that or they did not pay to get in the first place. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. He's a clumsy man. He's gay. I'm okay with that. The problem is that since the main character in a movie is bored, that does not necessarily mean that the movie about him is boring, too! There are endless scenes of this boy just lying around like a load of clothes, restoring everything you've learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc ... Nothing or nobody goes anywhere. NOBODY says anything, even remotely insightful or funny or interesting. Probably the most shocking of all is that I did not feel the least degree of empathy for Logan. This in itself is a great achievement. He did not grow, he did not change, he did not learn (there is no one to teach him anything), he DOES NOTHING, and neither does the movie! Scene after scene of the same thing does not make a movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title makes no sense at all. 1/10
