In fact, you saw when Harry met Sally, so avoid this one. This will not only make you hit your head on the table, but also because bollywood can not make a good remake; but it also bothers you with so-called funny moments in it. The charm of the movie is missing. Ranee looks terrible. Saif tries to act like he's a great actor. The plots that were taken from the original also do not seem effective. The part where they both bring their friends and they play a note, just does not look attractive. What can be more disastrous? you want to spend some money, that's what you can get. Otherwise, put a few more dollars and watch the original. It's too good to miss ..
