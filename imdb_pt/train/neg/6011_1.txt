I did not expect much from this movie, but, oh brother, what the fuck. <br /> <br /> I found this jewel in a giant box of $ 5 DVDs at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this record was, I feel stolen. The special effects had a collegial look to them, camera work marked by unsteady tripods and uneven lighting, and the performance was a perfect example of the "Christian School". One can imagine the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" of the producer after seeing the races come back - the people who financed this thing must have seriously unbiblical feelings towards the inept producer who produced this thing. Think of their anguish as they see your $ 914.86 investment increase. Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - maybe Xian filmmakers need to see GOOD movies and try to copy some of the things that make them so good. Stories and characters believable, less hysterical to wave arms and fanaticism, oh, and a story that pleases everyone - not just true believers. In other words, stop the sermon, save it to the church. Take the Omen or Profety series, for example. Great movies with attractive story lines, great cinematography and intense music. No hysterical nod. No preaching. <br /> <br /> If this movie had a laugh, it would have been MUCH better.
