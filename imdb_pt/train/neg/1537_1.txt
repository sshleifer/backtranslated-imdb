Really bad shot on video "movie" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video producers. <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a bad horror movie, at least play some blood, gore and nudity. There is some blood supplied by latex arm props purchased at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and prostitutes but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but just talking. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are no editing effects - fades, wipes, etc. From time to time a bit of black appears to separate scenes. <BR> Terrible music from Heavy Metal bands whose sites take up most of the final credits. Werewolves are represented by rubber masks attached only to the face of the "actors". They did not even bother to apply brown makeup on their necks, arms or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie. There is no reason to buy, rent or watch this movie except as an example of how not to make a video low budget.
