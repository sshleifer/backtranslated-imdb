Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a renowned actor. Just about any movie he's on is the best for that. Now ol 'George had absolutely nothing to do with this movie ... but he once said something that describes the said film to a T. <br /> <br /> I do not remember his exact words, but he basically said This great writing can save the bad acting, but the great act CAN NOT save the bad writing. Never has this little remark been truer than in "All the New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy." <br /> <br /> The cast of both tracks was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) do not just look at the parts, but do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal (mannerisms and everything). This film should remain as a lasting testimony to their talents. That said, this movie falls flat when it comes to (you guessed it) WRITING. <br /> <br /> In addition to the initial dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "in character") and a brief mistake involving a taxi, this film is an absolute task to sit on. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: A lot of time and effort has entered the plot. <br /> <br /> I do not want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the beautiful British lady. What I want is to see Stan and Ollie (or at least, their substitutes). A lot of screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or the not-too-funny side characters that said the plot revolved around. <br /> <br /> However, even if this movie had been all jokes, that would still leave us with ... <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 2: Most jokes are what I would call watery clowning. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "watery"? <br /> <br /> In the past, a character is hurt in an exaggerated way for the comic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or what about Laurel & Hardy?). In a "watery" slapstick (as I define it), a character is slightly hurt or uncomfortable, and filmmakers interpret this as a comic effect. <br /> <br /> Maybe an illustration will help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck is shot by Elmer Fudd. His account drops and he puts it back. This is a classic clown. <br /> <br /> In this "gem", Ollie accidentally collides with some people. They have turned, they tell him to be careful, and they continue on his merry way. This is not bullshit. That's not even funny. That's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes. It's as if they were the bread and butter of that movie. Writers and directors just take those boring moments and act like they're funny. Of course, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only take a break. <br /> <br /> Long story: The film simply does not work because the script does not take advantage of Pinchot's work. and Sartain's abilities to represent Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script capitalizes on plot exposure and insignificant jokes. Watching this movie is basically watching two excellent imitators who have not received any real material to work with. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but an incredible help to sleep. <br /> <br /> I say that. one to miss and stay with the real deal (as long as you stay away from "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
