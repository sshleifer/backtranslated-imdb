There's no question about who's in charge of cadet training in this movie: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in creating a new type of soldier for his cadets - the bomber. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or hostile. In fact, he even changes his view of the value of women working in the military. He is tough when he has to be, but other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he has perfected in other films. His character is the basis of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien looks natural on paper and interprets it elegantly. Two things help this film: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular ending of special effects.
