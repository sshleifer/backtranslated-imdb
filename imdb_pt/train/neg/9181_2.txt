I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my God !!! This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, all bad! <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenage cliches headed for a rave (which occurs in broad daylight) on a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan is on a mission through a forest infested with zombies. During this crusade, they are aided by a police girl and a sea captain who happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the children. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and a few other survivors. Basically, the rest of the film is a collection of misdirected action sequences, including a very long shootout outside the "house of the dead". That fight came complete with the tacky Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD videogame, and sloppy turns of dot matrix schemes. One of the character's volunteers even sacrifices himself to save others. Because? Not because he was noble and brave but because part of his face was marked by acid, a zombie spat on him after he continued to hit the creature long after it was disabled! Should I feel sorry for this guy?!? <br /> <br /> To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in watching this movie unless you want to see for yourself how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted on seeing that piece of shit could easily cover the costs of doing it. DEGREE: F
