... and Ethel Merman as well, will love their loud, bossy vocals like the evil witch Mombi, but this cartoon sequence of "The Wizard of Oz" is devoid of real imagination, substituting fancy and excitement with noisy (and cheap repeating their images as a bad music video). Little Dorothy is taken back to Oz, who has ruined herself and meets old and new friends. The inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weaker Walt Disney and the less inspired Hanna-Barbera, however many of the songs are good, particularly the sweet lament of Dorothy "It's A Lonely Land," superbly played by Liza Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, and that's why the movie is animated every time Dorothy is around. Much of it is memorable, and I'm not sure if baby boomers will get a load, since it's been out of circulation for so long. As an item of curiosity, just fair. ** in ****
