Wow, what a great premise for a movie: put around a filmmaker with block writer who decides to take tango lessons. Hey, and an even better idea gave the central role to a filmmaker interested in tango. Boy, I wish I had this talent for genius. Yes, I'm being sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that this kind of zero potential to make money movies is done. Come on, unless you're a fanatic tango fan (I admit they exist judging by the comments) or a member of Sally Potter's fan club? There's nothing in that movie that makes you rush to the movies to to see. Even if you are in tango, much of the film is taken by nonsensical scenes such as a house being renovated or a man in a wheelchair walking down the road. <br /> <br /> The revision lesson where a bankrupt Scottish writer sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but very entertaining reviews of films he has seen. Shattered in shock when Theo Robertson puts his boot on the latest Hollywood blockbusters, he cries in solidarity as he receives another rejection letter from a movie company, falls into lust while bathing and rubbing soap on his well-toned body. The REVIEW LESSON will soon reach a cinema near you if someone is stupid enough to fund the film. <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter has no kinship with Harry Potter
