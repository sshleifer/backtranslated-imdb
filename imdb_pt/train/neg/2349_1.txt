There was a great movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately that was not it. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of the actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had. The large crowd scenes of Attenborough are laughable. The Soweto massacre was not like this, three rows of children (some doing somersaults!) Marching gaily to the soldiers' guns. With Biko dead, the movie quickly falls into the farce. If the struggle against apartheid was anything, it was a Negro struggle, but somehow we should all be taken for the escape of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he was not. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in South Africa at all. The dog in Wood's family gets more lines than the black maid. As the family escaped, the women I watched watched the film - more than a dozen blacks in a big movie theater - whispered, "This is like the sound of music." She was right. Overall, this is a well-intentioned, if somewhat somewhat inept, white liberal film about a radical Negro struggle. And, indeed, South Africa needs well-intentioned white liberals, as if it needed a hole in the head.
