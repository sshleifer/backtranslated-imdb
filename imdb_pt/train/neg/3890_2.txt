A truly nasty movie. While the special effects of Rick Baker are quite impressive (if they turn the stomach), there are no other redeeming features. Like many 1970s movies, this makes you feel like you need to take a long shower and rub the slime yourself. The characters are uniformly unpleasant and the plot does not make sense.
