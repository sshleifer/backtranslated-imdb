Lindsay Anderson was a European filmmaker, while David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker made spectacular visuals. Anderson's film is more about social commentary and subtext so much that the message often ends up leading throughout the film whose main function should be to entertain the audience. <br /> <br /> What you think of the IF is summed up to what do you think of the British filmmakers. I am very of the opinion that cinema should be a universal medium (the best British film does are those who try to imitate Hollywood in my opinion), if you want to send a message try pony express, and I find the film dated, pretentious and very defined in the 1960s. 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in France. You can imagine all the French leftists worshiping this film, especially the climax. The French producers of new waves will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but a large international audience will not like it, and many will not like it intensely.
