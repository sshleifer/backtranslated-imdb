I found the glacial pace and original story out of proportion to the content. My wife slept for most of it and I did not try to wake her because I felt she was not missing out on anything. <br /> <br /> When Holmes and Watson come into the house and are potentially caught, it is not clear how they could hide all their entry and theft tools so quickly. It is also unclear how the door to the study is locked, preventing the servants from entering. <br /> <br /> What intrigued me was well at the end, when there was a flash in the eye of the broken statute. . I have no idea what this should represent.
