I've seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts at one. Many of the scenes work in a plug-and-play way, strictly inserted to fit the romantic-comic genre. Usually this is good because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge usually lies in making it unique, new and inventive. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of who the characters are, other than Sylvie Moreau (who is the true star of the movie, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional clich√© and they become nothing more than simple dolls serving the purpose of a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film can become annoying, lacks rhythm, and the editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention the overly stylized decorations, making some scenes devoid of any naturalness, or rather, making the attempt to appear naturally too obvious. Of course, along with this, you have the song sapeca which, unfortunately, often sounds incompatible. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that a movie that makes obvious allusions to Woody Allen turns out to be deceptive. . If you expect good, good-hearted romantic comedy, that's not it. Or rather, this is an unsatisfactory attempt. You will only leave the movie wondering why this movie has received so much praise when the cinema is over 100 years old and there are much better Quebec directors making better films. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is. But it is bad if you consider cinema as an art and the directors as the author.
