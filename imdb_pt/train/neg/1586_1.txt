I'm probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one on which this movie was based. After reading this great work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main goal is to survive. But he is not in an arena. He is loosed in the city and has to get away from the villains of the show (I think you would call them), who bears absolutely no resemblance to the characters in the movie. This premise built up a lot of tension and suspension and ended a lot with the climax. The film was absolute rubbish. There was no cinematic quality for that. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he screwed it all up.
