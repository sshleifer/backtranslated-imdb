I've written at least half a dozen blunt reviews of this little abysmal movie and none are published, so I must say someone on imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a bunch of tankers can resurrect a military tank that has been in the desert for more than a decade and making a fighting machine is ridiculous. So is the acting and direction. Go through it.
