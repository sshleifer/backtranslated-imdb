Carlito Way, the original is a brilliant story about a former drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so invests in a club and in business with the problem that comes with it. <br /> <br /> This movie was .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer and knew immediately that it was going to be bad. But after releasing movies in the past and finding out they were great ( Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). ... I shot him and he failed in the first five minutes ... <br /> <br /> The script is something a teenager would invent if he had five minutes to prepare ... He was weak, with weak dialogue . There seems to be an instant need for romance in a gangster movie. Then Brigante decides to hit a guy for the girl ... and she says "Yes!" And if you need to act badly just throw the racism around ... As we learned from the 'Italian mobsters' ... <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible to say the least ... I found' Hollywood Nicky ', hilarious. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hate all those musicians turning to movies. Let's admit that the only reason why P Diddy made this film was so he could play a gangster ... The actress who plays Leticia was weak, but beautiful. The sex scene was weak, but we have to see her ... which was good ... <br /> <br /> But overall I expected her to clarify how Carito ended up in prison and the love of her life ... And the killer toward the end completely added to the horrendous movie that is ... <br /> <br /> Carlito's Way: Rise to Power ..
