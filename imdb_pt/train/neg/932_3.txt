I watched this movie and hoped something would improve all the time. What is so good about a guy without emotion? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex show emotion for someone other than your child. Yes, I know that's why his son is the only one that causes him to lose his temper (if you can call it that), I get it. <br /> <br /> Characters are not developed, relationships are not given enough time to be understood. In one scene, Sarah says she's not going to fall in love, and the next time we see her, she's talking about how his death really shocked her because they were so close? Logical synapses are abundant in this film. <br /> <br /> It's like someone has seen Boogie Nights and wrote that part to imitate Little Bill. Even the scene in which he "loses his temper" is the same as when the Little Bill shoots his wife, even the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - there it was, did it - you can say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This film not only lacked emotion, lacked substance, a good script, developed characters and a plot. And I certainly miss my recommendation. A-
