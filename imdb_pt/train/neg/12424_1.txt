If you want to laugh like crazy, hire Cage. Cage is about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he is unable to defend himself, so Scott accepts him. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with gay references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love to "fight" and Scott tells Billy that he "is still sore last night," among other things. <br /> <br /> Wonderful sentences like "Shut up!" And "Ping." Pang Pong, cut the sh! T "will keep you laughing for hours.The Native American guys who should be playing with members of Mexican gangs are also top notch.As they say, it's time to party now. it could go on forever, but just watch this movie and have a laugh. It was so funny that I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
