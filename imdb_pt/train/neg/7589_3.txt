What you expect when there is no road map to start with, and therefore nothing with which the director can work. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they simply have nothing to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was very poor. And I do not know how close the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl appear out of nowhere just to show that Arturo has a good warm heart, but some stereotypes mean nothing. And he even buries Camilla in the desert, instead of bringing her back to Los Angeles for a beautiful Catholic burial, where he could at least bring flowers to her from time to time. Pathetic. And the L.A. set was graphically created ridiculously. Anything good? The window of his apartment looked real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. It's been since Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whatever it was.
