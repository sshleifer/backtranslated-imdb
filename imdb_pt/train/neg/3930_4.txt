The second Renaissance, part 1, shows how machines revolted against humans. It all starts with a single case in which the machines claim they have the right to live as well, while humans claim that a robot is something they possess and therefore can do anything with what they want. <br /> <br /> Despite being an interesting premise, the story gets really silly from then on with violent clashes between robots and humanity. Somehow, it does not seem right, as another reviewer points out, it's all a little too clever. <br /> <br /> The animatrix stories that lie near the core of the array (in particular Osiris) work for the better. As for Second Renaissance Part 1, I'd say it's too violent and silly. 4/10
