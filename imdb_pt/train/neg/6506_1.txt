Unless you are a nerd movie student who has to see everything, this movie will not only be a waste of your time and money and a big disappointment, but it will also annoy you beyond belief. <br /> <br /> be a story worth telling somewhere, but Hopkins decided to hide it and code under so many incessant chaotic layers of seemingly random audio and video microchips, making the viewer's patience run out after a very short time. Someone like Hopkins would choose a project as heavy, difficult and highly unstable as his first script, first score and third movie can be done by anyone? Perhaps he has played with it in his mind for so long to become unrecognizable as that which has become, not even to himself. The result proves that he has by no means sufficient experience or ability to achieve the desired result. Even the weirdest Carpenter and Lynch films, to name just two unconventional filmmakers, were 90 percent more coherent. fewer characters and 99% more story flow. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony pointed to the stars, but unfortunately lost for a couple of light-years. Please, stick to acting, in this department you are an unrivaled giant and no one should ask for more from you, not even yourself!
