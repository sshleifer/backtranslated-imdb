How hard is it to write a movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY hard for the writers here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays brother BIG). I must have missed this part of the story, but in reality, it really did not matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and invented; the kind of "funny notion" of scenes that are drugged too far to where any sense of comedy is lost. The director / producer tried to go "tear jerker" at the end, which would have been adequate if anything preceding that point was worth following. <br /> <br /> Ugh, big disappointment. I can see how some people might like this, since many people will pick up any junk they receive, but I would strongly encourage the wait for a DVD in this. Not worth the $ 23,978 needed to take your family to the movies nowadays.
