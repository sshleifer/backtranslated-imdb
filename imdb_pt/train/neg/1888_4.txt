This film reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)," another art film with a violent and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's just special. I also remember "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where a flock of low-class figures are residents of a camp at sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match. I also thought about the books of the French writer Emile Zola, who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I do not like the people in it either. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One can ask the question why they live, they all seem to be on this planet, a member of a great farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: Hell is in this world.
