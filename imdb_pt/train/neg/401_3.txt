That's what I've seen myself saying, time after time, in the remarkably inept third act of that excuse for a movie. First of all, the effects of the computer are absolutely mind-boggling! Computer experts really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the movie, however ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters acts in a realistic way, especially in the third despicable act (I promise I will not give up, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). Many laughs in the film come out unintentionally, as when they try to explain that the eyelids of an invisible man do not work. Please give viewers more credit than that! <br /> <br /> Some sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? Nobody could get you! These issues were dealt with much more intelligently in the classic The Invisible Man of 1933. There is a scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous, and is not mentioned later. If more attention had been given, the mad scientist of Kevin Bacon might have made a little more sense. <br /> <br /> The film would be much more successful as pornography, since the premise could be realized in a unique and interesting way. But this work ... will see something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
