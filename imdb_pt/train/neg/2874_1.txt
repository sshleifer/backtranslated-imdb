This movie starts off quite ruthlessly with a woman being tied up and psychologically tortured. There is full male nudity complete, parts of dead animals, dogs licking their nipples, the female losing control of her bladder. All filmed in a cool gray color. Effective, but a little too much. Then we come to see the youth of the killer BTK, as well as the present and his crime story. The tension is totally psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them last for a long time and it is scary. Here we do not see fancy or good images, it looks like it was filmed with your home camera. It does not look awful, but to some extent to see a criminal engaging his victims for quite a while before killing them is quite unusual and creepy. What this film does not have is a drama, in fact. There are police scenes from time to time, but there is no excitement in finding the killer. There is not much of an arch for this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is full of real images of slaughterers. It is scattered throughout the film and comes up again and again. Sometimes you do not know you're coming and you do not have enough time to look away. And this I have to reject. I'm all for low budget horror movies, but I can not tolerate animal suffering. It was unnecessary, excessive and comes without warning. I'm glad that Lionsgate releases things that no one else does, but they should have passed this movie or edited the animal. Stay away from that garbage.
