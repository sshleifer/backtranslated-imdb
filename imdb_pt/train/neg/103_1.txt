Not to be a spoiler, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most boring movies and cliches I've ever seen - this being one of them, and Camp Blood being another. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the print is shoddy, and everything about this movie screams "seriously, you could do better." Maybe this is a challenge for everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie-related crap? <br /> <br /> I bought this for Â£ 1 but remember, you can not put a price in 71 minutes of your life. You would do well to avoid this turkey, even at the banana price.
