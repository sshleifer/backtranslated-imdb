Yes, this is one of those movies, so terrible, so tasteless, so banal, that you will not be able to stop laughing. I watched comedies, good comedies and laughs less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other reviews give the idea well enough. The characters are so unpleasant that you applaud the rats, the effects are so poorly made that you wonder who the elementary school art class was, acting - oh, acting - talks about a tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses . <br /> But the mouse, yes, the big mouse. Because we could not see the mouse until the end, instead it surprised me. Often the 'big' is not shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects consume a lot of money. I suppose, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed like a marmot with third world dentistry. <br /> <br /> The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After discovering that the rats could not stand loud noises (poor performance migraines?), The main guy triggered a fire alarm to send the mice into a frenzy. If you always want to see a pair of waltzing rats while blood gushes out of your heads like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you need to rent and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for over 99 Â¢, okay?
