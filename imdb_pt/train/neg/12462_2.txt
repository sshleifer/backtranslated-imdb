I saw this movie last night after a lot of good reviews from various sources. I'd like to point out that if you're not ready to try to continually find out who's who and what that means, you're going to hate that movie. <br /> <br /> I'm still struggling to understand the roles of the actors. In this movie, the movie jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathize with any of the roles. <br /> <br /> For political enthusiasts and those interested in corruption in other governments of the world out there, this movie is probably very good, but for the average movie watcher this movie is strange, very annoying in some places and you will leave the cinema confused and angry that you paid the entrance fee. <br /> <br /> See if you're ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or interest of the policy you. I do not see if you really like watching movies.
