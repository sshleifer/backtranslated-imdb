Horror / Sci-Fi which is interesting as it is laughable. F / X very good ... for what you can see. A made for TV thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a bright but misguided scientist who commits stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. The horrible results give rise to a hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment. Of course, after laughing and stammering in fear ... Coombs creation, by the way is his own son fused with a hammer, is released to hunt down one by one the colleagues of his father. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
