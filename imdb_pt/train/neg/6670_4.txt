This movie had a great start. It had the potential to turn into a romantic love story with a cinematography that recorded the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not have to be anything more than that, and for a moment I was excited that someone was finally making a beautiful movie by itself, another timeless classic, a modern myth, perhaps. Why, oh, why, then ruin everything in between making the main character (Norton) another psychopath? Maybe I'm missing the point, but do we really need another movie about psychopaths? Or is this need in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the film industry? For a moment, I was going to make a mental note of the director's name; now I feel indifferent. At least it should be added in the defense of the film that all actors seemed to invest in their roles. In addition, Evan Rachel Wood is really lovely to see and a good actress with a lot of potential.
