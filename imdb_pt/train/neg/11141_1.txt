Dude, this movie sucked a lot! I could not even see the hole thing (my girlfriend did though). Really bad acting, computer animations so bad you just laughed (woman for werewolf), strange clips, the list goes on and on. Do not know if it's just me or this movie reminds you of a porn movie? And I do not want to tell all naked girls ... It's something about light or something ... This could become a classic just because of bad acting and all naked women, but not because it's a good original white film turnaround in history. My final words are: I do not see it! Not worth the time. If you want to see, because the nudity has much better to see!
