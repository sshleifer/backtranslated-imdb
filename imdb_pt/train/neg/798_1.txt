OK, the movie is good but I give 1 because the idea of ​​a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale. That kind of crap only adds to the paranoid delusions of that baffling idiot that a computer virus is just like an organic virus. First of all, strings of code and tens of 1s and 0s add up to the computer virus. An organic virus is much more complex, although it is much smaller. However, it is considered to be one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic viruses attach to cells and bind to RNA, and then change their own RNA code. Explain to me how something like this could be processed from a monitor? Maybe the radiation has any effect on the user's cornea that turns their eyes on these viruses? I could see that, but obviously the writer did not think about it.
