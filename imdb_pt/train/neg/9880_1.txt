I saw this movie in the first theatrical release, in a justifiably empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this is still clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch. <br /> <br /> The performance is far below the standard set by any random group of drunk high school students ripped off the street and forced to learn their lines. 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while when each scene hit new lows. But after a while, even that doubtful pleasure passed and became very sad.
