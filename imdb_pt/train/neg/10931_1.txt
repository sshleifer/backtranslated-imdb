I went to see this movie with quite low expectations, imagining that would be a good piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it was not even that. I could barely sit in the movie without wanting to leave. I went with my two children (ages 10 and 13) and even they kept asking, "How much longer?" After it lasted until the end, I wondered who would approve this script. Even the trusted Fred Willard could not save the trivial dialogue, the state jokes, and the banal plot. I suggest that anyone who wrote and directed this film (I use the term loosely) should do a screenwriting lesson online or leave their local college for a film class. At the very least, there are many books on directing, screenplay and filmmaking that would teach something about structure, plot, dialogue and rhythm.
