Closing unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating for the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it seems that director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into a big, bad, bland joke. This is not only the worst entry in the saga "Elm Street"; is also one of the most embarrassing horror films ever made and offends fans of the genre! The story is dumb, the drawings of the characters are ridiculous, the structure is all obscure and ?? Above all ?? the special and visual effects resemble those of Tom and Jerry. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger kills his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Should we be petrified when a chatterbox Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game character and pogo him around the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it seems Freddy suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. You think he'd mention it in one of his previous adventures, but no? There is only one teenager surviving in Springwood and Krueger uses it to get in touch with his long-lost daughter. Another reason why this last installment is so terrible is the completely illogical structure. The John Doe-boy is presented as the main character, but he suddenly dies and the plot continues to revolve around two adults! How about this: Freddy Krueger, who spent five full-length movies killing only teenagers, ends up being beaten by two adults wearing 3D glasses! Sort of like ruins the whole essence, is not it? As far as I'm concerned, "Nightmare on Elm Street" has always been a terribly overrated series, but so far, even the weakest entries have at least some redemptive elements. "Freddy's Dead", however, is simply unbearable and anyone should miss out on their precious time watching.
