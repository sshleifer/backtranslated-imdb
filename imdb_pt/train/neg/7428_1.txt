As usual, in IMDb, the majority vote, rather than the "weighted average," is much more indicative of the entertainment value of the movie. In this case, most give a "one." How right they are! To begin my analysis, I first admit that I am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled "Alien Intruder." This involves space and even an "alien" (I suppose), but there is no rhyme or reason (anything) for anything in the long run, at least no basis or plot resolution that I can see anywhere. /> <br /> There are some scenes that are so atrocious (regarding the lines, the timing and the way they are spoken), which far exceeds the strange feeling you have when watching really bad movies. I have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be complaining about something. The "plot" involves only one area of ​​space known as the G-Spot, sorry, make the G-Sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with some kind of alien virus ( ?). I think it's strange, since the image of normal Ariel appears as a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, we see people being shot with space weapons, falling from lofts and seemingly endless. , meaningless photos of "Where is Ariel?", "I can not find Ariel" (meaningless because most other scenes INCLUDE interaction with Ariel, anyway - whatever) on a computer monitor. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee) sits and watches every fantasy of the convicted's RV programs hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... Billy Dee Williams did some courses on "how to act in despair" before filming it. We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers over his face and looking sad. The docking scene with the nose of one ship going to the back of the other was semi-hilarious in at least, and provided a laugh, in addition to the opening scenes, where we see several photos of the ship while it is spinning in a circle, looking a lot like a Lego experiment that went awry. <br /> <br /> It seems like everyone dies in this movie, so why bother? Even the VR females are dead, as if that means anything (especially since everyone dies anyway) ... outrageous. <br /> <br /> Because of the money I keep on shopping, I will not complain about wanting my money back that I paid for the DVD of that. The dollar I saved in that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this critic's time. <br /> <br /> I will just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with much more details added, will probably be quite interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
