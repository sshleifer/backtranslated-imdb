Holy damn Almighty God. This movie was so bad, I thought I was high. In a bad way ... The character who acts is the poorest thing I've seen in a while. This movie was more like Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the film appeared to be made into a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can say there is no horse. They are running away from alien monsters, and going at the same speed as a quick run. Then switch to a distant shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And CG in general seems to be sub-par to Beyond the Mind's Eye of 1992. I mean, come on, really. It looked like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo to save the day. Worse. Movie. Ever.
