A decent sequel, but does not include the impact of the original. A murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new identities to direct his own novel CABINE BY THE LAKE. Still cruel slaughter, but the film looks very ironic. Any humor is not funny. The total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and, sometimes, Nelson is much higher than expected. This movie is about a script being rewritten before it goes to the screen ... this should have happened to this script.
