Anyone who has loved the two classic Edward Ormondroyd novels will be disappointed with this movie. All magic and romance have been modernized from their original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old woman and gets "three" in return. Three what? Not three wishes, but three rides in 1800 in a fragile elevator ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time at the Top. The second is all in good time.
