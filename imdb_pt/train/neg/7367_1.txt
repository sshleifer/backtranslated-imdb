I'm really starting to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how his movies can turn out to be bad. This particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see. My first complaint was the DVD cover where they handled your photo. and made him look slimmer and younger when in the movie he looks like crap. He has his big belly and double chin going at him and the look more miserable and bored on his face. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and took too long. The whole film was leading to the end where Seagal and his team had to face a group of people under the influence of a chemical adrenaline booster. very useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals' voice, even in the middle of a statement. The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and it was quite comical. <br /> <br /> Fight scenes in the movie were horrible. The time when Seagal foug could not even see what was happening. There were tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something. It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television. They used the way. very slow motion for the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> I believe this is the worst Seagals movie to date and I'm glad I did not buy this movie or I would be very upset since I'm a big fan of Seagal, the Aikidoist. The action star is fading fast and seems to be getting worse with each presentation.
