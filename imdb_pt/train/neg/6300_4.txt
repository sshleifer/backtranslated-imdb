it seemed like a strange combination of Withnail and me with A Room with a View ... sometimes it worked, other times it did not. tragedy they changed the name to the US release though .. Keep the Flying Apidistra is much better than the title nothing A Merry War. acting was fine, script was fine .. overall it was a mediocre movie ..
