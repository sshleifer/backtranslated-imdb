This film is another Christian propaganda film in the line of the Omega Code. Not that this is necessarily bad, but the fact that most advertising films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message you want to convey. If you like a Styrofoam portrait of life on the streets and the way the Gospel can change a life, you might enjoy this movie. I say, save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission. When will Christian directors learn that sometimes people utter profanity? It was frustrating to see criminals portrayed who can not swear (huh? Criminals say profanity?) And boring characters that I could not really identify with. Also, it would have been great if the movie had shown some T & A. Now that would be something I'd like to pay to see. Who was the head of the comic who compared this story of a movie with communion and The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
