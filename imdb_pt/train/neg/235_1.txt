The good cast can not elevate this routine tale of a secretary murdered by his married lover. In fact, there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the side of the accusation, none of these questions will be answered. This is the kind of fare that appeals to America's "He Woman, Man Hater" clubs. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be "caught" in a romance with a high profile married lawyer. Is it possible that if she had not been her boyfriend twice and had an affair with a married man, the whole nasty and sordid murderous incident might have been avoided? When you watch this, do not worry about going to the fridge, you will not miss a thing.
