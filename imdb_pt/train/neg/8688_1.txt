If the only sex you ever had was with a farm animal, then the slogan of that movie is probably still misleading. <br /> <br /> This is by far one of the most annoying movies I've ever had. Pleasure to try to watch lately. I found the DVD at my friend's house, and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. <br /> <br /> I am unable to tell any detail without ruining the movie because there are only about 5 details to it. movie. Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things in c-span only the fiction movie is 10 times less interesting than the most annoying debate in c-span. <br /> <br /> I think there's a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but I was unable to say exactly what it was after I'd ripped out my eyes and thrown them at Richard Gere.
