I was not able to decide if this movie is so bad that it's good, or, to cite Enid Coleslaw, "so bad it went from good to bad again." No matter, this forced me to look more the same as a strange colored vomit pile, and offers a number of scenes that you will not forget, even if you want. There's a despicable young man, Ray Liotta, telling the pigtailed Pia that his creative writing trophy looks like a penis. A little later, Ray again, pestering Pia, not with the trophy properly, but with a garden hose. There is a firm Chin Sink telling her domineering mother that she wants to go to bed with Ray's father, Walter. There's the actress in the graveyard singing the best sentence ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHYYYYYYY!" There's that garden hose again, while Walter shakes Pia's face and roars. "Is that more to your liking?" There is Pia and her encounter so excited by each other's closes chewing salad that they start tearing each other's clothes. There is Pia bathing, but forgetting to take off the dress. Perhaps the best of all is Pia's typewriter, but instead of keys are the talking heads of those who plagued her the most (later I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally there's Pia at "The Awards" exposing Hollywood to the sewer that is, spitting the second best line ever, "I guess I'm not the only one who ever had to fuck his way to the top." I see that I I've spent more time commenting on "The Lonely Lady" than I have in much better pictures, so I'm going to give up. Be warned, however, that once you start watching, you probably will not be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life are gone forever.
