A somber, comical serenity about a cosmetics saleswoman with strange ties to Elvis Presley, running to a sea of ​​Elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them by her own fault. Kim Basinger, a still-appealing actress of considerable merit, likes to choose quirky movies to play, but this ghastly script (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) is not in a good mood. Stereotypes and low ball gags are not to be the classic comedy, but even on a shameful and shameful level, the image is coarse and sloppy. If you watch, see if you can count how many outsides Basinger there is at the wheel of your pink Cadillac, hands always in the same position and a non-aggressive look on your face. Hopefully, she and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS of ****
