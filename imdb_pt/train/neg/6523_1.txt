PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ MY WHOLE EVALUATION. I'm not tapping into the movie itself - just the DVD versions currently available. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this movie up to two stars. I mean, how could it be a mere 1 out of 10 !? Here's how: An epic cinematic adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace," with scenes of historically accurate battles courtesy of the Red Army. and an adaptation of the extremely faithful, scene-to-scene romance would be difficult, but it's worth sitting around for seven hours-if that's what you were seeing. <br /> <br /> The problem is you can not see it. movie - anywhere, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to watch the RusCiCo DVD version - widely considered the best version available since it's cased and restores scenes that have been cut from other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But it's one of the worst movie impressions I've ever seen transferred to the DVD. The image is muddy and inconsistent, often strobing. It is almost tolerable if you increase your levels of brightness, color and image to the maximum ... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also inconsistent, loud in parts, virtually inaudible in others. <br /> <br /> And as for languages, it's a huge problem for English speakers - the dubbed option has some good actors, and some really terrible, whose performance is annoying, and parts of the movie simply are not dubbed. , returning to Russian and even to French at random. <br /> <br /> The captioning option is not much better. Captions do not appear below the image, but just above it - obscuring some of the beauty (or what's left of it) in the scenario. In addition, captions are often a poor translation (a shame, as the script has gone to great lengths to get closer to Tolstoy's actual words), and the captions also seem to simply disappear into parts. <br /> <br /> So even if you maximize color, brightness and image settings, and increase volume, and choose dubbed and dubbed English subtitles, you'll still have a movie that is boring to watch and listen to. <br /> <br /> Can content overcome this? He could have been able to do it, but at seven o'clock - who could bear it for so long? <br /> <br /> Maybe someday someone will come and restore it - and maybe then I'll see a masterpiece - but for now, I just can not give more than one star to something that I could only get for eye in the first 12% of.
