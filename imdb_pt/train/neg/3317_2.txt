I like Jane Austin's novels. I love books and movies of Pride and Prejudice and Sensibility and Sensibility, and I'm halfway to Mansfield Park. But I could not stand Emma. I gave up the book after 2 chapters, and by the end of the movie I could not care less about Emma. She did not seem to change anything. Maybe it was Paltrows acting (which is great at Se7en) or my lack of interest in the movie. Do not know. <br /> <br /> The costumes are good, but the dance was awkward compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing for Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I gave it 2 basically because Knightly is Blood beautiful, and although it is a rather uneven performance for Ewan McGregor, I enjoyed singing.
