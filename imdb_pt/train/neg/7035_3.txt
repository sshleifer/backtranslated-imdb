The extremely thin plot of satanic rituals, or some sort of nonsense, provides the justification for sticking copious amounts of sex scenes together. Vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, sadomasochism, bestiality, incest and some other forms of sexual proliferation are gaining prominence at the moment. The problem is that the plot is so monotonous that rampant sexuality gets boring after some time. Who knew that a movie with an intimate encounter between goats and girls could be so annoying? Well, now I do. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line provides T & A (both on display quite often); Female viewers get the occasional penis. My Grade: D + <br /> Region 1 DVD Extras: Trailers for "Pick Up," "Legend of Eight Samurai," "Do not Answer the Phone," " Prime Evil ", and" Sister Street Fighter "(also the same DVD holds a second feature film" Evil Eye ")
