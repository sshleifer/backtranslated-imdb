Roy Rogers stars as Jesse James and his man resembling player Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Rogers' ex-friend, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a remarkable team, as two reporters are looking for stories about the ill-fated outlaw hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, mistaken identity / representation is a plot. development, since Rogers writes a "double role." Rogers is charming as usual; but, there's nothing really elevating this your performance above normal - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is made by poor material. The best pair to watch are Storm and Paye, as reporters from the St. Louis Journal - they are the highlight of the film. The songs are fine, though poorly synchronized. Jesse James in the Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
