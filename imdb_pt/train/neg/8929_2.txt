This blend adapted from a novel by Gore Vidal (actually one of the great American writers) makes THE CHRISTIAN MAGICIAN and VALLEY OF DOLLS look like Fellini's works of art. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and she's actually not very tall) in a leading role (except KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was very good) playing the alter ego of Rex Reed (bad movie critic, not critical), just to be surrounded by drag queen (big girl) Mae West, horny John Huston, a young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (pre-Lee Majors; what a shame), and other various fluids-az√≥ides to pretend that WAY sympathizer can also things there's nothing going on for this, except clips from old movies interspersed (ie Widmark in death kiss, Lena Horne) ... just so they can continue to bleed everyone's life. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Better performance =? It's so bad, it's worth seeing!
