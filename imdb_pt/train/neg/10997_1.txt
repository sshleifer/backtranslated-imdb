First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the heck? Why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget crap on late night TV with the promise of a sick, disturbing and offensive junk that any normal real human being with a soul could not watch. <br /> <br /> What crap is funny about a dog being hurt, a grandmother tearing her head off ... a guy with his hand in pieces and two girls going to the bathroom? what the heck did this world come to make people find comedy something so completely sick? Anyone who thinks this kind of stuff is funny should not even be allowed to walk the Earth. <br /> <br /> But from what I hear it's neither offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through piles of sick junk ... and they can not even get it.
