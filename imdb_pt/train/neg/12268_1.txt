I saw about four other Japanese horror movies and they were not very impressive. However, I could feel that there was a sensible script leading the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, not at all. This is a detective trying to associate similar killings that are taking place. When he finds a suspect to question, the suspect goes mad because he still sees a ghost. Then the ghost begins to follow the detective around for a reason that is never explained and takes more than half of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh no. The film continues to shift perspectives to different characters who do not have much to do with the story. I've seen this before in other films, where it shows a different perspective. That is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, everything that is happening on the screen that is really tolerable ends quickly. For example, there are some scenes with a small instrumental score that accumulates and ... so it just cuts to another scene. I am aware that this can be a dramatic effect. This is definitely not the intention here. It's just a bad edit. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the "ghost" that just screams in a way that is not scary or unintentionally funny. It's annoying and happens a lot throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> All scares were made before better ways for you to see them coming. So after one of them, the movie is over. At that point, a wave of confusion swept the audience as I felt we all felt we had wasted our time. Someone clapped mockingly and laughter followed. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, avoid.
