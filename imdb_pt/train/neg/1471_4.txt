This kind of movie has become old hat now, has not it? The whole thing is that the nostalgia syrup has turned into some kind of feedback. It sure sounds like a good idea: a great cast, some good jokes, and some human drama about what could / might have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that unites them, as there was in "The Big Chill," one of those seminal movies that spawned movies like this. You end up wanting to see more than one or two people in particular instead of getting everyone's taste. The superficiality this creates is not only irritating, it is maddening. Below average script does not help.
