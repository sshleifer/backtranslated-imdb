This long film ends up being less about Berkowitz and its effect in NYC, but more on the cartoon painting of a certain group of Italian Americans, known locally as Guidos. The problem is that the "Guidos" are uninteresting, no matter what kind of story or scenario they are immersed in. They are already living cartoons, so Lee only amplifies them, instead of simply portraying them. <br /> <br /> Someone has a caricature made by themselves, they do not go home and say, "Hey, let's make ears and nose even bigger!" That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the film are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who wish to escape the "Guido" lifestyle. On top of that, with an uninteresting plot for the characters, especially John Leguizamo, and you'll have a good movie to fall asleep. Especially considering it's a long run time. One more strike against: For someone who claims to be a fan of the Yankees, and raised in New York, Spike Lee should know how to write Phil Rizzuto, which is spelled incorrectly in the final credits.
