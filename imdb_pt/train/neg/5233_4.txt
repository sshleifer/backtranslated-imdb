Quite horrible, but watchable and fun. It's the same old story (if you lived in the 80's). Vietnam veterans fight together as friends against injustice in the United States. A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time passes, the soldiers go home and, years later, a friend is in trouble. No, wait - actually, the friend is dead and his father is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an over-horrifying (super spiky) meat-tender while trying to defend his father's little shop from the local "protection" gang, despite being locked in the wheelchair because of the war. Desperate for help, his father speaks to Sarge, the leader of Joey's former Vietnam unit, when Sarge appears for the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the rattling wheel picks up the grease, and the old gang squats. to town. You can imagine most of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that got me crazy is that Sarge keeps arguing about planning with his men and about how good they really are at what they do. when they plan ahead. But Joey would not have been put in a wheelchair by a shot in Vietnam if the unit was not joking! So when things are going really well in the city while they fight gangs, they do it again. For no reason, they completely ignore their plan and try to preach the gang without everyone being present. Phh !!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Nonsense! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment when all members present at the unit try to experience the heroine they pull from the gang to make sure it is real. Each one of them. Hmm ... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Keep watching, I guess. The movie is not very horrible to watch, but it's a provocation. There are all these climatic moments when nothing really ends up happening. The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie - the explosives in Vietnam, Joey's deadly battle, and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy aside (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I think my main beef with this movie is that I feel disappointed in that. Even the confusing subplots with "mystery helpers" and their bizarre cross-purpose motives were not enough to save him in the end. But someday maybe everything will work out and they will follow up. Ha ha ha ha !!!
