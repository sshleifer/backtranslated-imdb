I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and I ordered the Amazon.UK movie just to be able to see it without waiting forever for it to arrive in the US. I really should have saved my money. What about Anne running after Wentworth? The main point of Anne Elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? Her speech was not normal, nor was she walking normally. There was no chemistry between the two main characters that made all of their "romance" completely unbelievable. In the final scene, they even have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress that Amanda Root wore during the scene of the letter. The same clothes do not make the same movie. In my opinion, they did not watch the 1995 version, which despite having its flaws, was very close to the book. The book, I do not even think they read. This is like a Cliff's Notes Persuasion movie. Hit all the high points without explaining anything.
