"Algie, the Miner" is a bad and bland comedy. The timing of the slapstick is completely wrong. This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they are funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is a must see for movie fans, mainly because it is one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. Algie's main character is an effeminate guy, acting very much like the stereotypical "pansy" common in many old films. The film has the common homophobic attitude of the time. "Algie, the Miner" is quite awful, but fascinating from the historical point of view. (3/10)
