Honestly, I can not understand why this movie is so good here, or why Bakshi himself thought it was his best film. I am a big fan of Bakshi's previous work - particularly 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but frankly 'Wizards' (1977) was the last good film he ever made. After that, he turned to the mainstream, starting with the diabolical "Lord of the Rings" and then knuckling down with sword and witchcraft Frank Frazetta, to "Fire and Ice." <br /> <br /> What can I say? The story is childish, the animation is TV quality - I insist that it is considerably worse than that of its 70s - and while 'Wizards' had real imagination, strangeness, a beautiful background art and an adult sensibility,' Fire and Ice 'is designed only for boys of 14 years of age, and has the intellectual influence of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you liked the Gor books, you might like this. In my opinion, however, this was just another speck in quality after the "Wizards", of which Bakshi never recovered (despite having done some decent things on TV recently) out of 10
