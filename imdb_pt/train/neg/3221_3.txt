I watched it in the tube last night. The actor's involvement first caught my eye. The first scenes were of attention. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I felt that the last third of the film diverged. If it had not been for the first part of the movie, I would have stopped watching. I kept watching, wanting how it came together. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I feel like this never happened. I particularly did not like the length of time that several of the characters were speaking Yiddish (?). Was that the other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend? I do not think so. As other reviewers mention a lot of slang is dated (60's jive) but it was not too disturbing. The end is totally over with me.
