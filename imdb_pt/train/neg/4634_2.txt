obviously has some talent connected, Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a sad time, portraying each character as someone to be hated and exploited so that someone could make a movie from an "interesting" story. Well, I hope they have come out of their systems. unfortunately for the public, there is no insight, sensitivity, context and really there is no humanity. which would be great except he has no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to say about the story he's trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit and watch, you do not care, so what? 99% of the time, the words "based on a true story" constitute an unintended warning to the public. It means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they have heard somewhere, so they simply throw them on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do anything . of work. I hope they had a lot of fun doing this movie. stinks on ice.
