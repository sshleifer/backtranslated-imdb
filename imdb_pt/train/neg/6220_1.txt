This movie was a real disappointment for me. I've been a Gram Parsons fan for a long time, and when I found out they were making a movie about him, I got out a lot, I shot VHS when he left and I was disgusted by what I saw. movie was not about his life, it was about the aftermath of his death. I thought it would be a movie about Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a movie about his death. I'm tired of hearing about your deaths in books and movies, I wanted a movie about your life, not your infamous death. I was very disappointed. I wish people would look at his life more than his death. The only good thing about this movie was its soundtrack. This movie is a disappointment to any Gram Parsons fan.
