Steve Martin should give up trying to make remakes of classic comedy. It absolutely does not fit into that part. Like the pitiful remake of Out Of Towners, this movie falls flat on the floor. As someone never thought that Steve Martin could get close to the wonderful performance of Jack Lemmon is beyond me and the same is true for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played Bilko's part better. Martin is great at making his own original characters, but fails to try to recreate other people's classic work. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of credits when the movie ends. The line "Producers recognize with gratitude the total lack of cooperation of the United States Army" was just the only line that really made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get the original episodes of Show Phil Silvers. These are guaranteed to make you laugh, as opposed to this mistake that should never have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the classic Lemmon mentioned above and the remake of Psycho. None of them should have happened.
