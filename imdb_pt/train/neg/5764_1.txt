The scary movie 3 is so hard to put into words. That makes movies like Malibu's most sought-after look like Oscar material, let's just say that. <br /> <br /> Scary's original film was a lot of fun, one of the best films of the 1990s, coming from a great team that before world with not being a threat to the south-central while drinking its juice in the hood . But what the hell happened? After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2, I thought the cast and crew changed, but it's even worse. Within 20min I smiled twice. Not a laugh, the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously not a factor. The fact that at this point in writing, most people on this site voted that 10/10 made me feel physically ill. When there are great movies like School of Rock, which actually has jokes that are * choked * funny, anyone wasting their money on a gut like that needs to have their head examined. <br /> <br /> No star / ****
