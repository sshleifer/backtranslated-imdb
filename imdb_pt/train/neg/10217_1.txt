A dramatic comedy of two misinterpreted characters abruptly turns into a non-horrible-for-the-Indian polemics with lousy special effects, abusive nudity and ugly violence. It is as sincere as the handshake of a politician, as obvious as the speech of a car salesman, one of the worst films in the history of the universe. Absolute and total dreck.
