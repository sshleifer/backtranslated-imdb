This may be a bit hard for me saying this, but unfortunately so far in your driving career is true. Just take a look at what he's done so far. They barely get past the 3 star brand. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was excellent in this film, her performance carries the entire film. I hope she gets a "blockbuster" and invades the biggest league of actors, she clearly has the skills. Greg was not as impressive, typical acting style on TV. <br /> <br /> The movie is strangely classified as a horror. The only "horror" is short flashbacks, and last at most 2-5 seconds with a little blood in them. I would personally call it one more "drama / suspense". <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting the story really is, bad direction, editing and acting (Lucy's appart) destroy it. You do not have a real connection with the actors, which is very important in a story like this. You just sit around watching without feeling anything. It's like watching a bad TV show ... actually I think the TV soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this movie ... or better yet, stay away from anything that is Michael. Hurst is involved with.
