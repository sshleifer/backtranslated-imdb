There are no spoilers here ... Because there is no plot to ruin. Madchen Amick is living proof that a face can make a living - it does not take talent. The only bright spot are some really good one-liners delivered nicely by Alice Krige, but again she is Alice Krige. His soft, dreamy voice gives the only clue as to how seductively dangerous these strange creatures can be. She's incredibly creepy in this unbelievable plot. How they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery. The writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script. It has great problems of continuity, superficial stereotyped characters, writing terror formulas and simply makes no sense at all. Creatures, while they have legal abilities like "darkening", the question of where they come from and what they are is never much explored. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this.
