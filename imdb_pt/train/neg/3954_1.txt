The entire movie is flashbacks from Boogeyman's first movie, as well as, inexplicably, scenes from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love Brainwaves film. It is framed with some more current scenes (from the early 90s, anyway) that are boring, poorly performed and filmed cheaply. Not only is the film almost completely flashbacks, they REPEAT the same flashbacks throughout the movie. Then you see the recycled images over and over, as if you had not seen them. As if the originals were not bad enough. I've never seen a movie so padded ... Someone was milking the last dollar of those movies. Total Ripoff. And talk about stuffing ... why do I have to write 10 lines about this crap? If I can convey that it's rubbish on 2 lines, that should be enough.
