This movie is terrible. Each line is stolen from 8MM (the version dubbed in Italian, at least). If you like rubbish ... real rubbish, try it; but beware: this is not the kind of movie "so bad it's good". On your cheap, it may actually look like a porn, but believe me, if you're looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go find something else in the store! I'm telling you this, because the shooting, the plot, the plot, the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing dialogues (the only good lines, as I said before, are the ones they stole from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) They'll leave you in tears. a few minutes and the "happy ending" is absolutely revolting! I will give a star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after monologue "the eyes of the victim" (stolen from 8MM as well) and a half for sexy bodies of mother and daughter (who could not keep me completely awake while I watched that turkey, anyway!)
