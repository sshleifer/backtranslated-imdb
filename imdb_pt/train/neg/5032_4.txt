This movie was in a pack of 50 sci-fi, a friend of mine gave it to me for Christmas. It's a lot like the first Gozilla movie and, like that movie, it has scenes with American actors inserted for no real reason. One interesting thing about the scenes involved is that there is a Cold War tension portrayed between America and Russia. As in Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and attacks around the world, paying close attention in Tokyo because no big monsters movie is complete unless Tokyo hits it. All in all, this is a movie as well. Some of the scenes involving Gamera, particularly the scenes in Toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were quite decent at the time. If you like movies of giant Japanese monsters, you will really enjoy it. I gave him 4 out of 10. If this was the unedited Japanese version I watched, I probably would have gotten a 5.
