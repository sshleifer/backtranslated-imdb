Animal Farm (1954) was a great read on the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or dominate with iron hand and empty head. Unfortunately this movie does not portray any of these. What we show is a propaganda piece with many fingers swaying and pointing. The animation and direction were good considering the budget and the time period, but the very essence of George Orwell's novel is profoundly absent. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are only interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novelette then by all means watch. I just thought this one is a little mediocre. Just a man's opinion however. <br /> <br /> The remake is a notch below, but not much.
