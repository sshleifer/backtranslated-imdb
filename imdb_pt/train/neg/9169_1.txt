It's very bad. The only redeeming quality halfway are the effects of the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. The acting is horrible, save Kirk. The story is as holey as the grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game alone kills the movie if it were not a corpse. So, after all, it's a waste of your life. I would have given a zero to this if it was an option on the rating scale.
