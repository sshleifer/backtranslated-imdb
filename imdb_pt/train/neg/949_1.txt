I never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are trivial and uninspiring, dialogue is weak, jokes are not funny and it is painful to try to go through half an episode. In addition, the link between this show and the 70's is extremely tenuous, as well as the style of dress, scenery and background used for the show - it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old and grace than the modern series. He dressed to portray a show twenty years ago, hoping he would win some nostalgic spectators or something. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" employ the same technique much more effectively and are really a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible and pathetic excuse for a show
