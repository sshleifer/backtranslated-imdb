There seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie, but no one with the vision to criticize its methodology, which is extremely flawed. He simply continues to propagate the analysis of the journalistic style, which is that it throws away the public's lack of knowledge and prejudices in order to evoke an emotional critique and negative diatribe explosion. <br /> <br /> Journalism 101: tell the viewer some fact just to predispose them to draw predictable conclusions. for example, the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, looting, etc., were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of the government infrastructure after Hussein's death: were not they all symptomatic of a culture that had already been destitute? doctrinal struggles as symptomatic of these veins of Islam itself, rather than a failure in the police force to restrain and protect? would prefer the US to declare martial law? I'm sure the papers here would have exploded with accusations of a police state and a fascist force. <br /> <br /> In addition to the film's analytical idiocy, it takes some minor activities and leaves the rest out saying "so-and-so has refused to be interviewed ...", however, the questions they would have asked, no doubt, have already been answered by the hundreds of inquisitions that these individuals have already received. you, as vice president, would deign to be interviewed for the first time by a writer / producer who was certainly already thrilled to distort your words. they could not put Condi tape to really show their opinion and answer a bit of the logistics of the questions, maybe they've never seen her listen. <br /> <br /> This is far from being a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there. This is another biased and asymmetrical approach of journalists - who are, in general, unthinking herds. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to comment on the war should at least have based their ideas on something a little more reliable than NBC coverage. and CNN commentary. These interpretations are similar to the same vitriol that simply creates an extra bipartisanism of those who want to think and of those who want to be informed by the media about what to think.
