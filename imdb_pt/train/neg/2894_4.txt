I admit that the problem I have with the much-celebrated Ealing films I've seen so far can be mine. To my liking, either they are black and funny, or as light to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories. This is an important way of saying that I wanted to like "The Man in the White Suit," but I found myself struggling to sit in the short time. <br /> <br /> Textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) may be tame, but he is stubbornly committed to progressing in the form of his attempts to invent a fabric that can not be broken or soiled. Using a factory laboratory for his latest experiment, he leans against material and human limitations - the latter being the ignorant mill chiefs who do not understand what he is doing, then they find out and become even more committed to stopping him. "These are small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress," complains Sidney, practicing in the mirror what he strives to tell Man. One problem with "The Man in the White Suit" is that Sidney's vision of progress is also very mean, even more than that of bosses or workers who also resent their work. My problem is more elementary: for a comedy, "White Suit" is not funny. It's a rather serious script that often tries to undermine its fragile attempts at humor from spit-taking, double-tapping, triple-shot, and silly outings. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine. Sidney struggles, going "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" endlessly and seeking strange looks from all visitors until Sidney extracts her miracle or explodes trying. Like any other whimsical humor that works decently in this movie, it bends over for a long time. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the Guinness less affected in a movie, even though it looks incredibly young and serious (though in fact in its 30s). He looks so bloodless, even more so than the wax-faced general he played in "Doctor Jivago." He is the same cold fish, ignoring the sad affections of the mill girl who offers to give him life when he loses his job. (The hopeful life of Bertha) or the sexiest charms of the young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), her true ally in her fight against "shame and filth," as she puts it, making those words sound as unbelievably sexy as only Greenwood could. <br /> <br /> Supporting players make the "White Suit" work as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger's "Bride Of Frankenstein" fame plays a singularly unpleasant captain of the industry who looks like Nosferatu and makes a laugh as a death rattle. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a medical officer in "Lawrence Of Arabia." Then there's the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera from everyone else. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are so direct that no one would think that director Alexander Mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before (his previous comedy from Ealing, "Whiskey Galore," does not reverse that impression unfortunately) . Roger MacDougall's play postulates the notion of scientific progress as a potential disaster, but does not present dull Sidney in anything but the most pleasant of lights. <br /> <br /> Ealing's comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy. However, the Ealings I have seen never seem to do this, working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies. "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick again, you will understand) are classics that way. "White Suit", on the other hand, is a meaningless rambling that collapses when it should be consistent, just like the unhappy suit.
