"The Matrix" was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually terrific, but also curiously thought provoking on its way to 'Twilight Zone'-ish. The general rule applies here and this sequel does not match your predecessor. Worse than that, it does not even compare to that. <br /> <br /> `Reloaded 'explodes on the screen in the most professional way. In the first few seconds, the first impression is generally good, since Trinity is filmed in a dream. Immediately after that, the film plunges into the nose. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, he gradually gains momentum as he enters the Matrix and Agent Smith's battle takes place. But you lose all speed when you hit the 14-minute car chase sequence and it gets even worse with the big turnaround at the end. Worst of all is the 'Zion Rave' scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it is also a pathetic excuse for pornography and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The bullet time aspect of 'The Matrix' was a nice addition, but in 'Reloaded' they use too much to make it look annoying. At first, there were interesting plot curves, but here it's very linear to be remotely interesting. The film is basically just a series of stylish amusements that stop us from realizing just how empty it really is. It works based on the incorrect principle that the bigger the better. It seems that the 'Matrix' franchise has gone down quickly to the flaw of special effects that other franchises like the 'Star Wars' saga have. <br /> <br /> The standard of performance is poor for the most part. The best character, of course, goes to "Agent Smith" by Hugo Weaving - the only one to be a little interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Oscar-nominated Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with weak dialogues. Part of Carrie Ann Moss as the action girl could have been much better by any other actress. <br /> <br /> A poor movie, played together, `The Matrix Reloaded 'is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first one will probably not flock to it. This is only for diehard fans. Even in the very subgenre of the special effects puppet movie (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.) this is still pretty bad. My ratings for this game: 4.5 / 10
