I picked up "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this is just another Visual FX calling card. The story is very bad. Bad lighting and camera work coupled with poor editing and music make the film look poor. <br /> <br /> It's really too much to ask that the FX short have better stories and have the rest the technical production is on par with the FX! You can no longer get away with cool FX in shorts, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big splash. At least that short quick, cool and it was even a little funny! None of this can be said about "Sorrows Lost".
