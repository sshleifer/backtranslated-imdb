Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients to be a cop who is his lifelong dream. But his luck changes when he has a car crash (very bad) and is found by a doctor. The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild it. After that moment, he begins to have unconscious behaviors and becomes the best cop anyone could be. By the time he realizes the changes and his animal instincts begin to take on his human side. In the meantime, he meets an adorable girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, which means he has to control himself and be civilized. I'm not much fun from Rob Schneider. Actually, this is the first movie I saw. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser (see the part of him in Ally McBean, really funny, actually). There are some good parts in the movie, like flirting with the goat. In such movies, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is good to watch as long as it's not taken very seriously. But very sad to see these films going very well at the box office. Animal is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it can not get more than *.
