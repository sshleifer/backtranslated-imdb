This sequel is a total reissue of the first film. A completely meaningless movie. Basically, he took all the singles from the first film and they remade him in Omen IV, except with a female Antichrist this time. Even ends the same way as the first! The music is very busy and interfering, and being practically a copy of Omen I, is extremely predictable. It's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly done, there are much worse movies out there, it just had absolutely no sense in being made. The Omen remake of 2006 is much worse, even more meaningless than that, so I think it has it. If someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or reamke of 2006, I think you would choose that.
