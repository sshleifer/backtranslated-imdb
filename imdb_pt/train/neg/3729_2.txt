First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old in a Christian Scholl I attended. Needless to say I was scared of me. Not because it was scary, but because content.Con ... I was 7 years old. Anyway, the cinematography was very bad and the acting was tacky. That's too bad considering I was only 7 and I remember that. The only thing that still haunts me is that terrible song "I wish we were all ready", where the chorus ends with "... you were left behind". I would not suggest seeing this one. I probably will, just for nostalgic reason. Also, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of this film, however, has to be when everyone "disappears"; empty cars hitting, lawnmowers running on their own ... very hilarious.
