This TV movie tells the story of extroverted Frannie coming back to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but not knowing about her mother's death. Her sister runs the family home, but intends to sell her and move in with her new husband. Frannie strongly opposes the idea and promises to keep the family inheritance so to speak, getting a job and maintaining responsibility. <br /> <br /> In comes the beautiful Ruben and the two soon fall in love (as you), and it is from there that I kind of lost interest. <br /> <br /> There is more in Farrah Fawcett than just blonde hair and looks, she can portray a character in an extremely convincing way when she puts her mind to it - and is certainly proven here, as well as some of her earlier efforts, such as Limits and Little Sacrifices - a great performance from the legendary Charlie's Angel. <br /> <br /> Silk Hope is the kind of movie that never teases away from your cheap and cheerful TV image, and you know there was a budget cap, but it's not the worst movie ever made. The positives are there; You just have to find them.
