To be honest, I did not watch all the original 'howls', but the scenes I saw made it obvious that the first howl was a great movie. so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made. they started with "Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf". I have this VHS movie from my uncle some time ago when he was giving a lot of old movies that he bought back when Atari was new. I just watched it last night, and it was not really bad, it was just weird. I mean, the whole thing with Sybil Danning going three-way with two of her werewolf minions was out of place and rather disturbing (but kind of hot), Christopher Lee about to stab a dead Karen as if she were a vampire, etc. This movie was really kind of like a miscellaneous of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except with werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) was saying about werewolves virtually stolen from all other vampire films. in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night must die AT NIGHT, and the ruler of the werewolves lives in TRANSYLVANIA). Not much for the acting, but the worst came from Annie McEnroe. I swear, sometime in the movie I found myself wailing for the werewolves to rip out their throats, because that damn throat always had to SAY SOMETHING. Anyway, the plot is very silly and clich√©, so there is no real point in telling you, you could just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, what really pisses me off about this movie is the fact that it is the ONLY movie of all seven sequences related in some way to the original (not counting Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so do not watch this movie. there is no real horror, almost no werewolf, and just a horrible special fx. 3/10
