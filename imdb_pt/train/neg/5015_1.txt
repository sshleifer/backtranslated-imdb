As a film critic of several Dutch sites, I have to see many films, and not all very good ones. Some movies are so bad that you will not be surprised if they are released directly on the video. With taboo, I'm surprised it's released on video. This is very low budget bad quality bad written trash. <br /> <br /> A group of young people plays a taboo game. They write their wish or act more sickly, and later people are murdered by their taboos. The point is, should we believe what we see? <br /> <br /> The movie has an interesting turnaround potential, and I will not give up here. But what could have been interesting remains stupid, poorly done and without any reason. <br /> <br /> Some of the actors have played in major titles before, so why did they sign up for it? If you see this anywhere, try to avoid it. There is no logic, there is no human sense of quality in this film.
