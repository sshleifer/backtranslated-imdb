This movie was not as complicated as I expected. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this paranoia-fest of UFO hardcore conspiracy a bit stupid. Most of the acting is mediocre, but pretty typical for 1970s-style stuff, filled with pregnant breaks. A photographer and a model witness some strange events in the woods and soon fall victim to these same things. Flying disks are seen, more people disappear - but are they the aliens or the ultra-secret group of faces of the government itself? Soon a reporter and a "ufologist" (apparently inspired by the character of the writer-director) are drawn to this revealing fiasco and become the target of the top-secret agents who are as threatening as unlikely and reckless. So the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> The film, predictably, makes as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking it so seriously. The camera work is good for a low budget movie, the pace is very good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues that are fun to watch. What are the few seconds of brightness I mentioned? Honestly, I can not tell you much without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the movie is worth at least moving fast if you can not get in the middle.
