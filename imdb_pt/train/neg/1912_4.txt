There is nothing new here. All the standard scenes of romantic comedy, even the taxi running to the airport to stop the woman from running away. The only thing that saves this is the performance of Alison Eastwood and some of the smaller characters (blink and you'll miss Gabrielle Anwar), who obviously had fun. <br /> <br /> Turn off when the pair is ecstatic, and you will not have to go through the inevitable pain of the plot.
