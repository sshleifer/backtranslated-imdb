Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and frighteningly big thumbs) who travels by car across the country, eventually finding her true place among a group of cowboys lit by peyote on a ranch dedicated to preserving the Screaming Crane; Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​her lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, with her thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire does not have a primary target and just runs the whole map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal but did not involve an audience). The notorious box office failure was not as criticized as it was ignored, and one can see why: it is a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, direction touches and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a point posing on the side of the road trying to get a ride, but that pretty much put kibosh on Phoenix's career. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write this, but maybe should) gives the safest performance as the doctor who works with one of those thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
