This movie has a very Broadway feel - the backdrop, the acting, the 'noise' - and it's still all it has. Some 'sense' of a Broadway without the bang. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, the image is disconnected, the corner appears in you, suddenly you are reminded that it is a musical. <br /> <br /> Disappointing: Sinatra <br /> <br /> Intolerable: Sinatra's fiance --- certainly, the tone and accent of his voice were unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Tolerable: Mr. "I remember the numbers in my data" <br /> <br /> Pleasure: discrete singing of Brando (very biased!) <br /> <br /> Surprise : how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in her scenes in Havana. It's the bone structure! How I would have killed seeing Miss Leigh in a role defying Brando again.
