I watched this movie. Until the end. And that was not easy at all. It's so annoying, misunderstood and in almost every detail stolen from the "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can not believe that the creators take this seriously. Even harder to believe, it's how this "product" came on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So if you want to watch a horror movie, just watch "Scream", but if you want to laugh loudly and have a good time, watching some children running through the forest shouting at each other and showing your inability to watch the dark area.
