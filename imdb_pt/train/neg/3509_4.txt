Somewhere inside this movie there's a half-hour episode of the Twilight Zone trying to get out. While Cube was tense, well-done, claustrophobic and engaging, I'm afraid that Cypher is a bloated and tedious repetition of several well-worn themes that simply do not contribute much, especially if you've seen almost anything else. decent science fiction movie halfway. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to drag all the way through his relatively short 95 minutes to the incompetent end. Neither character awakens one to the other, and for a movie made in 2002, the technology is really cheesy. It's hard to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not a good movie. <br /> <br /> When you see grass growing and painting dry and bored with your insects, then watch this movie, but the other activities are likely to be more stimulating.
