Well, here I go with another movie from industry B. It's sad enough to see some badly made movies, but I do not care if a B or C industry produces the movie. Show some effort in your work. The characters are very bad. The acting is not in question in this (surprise), but the plot is. How can a tight squad witness two of his fellow soldiers have massacred and then continue as if nothing had happened. What bothered me was how the writer even threw in the remaining limbs a scene where they joke about how cool the doctor's ass was. Give me some time.
