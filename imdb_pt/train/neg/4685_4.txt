By the last minutes of the movie, I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is so terrible and "Hollywoodized" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility of having been ordered to fire their nuclear missiles. . The captain, Gene Hackman, is all for the release, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the launch orders first. The problem is, to launch both, the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington remains firm until this eventually results in armed insurgency aboard the submarine. Eventually, the error is discovered and the missiles are not dropped. Nice. However, here comes the part that simply does not sound true. After they are back on the ground and go before a review board, Washington and Hackman (who have just spent half of the movie trying to kill themselves) shake hands and are all friends! There is?! Too banal an ending to make the movie worth it to me.
