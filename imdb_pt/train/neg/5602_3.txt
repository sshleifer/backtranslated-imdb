"Pandemonium" is a spoof of horror movies that comes out more stupid than funny. Believe me when I say I love comedies. Especially with parodies of comedy. The trilogy "Airplane", "The Naked Gun", "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that mimic a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not up there with these movies. Most of the scenes in this movie made me sit silently because the movie was not so funny. There's some laughter in the movie, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all this movie has to do. Geez, "Scream" had more laughter than this movie and it was another horror movie. How bizarre is that? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of four)
