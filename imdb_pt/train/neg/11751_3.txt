When HEY ARNOLD! first came on the air in 1996, I watched. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes began to appear again and again, so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching them. I was kind of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! The FILM since it does not seem to be as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons, such as SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. However, having nothing better to do, I went to see the movie anyway. Going to the theater, I was not expecting much. I was just hoping it was a stupid movie version of a children's drawing like the movie RECESS. I think I got what I expected. It was a silent movie and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but most of the time, the movie was bad. Simply for kids.
