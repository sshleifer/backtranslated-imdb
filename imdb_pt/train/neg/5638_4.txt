Only one thing could have redeemed that sketch. A healthy firefight between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the motel veteran who (secretly would be) secretly observing the woods and renting them aged when he shared the rubber house. <br /> <br /> In the process, they could have blown this freezing cabin into pieces, solved most of the obstacles; like the ode "bitch bitch" on the windshield, the reason why the protagonist had no "friends", in addition to explaining his coldness under pressure from a bloody plug, ceaseless phone calls. . . and that fancy little space, the green thumb and its attraction for simpler life. Very technical with the human body, however. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A little heartbeat would have been good. It was fun to see these people moving, I think, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were stiflingly stereotyped while the caretaker attended many yoga classes: An idiot, a mind, and a truck summed it all up for him . I also wanted them to have a little more luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after putting a pair of black underwear in her elegant red suitcase and the janitor only needs a cardboard box there at the motel. Trifling matters you might say. I agree, although the bites just do not fit into this urgent work. Good owl fight, and I really felt cold all the time.
