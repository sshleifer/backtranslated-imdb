From the beginning of the film, it gives the feeling that the director is trying to portray something, which I mean that instead of the story that dictates the style in which the film should be done, he went the other way, he had a type of movement he wanted to do, and wrote a story to accompany him. And he failed very badly. I think he was trying to make a stylish movie. Anyway I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. On the director's credit, he knows the media he's working with, what I'm trying to say is that I've seen the worst movies ever. Here at least the director knows how to maintain continuity in the film. And the actors also gave a decent performance.
