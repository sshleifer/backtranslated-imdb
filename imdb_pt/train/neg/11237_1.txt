I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be delighted to see my hometown in the movies. Unfortunately, that's all I have. The story covers the familiar territory (the school meeting), but the plot is complicated and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. Although the acting quality was generally good, the film's content was shocking. The sexism of the film was blatant - women apparently are not satisfied unless they are married, procreating or both (although this has been expressed as a post-feminist choice). Worse still was racism - the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home - and free cruelty (tormenting the gang nerd). We should be ashamed if these characters represented the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers were embarrassed that they had brought stereotypes so wide and cruel to the screen.
