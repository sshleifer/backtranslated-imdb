When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations ... but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... could work for a Disney movie (except for the murders), but this is not a comedy, it's a laughable masterpiece. of stupidity. The title is well chosen, except for one thing: they could add stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give 0 and a half of 5.
