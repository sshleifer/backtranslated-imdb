Oh, the movie of sex and blood. It's a shame they do not do that anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if they all come out like that, that's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The film basically consists of two adorable vampires picking up "johns" along a country road, taking them home to their castle, having crazy sex with them and then eating them (except the first victim, which they hold for no specific reason). Things get complicated when a woman campers with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she keeps seeing. It looks very ugly from here. In the end, the two vampires are in a bloodlust that is eating everything in sight and they can let their victim in captivity escape. Oops, much for this secret existence. <br /> <br /> The fact that the two vampires do not mind taking off their clothes and playing with each other is the only thing this movie has to offer. Otherwise, it's a bloody and confusing mess (why is the tomb so far from their castle?), Which can be assisted only by the minute minutes of vampire play. The only thing I took from this movie was these two valuable advice: lesbians will not kill them; will only turn them into vampires and not pick up prostitutes along a rural road; they are probably vampires. Other than that, it really was not worth my time.
