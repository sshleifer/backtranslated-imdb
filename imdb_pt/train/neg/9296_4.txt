Usually, I am a very generous critic, but in the case of this movie I have to say it was incredibly bad. I am impressed with how most of the reviews seem to be positive. <br /> <br /> There were some beautiful pictures, but it's a shame they were wasted in this sinkhole of a movie. It could have worked if "Daggers" were purely an action movie and not a novel, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between any of the couples, whatever between Mei and his men seems to be more lust than love, and most of the time the dialogue is just silly. This may just be a problem with the translation, but the frequent use of the word "flirt" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not upside down, together forever, worth dying of love; I also felt we were hit over the head with the wind metaphor. The audience gets very little about the characters they really care about and therefore very little emotional investment in the film as a whole. I was wishing a remote control to move forward, I was lying in my place ready to snore, but mostly I just shrunk a lot. <br /> <br /> Spoiler ******* ***** <br /> <br /> Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was really one of the most horrible and laughable I've ever seen. The boys are having their bachelor party, screaming, screaming and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (dagger embedded in the heart) suddenly pops out of the bush. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach its destination, even conveniently slowing down the medium screen to reach a small drop of blood. Wow cool. <br /> <br /> Well, then Mei finally dies, because she threw the dagger that was lodged in his chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds his body close, the screen is empty. Me and the people around me are laughing. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.
