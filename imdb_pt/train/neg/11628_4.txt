Wow You guys are too cool! Corny, Corny, Corny That's how I feel about this movie. It started well with a good idea, A guy (Edward Asner) escaping from prison dressed as Santa Claus, a lot of kids think he believes he is the real Santa Claus, so Fake Santa recruits the children to help him find a purse of stolen money. The film is like a Christmas version of "Sinking under the Wind". The movie starts well, but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point, in the end, become ridiculous and you just can not take this movie seriously. For example, you get the Scrooge character named Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) who is a total idiot who treats his son like a pile of crap, he treats his son so badly that he does not even buy decent clothes, the poor boy wears Jeans with holes! but a 45-second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the movie you're happy with the guy singing Christmas Carol and giving a hug to the neglected son ... yeah, that's how Corny is ... I am all by feel good movie especially during Christmas and I'm a big fan of seasonal TV movie, but this is way above the top for me, it's a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is tracing a supernatural element for the film that simply does not match the rest. Not totally bad, there are some solid performances, especially of children, but there are many better Christmas movies around.
