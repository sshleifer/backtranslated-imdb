This movie is very crazy. There is nothing good that I can say about it, other than the moral truth expressed at the climax of the film in relation to the people in the neighborhood who participate in the fight against crime. Besides all this, the film had nothing: no good plans, no good acting and no good script. I give this movie an F and a 2 to 10.
