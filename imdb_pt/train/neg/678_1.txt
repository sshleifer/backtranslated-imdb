All I can say is that I'm happy to be knitting socks while I watch the movie, or I'd be very angry at having wasted two hours of my life. The acting was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that were supposed to be serious that had my husband and me laughing loudly. I recommend this movie for people who like to make their own version of MST3K.
