This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in the movies !! I could not expect it to end. To make matters worse, a certificate of 12A is given so you will not see anyone being hit, only bodies falling to the ground, even Babban being killed was cut off !!! Many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers because I think the manufacturers knew they would fall disastrous !! Amitabhs acting was great, but the aspiring 'Basanti' and the other idiot who plays Devgan's partner can not even act. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I would not watch this for free again and I advise everyone else to read this to do exactly the same as you've already been warned!
