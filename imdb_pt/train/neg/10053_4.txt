The corpse of a girl is found stripped of all possible means of identification. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is supposed to be the body of the missing daughter of a couple. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence. All this changes when one day, many years later, she receives a call from her daughter! With the help of a former police officer and a reporter, she sets off on a journey to determine if her daughter is really alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a mess in terms of plot, moves at a painfully slow pace and is completely uncertain. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an excellent job as a desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the ending, but I'm not sure if it's worth the rest of the movie. Be careful with English subtitles on the recent release of R1 - they are not very accurate.
