You could say that the actors will make a movie, but this clearly proves that the statement is wrong. Most of the characters in this movie have nothing to hold onto. They play the role of cardboard cutouts being moved predictably and uninterestingly. The story is very simple. It could be summed up in a nutshell, but I'll hold it in case anyone wants to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to fast forward the parties where Jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater. I have to say that 70% of this movie revolves around cooking, eating or preparing to eat. Frankly, I'd rather not spend my time watching Jack chew noisily with his mouth open. Personally, I could have done without the footwear references and jokes that pepper the first half of the movie as well. Out of my own personal insanity, the film really lacked something worthwhile. There were countless scenes and pictures of cameras that seemed to be crawling. When something happens, the characters' reactions are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> It's better not to look at this.
