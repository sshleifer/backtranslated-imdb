The head of a New York family, Jane Gail (as Mary Barton), works with her younger sister, Ethel Grandin (as Loma Barton), at Smyrner's Candy Store. After Mme. Grandin is kidnapped by drug dealers in buying and selling women as prostituted slaves, Gail and her boyfriend Matt Moore (as Larry Burke) must rescue the young woman threatened by virtue. "Traffic in Souls" has a reputation that is hard to bear - it is not remarkably well done, and shows nothing very unique about having the "virtue" of a young woman threatened by sex traders. Perhaps, it can be backed up like a movie that dealt with the topic at a greater length than usual (claimed to have been ten reels, originally). The location scenes in New York are the main attraction after all these years. The panning of the prisoners behind the bars is memorable, because nothing else seems capable of making the cameras move. <br /> <br /> **** Traffic in Souls (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
