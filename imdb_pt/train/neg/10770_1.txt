It may contain possible spoilers. (Not that anything in this movie is new or even mildly surprising.) Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they've forgotten? Of course it's cheaper for them, but after a while, you do not think the overall quality and the way people think about them would fall apart. House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon passages that make absolutely no sense. Some signs of total disrespect for previous films are: Voices do not even remotely match and Iago is evil again (Since when?!) I know these movies are directed towards children, but there was a time when everyone could. Have fun with Disney movies. Even the musical number of the movie (which had been Disney's specialty for years) was horrible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone even very young. All I can is that if more movies of that caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before a small animation studio outperforms Disney in terms of overall quality.
