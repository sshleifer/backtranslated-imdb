I simply give it a three because it satisfies what my friends and I expect it to do: entertain. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie movie with Romero or Fulci, but what I rented was a laugh. <br /> <br /> Whether you are looking for a movie for fun, or a movie to make you shake your head in shame, go ahead. This is perfect for fans of the "Mystery Science Theater" junior, but the only downside is that it's so bad it makes fun of yourself. <br /> <br /> I personally find it a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title we may know, because when a movie is like that, it has its own genre.
