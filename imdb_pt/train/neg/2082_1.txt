What a waste of time and money! My husband and I saw this movie - after seeing the previous ones and thinking "it can be funny". WRONG! This movie has about 90 minutes more. The actors are stuck in a poorly written script and can not leave. The jokes are weak and tired, and even seeing Wilson's nudes can not salvage any part of this movie. Special effects ..... are not. I kind of expected to see the harness and wires holding one in their flight scenes. And when the effects apparently could not dominate the flying scenes faster than a speeding bullet or superhero fighting scenes, they covered it all with a blurred screen swirl - which hid the terrible effects just fine. Wilson's helper was a tattered excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with Uma or his co-worker. The sex scenes were not sexy and the funny scenes were not funny. I guess I just expected a lot from these actors. Neither character was really understanding, so I did not care about any of them. The only memorable presentations were the children who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. Overall, a super stinko movie - I would not even recommend it as a rental - would still be a waste of money!
