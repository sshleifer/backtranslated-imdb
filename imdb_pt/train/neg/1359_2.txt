A good cast is terribly wasted in this comedy slower than molasses and chance. Peter Ustinov struggles here to give life to something, but the result is an annoyance that loses all the right knocks that could have watched it. Regardless of the favorable comments here, this movie is horrible. Misdirected. Poorly edited. It acted badly. Badly written. You need to watch a hundred movies to come up against one so bad. <br /> <br /> The messy and torturous plot concerns Ustinov paving the way for an American insurance company to hack into his computer and steal millions of pounds sterling. . How he does this is beyond clarity and credibility (he only learns his skills on the computer apparently overnight by reading some pamphlets and tricks computer expert Robert Morley to go to South America and steal his identity). Side by side, Ustinov makes romances like the lonely Maggie Smith, who happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets an apartment in her building. She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual connotations with Bob Newhart that get nowhere, while Ustinov grabs the money little by little and tries to stay one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. So he married Smith and they flew to Brazil, which became the final staple of almost all British comedies since (Nuns on the way? A fish called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> The surprise of a end is more laughable than anything that came before. In the end, I was thinking that I should really be out of my rocking chair to stay out like this. Even a special participation of Cesar Romero did not help. One of the most dull and ill-mannered comedies I've ever seen, and certainly the worst of them. Do not waste your time. If you love it, you need to see better movies.
