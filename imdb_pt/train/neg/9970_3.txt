People who have really liked Problem Child (1990) need to have their heads examined. Who would take the idea of ​​watching a malevolent boy wreak havoc on others and consider him funny? The movie is not funny, never, not at all, starting to end. He wants to be a cartoon, but the writers do not realize that comedy is not funny when people are attacked by bears or hit by baseballs. It may be funny in cartoons, but not in a movie. <br /> <br /> The young hero of the film is Junior (Michael Oliver) who, since baby, has been placed in the front door of the adoptive parents. for adoption. Families reject him because Junior tends to give them a hard time. <br /> <br /> He is then thrown into an orphanage, where he terrorizes the nuns, and writes letters to the killer of ties (Michael Richards). He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasbeck), who are dying to have a child in order to be like any other father in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the Healy family, and "Little" Ben cares about him, despite the fact that he destroys a camp by luring a bear to the spot, or throws a cat at his father "Big" Ben (Jack Warden), a political fanatic. <br /> <br /> I think we should take care of Junior so we can cheer for him when he takes revenge on people. Her new mother, Flo, is a bitch, her grandfather is completely selfish, and a little girl - who despises foster children - is a spoiled brat. <br /> <br /> But what Junior does to get the last laugh is not funny - bad, cruel and sometimes life threatening. <br /> <br /> And what is the message of the film? That children should solve problems with violence and vandalism? That they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers? They definitely do not know what it's like to be a bad child. Junior is not one - he's just a sadist, a bit crooked. There used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat each other. Now, everyone is laughing when Junior hits the kids with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a "family comedy." Worst of all, Problem Child is rated PG. What was the MPAA's thinking when they saw this? There are a lot of swearing and petty pranks here, one might ask about the division between the PG and PG-13. <br /> <br /> Children will like this, but parents will be shocked by what is being portrayed on the screen. And for most people, Problem Child will be considered a classic of "guilty pleasure"; a movie that someone will shamefully admit to like, even if the prevailing opinion, like the most serious, is that the film sucks.
