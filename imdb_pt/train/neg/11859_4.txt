Well, you better plan to sit down in this amateurish, tasteless, boring movie about a middle-aged widowed mother who has a bit more in common with her young adult or teenage daughter than she would like. Located in Tunis, the mother plays around the apartment, gets nervous and decides, although reluctantly (she just can not help it), dress up and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, her daughter is taking dance lessons. The common denominator is a drummer from the Tunisian band. This movie is so full of filler that I watched the DVD at x2 and read the subtitles, fast forward through much of the dance very common and loooong shots to walk (they walk everywhere) and more walking and simply taking in x4 only to get though this boring, monotonous, budget-less movie that somehow attracted very good critical praise. Who knows. (W-)
