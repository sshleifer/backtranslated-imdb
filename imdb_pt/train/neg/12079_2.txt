Poor Will would be rolling in his grave if he could get this horrible adaptation of the German TV of his classic play. It is obvious that very little money was spent on this. A stage, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass as a set. The film was inappropriately dubbed English, with English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and somber feel. And where was Fonterbras in this movie? The MST3K has given this sad production the justly deserved treatment. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I wish this movie has never been in the first place.
