I'd like to say that curiosity got the better of me. If only I saw a trailer, I would be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have spared the most useless hours and forty minutes of my entire life and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it's an embarrassment to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote-controlled racing car drives through the neighborhood and even enters this house. It is even covered in clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote control can no longer transmit a signal under these circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe it. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt that the race car could have reached the street, much less a house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that criminals possess. Why in all these films are these criminals rocket scientists until they find an eight-year-old? Should the kid be the smartest person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in The Matrix. In addition, the leader lowers his true pistol and "accidentally" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove, you should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; There are other senses then the sight. The traps are also unreal; if any of them really worked, the criminals would be dead. But Hollywood wants us to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the pitfalls. Do not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they've seen a really bad movie; the film they see will look like Citizen Kane compared to this. Otherwise, skip this for the sake of your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises an issue. We all met Alex D. Linz in the movie, but did he also write?
