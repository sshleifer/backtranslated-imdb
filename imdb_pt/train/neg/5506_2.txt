We entered this movie because my husband liked the original version of "My favorite Martian". We had our 6 year old daughter with us. She wanted to get out in the middle of the movie, which was good for her parents! The parts we saw were occasionally humorous, mostly silly or coarse. I would hope that this movie could appeal to children between 9 and 12 years, if that was it. Definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I heard the original series was by far superior and if you are going to "relive the past" you will probably be disappointed.
