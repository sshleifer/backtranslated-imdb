When a comedy movie sports its wonderful soundtrack on the back cover, you know you're not dealing with a top-quality movie. I rented this movie with friends hoping to have some laughs, but overall to get the most of our laughs making fun of the movie. We could not have chosen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The movie may have been good with some changes. In the first place, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly executed and placed. The fat boy in the movie made us want to kill ourselves, bless him for experiencing the scene and the scene, but he was like a puppy begging for love. If he had been taken from the film, everything could have been bearable. There were some funny jokes, I think one was when the group of kids stole one of their parents' porn movies and ended up being gay porn. But to best summarize the comedy, I'll simply tell the opening joke to the fat kid. He wears a vomit-stained shirt and talks about not knowing when something is done. Finally, the movie's editor could have saved the movie by removing the fat kid, cutting off 20 minutes of the movie. school scenes and make an end that is more than thirty seconds of random fights. <br /> <br /> OH, BTW, there are two good elements that the movie has. Kadeem Hardison plays her role wonderfully and performs her jokes so that none is lost or underestimated. The other redeeming element of the film is the beautiful Ms. Ali Landry. Your character is ignored for most of the movie which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time even renting this. It did not appeal to me and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
