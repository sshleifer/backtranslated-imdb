Now I like science fiction drawings. However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I attended the premiere and was inevitably shocked. The characters are generic and stereotyped (do they really need to make an African-American man wear tiger-print outfits and speak with a Jamaican accent?) Why are all Asian characters vibrant with yellow and with eyes closed? big and chest and constantly complaining?) to the point where things become unreal, predictable, coarse and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy resemblances, even with stabbing, in the Astro Boy. Let me explain (dub names for the youngsters): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Moshimo / O'Shay, and so on. Brief resemblances to "My Life as a Teenage Robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon" and co. are in progress. Not to mention the abundant racial / gender stereotypes. Do not even get me started on innuendo. I'll just say they're hidden and pretty dirty. But seriously. Do not even try to see it. Especially if you like the Astro Boy.
