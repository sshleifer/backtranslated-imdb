I got this in a test triage. All I can say is: What ... the ... hell? This film is displayed as well as the Mickey Mouse reading the screenplay of "Scarface". It is bizarre as well as making the least sense; and even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so bizarre that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to "save" a crocodile that contains a CIA probe. The CIA follows Irwin to retrieve his probe, Irwin confuses them with hunters and tries to "stop" them. <br /> <br /> This is the whole story that exists; the rest is overdone Australian culture ("Didja see dat" and "Crikey!") and strangely choreographed action sequences. At one point, Irwin assembles an RV fight and knife at high speed with a CIA agent on top of her. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin makes a face on top of a trailer. Let it be your guide to this ridiculously bad movie.
