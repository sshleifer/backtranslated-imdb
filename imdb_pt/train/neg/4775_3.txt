What a complete waste of time. The film begins as a clone of the series Saw, but with an even worse performance. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely awful. The ending is ridiculous and the story does not contain twists, plot surprises and just a bad ending. I liked some of the characters and I was hoping that everything would be tied up in the end. It just does not happen. It's a total "Wrestler" ending with none of the good performances. I can not believe I spent the time watching this. It's not "fun" as some people say. A mask face kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to find out. The connection is long and he should have shot the main actress first.
