Ok, let me start by saying that none of this will be a surprise to anyone who read the other reviews. That said, MY G-D, THIS MOVIE REPRODUCED! I mean, WOW, I did not realize that it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and it still came out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie! Corman probably released this movie at some point but declined because of the poor quality of the script! The only reason this movie was made in the first place is that someone said, 'Hey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we have that has zombies in it? Resident Evil? No, someone came first. Silent Hill? No, too quiet. People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared. Hey, did not Sega have a game where people ran around shooting zombies? They're off the shelf branch, we could get this for pennies! '<br /> <br /> Basically they tried their best to make a movie that looked like the video game, even to shoot the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and biggest problem is that the original game was horrible. I mean, bad-merchandising-made-at-a-worst-game-in-two weeks-and-then-shippe-out-and- his horrid parents-to-Christmas. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The CASE was annoying. In other words, this was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The homemade version was even worse! With the homemade version, you did not even get the shotgun to hold it while you were being bored by this useless game! But I disagree. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they went so far as to actually interweave scenes of the actual gameplay during the fight scenes. THERE IS??? Did the publisher not have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was a real fight going on? Not to mention that each fight was filmed from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of effects in the Matrix style. The problem with that is that the game was a first person shooter (the player comes from the character's POV). Maybe that's why they put the graphics of the game, so you know they were referring to the game ... Okay, whatever it is ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only one thing that made this WHOLE experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theater was making fun of the movie out loud, so my sudden attacks of hysterical laughter and general disbelief were taken over as commons and would not let me kick out. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS MOVIE! Do not even deign to rent it when you go out on video in a couple of weeks. Run. Just run.
