Sometimes a film is so understandably terrible that it has a destructive effect on its morale. You really start to wonder, what does it mean for our society that the pattern is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect us to endure so many cliches and still be entertained? <br /> <br /> Of course, it's still one of the pillars of Hollywood to make ARMA the main character, plot device and source of everything. conflict and resolution in films. The character needs a weapon. Gets a weapon. You can not do this because he has a gun. Put the gun first. OH MY GOD What are we going to do? He has a gun! He nods, acting more maliciously than real humans do. He pushes someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The mark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of the police sirens. <br /> <br /> It is a real challenge to make such a tired and banal formula work again; a movie has to be very smart and well executed. This is neither. It has no life or personality, and will suck those components off of you. This will make you feel poor in living in the time and space you make. Really, who needs it? So, yeah, I'll say: I think this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Anyone who was involved in the fabrication of this submissive garbage of the soul should be publicly constrained by the disservice they have done to all of us.
