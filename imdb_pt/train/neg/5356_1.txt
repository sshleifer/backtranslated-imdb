I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. This reminds me of a C-series porn movie with one big difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> History and dialogue need a thorough review. Maybe then the bad acting was not so noticeable. At the very least, the pace should have been resumed. <br /> <br /> Although I accept that this has a low budget and the director did a good job visually, with the few resources he had, he should have spent more time in history or better yet, ask someone to write -over there. Many of the action scenes were just useless. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time.
