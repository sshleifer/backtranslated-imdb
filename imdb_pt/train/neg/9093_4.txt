I saw this movie today for the first time and I've never heard of it before, probably because of its poor message. <br /> <br /> First, the direction itself is very good, the actors played well and the CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is magnificent. But that alone does not make a movie. No story, no message behind beautiful exploited talents. <br /> <br /> Or I have to remind people, the art of a director is not only their vision, but knowing how to tell a story. And that's what's missing the entire 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a simple classification of 4.
