As an ex-diver, this was one of the worst underwater movies I've ever seen. First of all, a riot aboard any US Navy ship, particularly a Nuclear Powered Trident submarine in unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is incredible and they take it very seriously all the way from the captain to the youngest member of the crew. I could never see a ship's crew split their alliance between the captain and the executive officer. An executive officer who acted as the character played by Denzel Washington would be excused from his duties and from the Martial Court, later ruled out of the Navy. Not surprisingly, the Navy refused to send a technical advisor to help make this film. Finally, if any members of a submarine crew made the amount of noise being made on this ship, they would be severely scolded. Scuba divers learn early in their careers to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not knock and do not even speak softly and wear soft-soled shoes when they are in progress. I was amazed at how high they portrayed the crew while it was in progress. Tall music would never be tolerated. I know that portraying underwater life would not actually sell movie tickets, but that is exaggerated to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
