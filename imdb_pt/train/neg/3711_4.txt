I had not seen the movie trailer when I went to see the movie, but I based my judgments on a friend's opinions. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat. <br /> <br /> During the movie, Rock offers some funny jokes, but unfortunately the film is extremely lacking in comedy. The film seems to want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and the effort it fails. The love story in the film is direct (luckily), but it lowers the movie a lot by making Rock serious and bland. After all, the film is primarily meant to be a comedy, where laughter should be the main concern. Not much of that in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is also quite unattractive as a whole. Some parts were completely discontinuous. If the support cast was meant to be funny, they certainly did not do a good job. The heavenly couple tried to make some dry, monotonous jokes. The pair of underlings of Rock's first incarnation was also bland. If there is one thing they did right though, they made Rock seem funnier in comparison.
