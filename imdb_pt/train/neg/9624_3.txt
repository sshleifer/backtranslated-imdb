Considering the potential that this movement had, the reality was disappointing. While it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even that could not change that. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat for soft fun. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was hilarious in "There's Something About Mary". Here it looks like he's just going through the motions. If they had to raise plot points for "Friends," they should know something was wrong. Bathroom humor should have stayed in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> Watch "50 First Dates" instead.
