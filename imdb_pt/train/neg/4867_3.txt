Just what we need! Another Hollywood remake of Hollywood, with Eddie Murphy, reappeared on its second time after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we are running out of special ideas to make a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! He has some signs of hope for his pleasing and charming images of animals that can act and speak to humans. Things can only get worse, unfortunately. Bathroom jokes and sexual references instantly kill this piece of "family." Even parents and kids saw the trailer's announcement on The Family Channel, which was followed by a great anguish and disgust in the movies. It is sad to say that this is the most progressive era of the pre-millennium, but enjoy it while it lasts, because things can only get worse over time. More went wrong with the new DR. DOLITTLE It is absolutely without traces, feeling very flat. I also hate that annoying voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more talented voices than a lot of overpaid celebrities who do not want to file bankruptcy. I will have to agree with my local newspaper giving it among the five worst films of 1998. So again, the original version was not good either. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if he's not careful!
