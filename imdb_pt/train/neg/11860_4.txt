If you have not figured out what will happen in this movie in the first five minutes, give it a few more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She stayed on the shelf for a long time and she wants to explode. She has a teenage daughter who just highlights that she is not getting any younger. When she checks her daughter, she discovers a world she has never dared ... the cabaret, where she can dance in the womb in sequined clothes while the men play money with her. The film is very misogynist. It's portraying of men is bleak. Which is rather strange when Lilia bends over to play, not for money but only for hell. When she manages to awaken them, she makes her feel like a woman again. She does not want to connect with them, but she's addicted to attention. All the other dancers are mostly elderly women who look like men in the drag and realize that their time in the limelight is short-lived. Not short enough I say. She finds romance, brief as it is, with you guessed it ... There are no surprises here that we did not see coming. Although the ending is good, you realize that it could not have ended any other way. Maybe this movie is not just looking at my demographic profile
