This movie reminded me a lot about "A History of Violence," which purported to be an in-depth study of violence and violent behavior, but turned out to be just a cheap action movie disguised as a film about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and find unremitting harassment from local drunks who do nothing but stay in the pub all day and cause trouble. These men have no job? Anyway, Dustin takes everything he can and by the end of the movie he sits in his house and fights each of the attackers drunk by means as horrible as the boiling whiskey spilled on someone, feet being plucked by a shotgun and someone head being caught in a bear trap. Funny that someone needs a big bears trap in a small British town except maybe put a man's head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah, who did the "Wild Bunch" which also covered the topic of blood leaving violence where no one was spared. But it was done in style and you believed it. Straw Dogs is not believable. First of all, the location is wrong and does not work. Why put it in England? I think maybe somewhere in the city or a small town in the southern United States in the 1930s or something. Secondly, it is not from my point of view really explained clearly why these men are so quick with violence except that they may have become drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> Sam Peckinpah missed this target.
