I just rented it (yes! I paid money to see!) This movie. OMG. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another reviewer put it, Mrs. Colagrande, get out of the movies, PLEASE! Please never make or appear in another movie! You have the charisma of a melon. No, this is not fair with melon, which probably has more to do with it. She does not know how to act; it affects a look of disgust all the time (it reminded me a lot of my always upset young sisters-in-law of Europe). She is not charming; She is not beautiful. There is no real story. And the issue! There was nothing I could see! It's very bad when you're watching a movie, and just to get through it, you press "move forward" on your remote control, and still nothing happens! I mean! ..... I kept involuntarily shouting, "Cut it, cut it!" What were they thinking? Well, of course, they thought they'd make a movie together and it would be PAY to make love on the screen! Very good deal for them; Very raw business for the viewer! I think I'm going to throw up now ....
