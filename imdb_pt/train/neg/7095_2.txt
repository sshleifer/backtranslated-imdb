"Diary of Sex Addict" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsion. Probably a movie marketing scam, this movie is an elegant filming with a good cast and little else goes for it. Bottom line, "Diary ..." would make us believe that our sex-addicted character has the dumbest wife in the world, a sidebar of babes on the side that has nothing better to do than drop his panties for him to his whim, and no job, despite being a restaurateur. At best, this movie could have been a good drama. At worst, softcore cheap. "Diary ..." is nowhere else. This is for the trash. (D-)
