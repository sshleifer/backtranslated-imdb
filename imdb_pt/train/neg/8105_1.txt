Harsh, yes, but I call them as I see them. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the late 80's, and it was actually one of the most terrible and boring movies I've ever forced myself to do. clock. <br /> <br /> Yes, cinematography is beautiful. Czech configurations are truly impressive. The political background is appealing, but unlike similar "historically defined" histories (eg "Dr.Jivago" (qv)), this failed to make politics relevant to history, or even interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this movie succeeds in making even "erotic" scenes slow and slow. I'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, I started to wait for the Russians to shoot them and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I'm sure if I had read the book the story would make a little more sense. However, life is too short to spend more time on it.
