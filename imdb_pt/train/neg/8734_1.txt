Maybe I've seen a crime movie too, or maybe I do not take the right drugs. <br /> <br /> This was the most clich√©d mounted, poor plot, plot-absurd, just stupid movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> As for the direction, it seems that it took less time to show this than to put it together. <br /> <br /> In fact, it seems to make it straight to the video before it is completed. <br /> <br /> It is a terrible steal of "M" the classic film of Fritz Lang starring Peter Lorre. You'd be much better off renting it instead.
