I remembered this show when I was a kid. I could not remember much about it, just a few little things about the characters. For some reason I remembered being very intense. It was also really very early in the morning in PA. I finally, after searching the web for a long time, I found an episode. the first episode not less. Criminey! This show was so horrible. was obviously done just to show the kids who play leisure tag and have a great time. the show opens with bhodi li telling his mom "my names not Christopher, I'm bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" so we are forced to watch children playing with leisure tag on the song "foot loose". and not just a little quick, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. oh yeah, and as if I could not get worse, you can not even see the laser beams from your guns. it's like they're running for the whole song "loose foot." later, after bhodi climbs into space or wherever it may be, they have a low-quality laser fight for Phil Collins's "su-su-sudio." ah, believe me, you do not want to know the rest. What can I say ...... THE LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
