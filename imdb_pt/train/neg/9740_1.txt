Now where was I? Oh yes, "The Designed Man", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. </ p> <br /> Ooops, sorry. Yes, "the projected man". Well, it's a British science fiction movie about nothing. Some orange-headed face projects itself into a laser, receives the touch of death. Finally, it disappears, the end. In fact, the movie is not even that interesting. Dull, monotonous, starched, stiff and extremely annoying, "The Projected Man" is 77 solid minutes of nothing starring anyone. Dizzy like dishwater. Dust like doorknob. Fool like Ethan Hawke - we're talking a lot here, people! But wait, for our dull cousins ​​on the other side of the puddle, MooCow will now make a proper review for "The Man Designed": ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............ .
