The lethargic leadership destroys a story from the period that catches the eye of the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, in excellent role as a woman joining an extremist group in China in 1928, shortly before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and meets with an ex- lover who now works for Japan. All the drama and forward movement of the story is sucked into the sleepy style of director Ye Lou's direction. Characters stand staring at each other for long minutes, saying nothing, handheld cameras hold forever on faces that show endless reactions for much longer than necessary, issues repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy. We know nothing about the characters as the story begins and they receive little new information as the story progresses, just silence and static photos of non-talking lovers, who interact through silent dances but do not share an apparent emotional intimacy. A very sleep inducing film.
