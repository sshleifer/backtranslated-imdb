Really, really bad. How is such a bad movie made? I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, interesting camera work, or at least some free nudity, but I did not get anything. I had just watched Cabin Fever and I thought it was a train disaster (except for the nudity and pancakes), but it seems genius compared to this dreck. The best medical writer in the world could not have saved that stinking lot of poop. <br /> <br /> The only thing that goes into this "movie" is that it's over. <br /> <br /> I have a headache just thinking of this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I paid just $ 5 for it and will soon end up in a landfill.
