This was a horrible movie! Not for the sake of it, but for delivery. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the movie left), hoping to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw were 2 hours of brutal police oppression, without any lifting at the end. The previews and announcements made no mention of it! Also, despite everything they touched whoopi goldberg, my memory is that she is stuck and dead in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews do not say anything about it! (not that you'd expect this, but it's just another problem). If I had known how depressing this movie would be, I would never have seen it. Or at least I'd be prepared for it. This was a bait and trade ad campaign, and I will NEVER see this movie again!
