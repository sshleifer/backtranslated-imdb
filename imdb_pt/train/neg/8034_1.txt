I know slashers are always supposed to be bad, but come on, what the heck is this? It's like a bunch of 10-year-old boys who saved their lunch money and started filming this by the end of the week. <br /> <Either way, six young men all go to the same house to be killed off-screen. We have the smart, the slut, the other bitch, the black, the killer, stereotypes of that type. After someone is eaten by a Shaking the boat, everyone else is chased by a guy wearing a mask that the people of the poor box reject. There is a decent murder somewhere in between, but then back to more boredom, and especially more false threats. we really know we can not be the killer when a person is attacked because the guy loves to take his sweet time for everything. <br /> <br /> After every character you hope to die dies, the ugly standard blonde girl and her future boyfriend ends up being caught by the killer (they are pushed down and then fainted) and the killer reveals I think the screenwriters in this movie just put a blindfold and a pen and put it somewhere on the character list. The motive is just lame and I do not even remember the goddamn secret. The killer, then, naturally takes shape. a lot of time to explain everything (and then about ten extra minutes in which he cuts his own arm for some reason) and eventually is dominated by a guy with a gun.Hey, it's not fair! <br /> <br /> Really One of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. I could have more fun watching a Lindsay Lohan movie, I swear. I mean, most of the slashers of the '80s were crap too, but at least they played T & A. There's nothing to it.
