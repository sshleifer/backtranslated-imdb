The remake of H.B. The classic Halicki '70s chase movie is simply horrible. Along with Vanishing Point, Gone in 60 Seconds represent the quintessential car chase movies. The remake takes the original and stays upside down. While Halicki gave us 75% car chase and 25% drama support, at GISS 2000 we have 25% car chase and 75% drama support. Cage as super man, save your brother, kiss the girl. MTV issues, tits and butt. Save your money, rent the original. At least Halicki did not live to see his baby (he wrote, produced, directed and starred in the '74' movie) degraded in this way.
