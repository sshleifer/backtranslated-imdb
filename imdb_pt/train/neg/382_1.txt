Save Bollywood and the men's directors! <br /> <br /> Really this is the final limit on the total sacrifice made by the Indian woman !! <br /> <br /> Looking at the current state of affairs in India where wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands - the directors .. can also be called uncle scars (see movie The Lion King) came up with a very new concept on how both the maintained and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between them ... including the spermists !! <br /> <br /> Line of story: Couple - very happy - but accidentally an accident happens and the woman has a miscarriage - lost the fetus together with the ability to always become a mother! <br /> <br /> In India, laws often turn away the daughter-in-law if she does not give them an heir! So the wife hits on a grand plan - surrogate mother ... but the scientists intervened - "Of course artificial insemination" - NOT said the artist (director actually) - "Neighborhood will come to know that the daughter-in-law is so sterile they are going to the surrogate mother !! <br /> <br /> Neighbors! society !! pity the same people who watch TV day and night - watching girls between the age group from 14 to 40 ... al in bras and panties - well, these neighbors suddenly take advantage of family planning and decision making! <br /> <br /> The wife sends her husband to a beer bar where the girls dance on stage - all uneducated and illiterate - but men love women as they can satisfy their egos a lot! <br /> <br /> He hires the main dancer from the bar - asks her to carry the baby - in exchange for money - she agrees - she comes home - pregnant - wife and kept - both coexist in the same house - in the meantime the prostitute also fic her with the taste of the house l ife - very careful people around - she misses them all and cries silently !! In the meantime - nobody in the family comes to know that the real daughter-in-law is wandering around with a pillow under her petticoat !! - The mother or other elderly people never took her to check-ups - nor did they try to feel the baby's movements in the womb !!
