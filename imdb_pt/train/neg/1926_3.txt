Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last two births, I feel adequately qualified to judge this version of Dr. Seuss's classic tale, and well ... not very good. First, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV special will be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy and padded that it seems to be numbing. I will admit that there are a handful of inspired jokes, but overall the movie comes out as a calculated cash catch, at the same time as it is supposedly condemning the marketing of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top, but this is completely different from the Grinch character. As characterized by Boris Karloff, it was a slow burn; methodical and astute. There is no method for Carrey's madness, and that is just the most obvious mistake made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are totally wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins is going to have practically any role offered (as well as his compatriot Michael Caine), but this one needs to be presented in "Movies That Should Never Have Been Done". This is not a good omen for Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is preparing for this Christmas. I have the feeling that I will make the same recommendation for this, as I am with this: skip it and read the book or watch the TV special. This is two hours you can never go back.
