Do not bother yourself. A little ham can go a long way, but all we get is pure ham, particularly from Dunaway. The plot is one of those bumper cars episodes ... the vehicle jumps to another and everything changes direction again, until we're just scratching our heads wondering if there ever was a plot. Gina Phillips is really good but it is difficult to play in front of a mystified Dunaway playing Lady Macbeth lost in Marx's brother's duck soup. Oh, the Raven ... now there's an actor. And there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread, who is full of sadness and no medicines in operation. I'm one of those idiots who just have to watch a movie until the end. Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore".
