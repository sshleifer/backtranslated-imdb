One night, I waited for my friends to return to the apt and that "Gymkata" was on; I watched a lot of it. In fact, it's really hilarious and horrifying. Think of it this way - if in your work you had an idea for something so bad and went on to execute it in a way as terrible as, how long would you last exactly? Not while this movie. It's a must-see, of course.
