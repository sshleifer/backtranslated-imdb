I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978, when it came out, but in modern times it just does not hold up. The only interesting scene in the entire film is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most amazing moment in the whole movie is when his parents tear the mask to see his son killing his daughter. The film descends from there and does not take until the last fifteen minutes, but then it is too late, we, the public, lose all interest in history. There is almost no character development, and people always praise Laurie for being an exceptional heroine when there really is not much for her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone who is terrified of this movie, but if you want a great horror movie, watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween certainly is not in their ranks. I can not believe that Roger Ebert has given four stars, because there is no way this movie deserves such a high rating.
