Located in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses attempts to be a satirical look at the role of media in government. At best, this could be applied to how the US tries to control the media during the Iraq War, but ends up feeling hollow. There is never really any tension in history and acting is never very good. Worse, the direction of the film is atrocious, focusing more on strange camera angles that can not convey anything other than "it's not a strange way of holding the camera". The special effects are very bad ... at one point, the video of an explosion is displayed over the city, and is laughable at best. <br /> <br /> The movie has some bright spots ... ie ads for post-zombie services (including a recovery service and a party bus). But it's too little to make the movie worth it. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same weak production value, but there is much more intelligence, humor and talent behind it.
