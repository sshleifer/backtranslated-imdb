I had to give this movie a 1 because it's so bad, but do not make me think I did not enjoy it because I laughed and laughed and even asked a few questions. So half the time I was laughing, half the time I was saying "what the heck is going on?" or "why would anyone do that?" et cetera. I especially liked the terrible fog effects, the 80's style nudity / battle / dialogue / nudity scene, and the way the warrior's swords hit the wind when they ride their horses. And there are some low-quality model effects (these are not supposed to be real trees, are they?) And I still do not understand this guy they meet in the cave, what the hell is he? A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought of trying them out, and I basically liked the movie as people like Ed Wood movies, I have no real pleasure with what the movie should be, I look at it from my hilarious way. So do not let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie, yeah, I just liked it for other reasons. It's much, much worse than Evil Dead, so it can really make you think like you're wasting your life watching (which came to my mind a few times). I think the best thing for most people would be to drink some drinks, have some friends around and laugh at that movie. Maybe that's a little hard, but I do not think so, rent it and you'll see. I.
