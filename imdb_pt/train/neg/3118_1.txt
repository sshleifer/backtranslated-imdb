I felt the film was dry ... very disappointing without plot .. he waited for something to happen and nothing dried up like a bone .. a waste of money .. One of the worst films Robins Williams .. if you do not Believe me, wait a few months, it will be released on DVD because this seems to be a standard for movies that do not do well in theaters, they are rented out before the end of the year ... This is one you will not want to see or tell you why I spent my money on this! Also, being such a new movie, there were only 8 people watching ... It was on a Friday night at 9:50. I also felt I needed some more emotion or something to keep us awake. When the characters spoke in the movie, the voices were too low, you could not hear what they were saying.
