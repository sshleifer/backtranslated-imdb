I'm generally more willing to have an open mind about coms rom than many, but this simply was not a very good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparisons with the British original - I have not seen it, and I doubt I will. It has a lot to do with a sinuous plot, lack of chemistry between the protagonists and a performance / character of its supposed protagonist (Jimmy Fallon). Fallon enters the canvas wearing his clothes. and hairstyle of a 15-year-old and working a decade younger than that. He is supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course it is well known that school makes the whole world love hiring less mature individuals than the children they intend to teach. The character is so disturbing and irrational that I have my doubts if any actor could have made him sympathetic, but trusted olds like John Cusack or Adam Sandler could have been able to try. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor actor, but seems to think he is both. Not once in the whole movie do you believe in Fallon in his role, or do you believe there is any way these two people are or are together. Near the end of the movie is a scene in which Barrymore (who was cute as usual, but could not carry it alone - it's hard to have a romance of one person) tells Fallon that it's over, a lot has happened and she's moving. in. And instead of feeling bad about the scene, or mourning for Fallon, you're actively cheering for her - finally she does what she should have done months ago. But of course the mechanics of the plot will not allow that to be the end (an end that could actually have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we can see the rational career girl throwing it all away to pursue this childish idiot and encourage their illusions. Of course it's to be sticky and rewarding, but it actually made me more pissed off than anything else.
