First let me start this post by saying that I'm a fan of the original Star Wars movies ... I do not read the books, play the games, wear underwear or like cereal (if any). I'm simply a fan of the movies. <br /> <br /> With that said, I strive to see how people are giving this movie a great compliment. Taking this film by itself, and not comparing it with its terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say that this is an incredible movie. For all the terrible glitches in the script - cheesy dialogues, planned scenes (for example, R2 being suddenly a tough guy and long chase scenes in CGI that have little human contact), HORRIBLE acting and remarkable holes ... like this is good? ? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin; It looked like a switch was turned upside down and he was suddenly sick. I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes (which by the way was ruined by the "NOOOOOO!" Scene by Frankenstein). When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the blanks with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is not a great movie. For a film with such a "somber" tone, there was a lot of levity in ALL characters' speech. <br /> <br /> I close with a question: From the beginning to the end of the movie, was there really a sense of urgency and importance to what was really going on?
