I just read a review advocating this movie because I had a low budget, now my take on things. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters were fairly well animated, but were implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes were neither fights, it was just an actor's scene, then a monster shot with a lot of interaction at all. When the monster interacts, it looks like it was made in paintshop pro. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use models and puppets. They may not look so chic, but at least they interact, just look at the first Peter Jacksons movies. <br /> <br /> As for acting, Beowulf did a descent job, but the rest of the cast was not trying or they forgot. where they where. <br /> <br /> The script seemed confusing to me. In a minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day settling into the next day you talk about Shakespeare. I'm not saying it should be all "you" and "whatever," but you need to find a cohesive balance so that the lines sound like they come from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed a part near the beginning when Beowulf was quoting the old testament that would have been discovered had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is a bit polished. but one turn, however.
