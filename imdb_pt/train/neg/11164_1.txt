What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to be trying to copy avant-garde comedy, but the direction and script were sloppy, sickly and sentimental in the worst movie tradition. The role / role of Jack Black was self-indulgent and selfish ... and the other characters were equally unmasked and uninteresting. The soundtrack was tedious. We are (were) fans of Black, but none of us did more than deal with a forced laugh all the time. Why did he feel he had to make that mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not see another one of your movies without reading the reviews with more attention first! <br /> <br /> Was he drunk when he read the book? Before you sign up for this drivel?
