It is interesting that a novel without plot has become the basis of two films. While The Heiress was a good adaptation, if not quite accurate, Washington Square is a heavy and poorly performed hand, except for Dr. Sloper's part, a film that could have been much better. <br /> <br /> The director's attempts to make "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I actually cringed. There is nothing of the discreet and simple beauty that a movie without plot can have, like Onegin. I agree with other comments about Catherine's portrait of Catherine as an idiot rather than naive and timid; she made me despise her for not feeling for her. <br /> <br /> Catherine's transition from childlike trust to adult cynicism, the main point of the story, was internalized, just as in the novel. But we do not have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us this in a movie! I think someone jumped from adaptation school to film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's attempts to make a beautiful and thrilling movie from a difficult text, but it just did not work.
