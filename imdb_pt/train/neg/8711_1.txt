OK ..... This is the third in the series of carnosaurus. Lets star with the dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the movie, you can not see the cause of Dino when the body count begins, you can only see the sight of Dino's eye, too clever to hide the bad puppets! and perhaps in 16 minutes ahead in the film some special force team with Scott Valentine as the leader Rance, the team enters the warehouse and then they begin to find body parts and corpses after the attack of Dino, after a time a great box has been failing in the team and you can hear a scream velociraptor, very scary !!! and then a black girl walks forward and now a mistake is found! He raises a raptor's hand and cuts off his face, but if you stop when the raptor's hand comes, you can see it's just a guy with a hand puppet !? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist attacks cause some trucks, despite washing some guns there. 2. Where they died wrong seems to be ten tons of raptor and a giant T-Rex in there! How did t-rex fit there ??? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Sadly some stupid blonde girl told him to capture one of them alive = (4. Holy Jesus the kidnappers have wheels in their deeds!) 5. The Dino is now on a boat in the Pacific 6: Strange I did not know that the T-Rex had a strange thing on his neck 7. THE END The movie is good if you want a good laugh.
