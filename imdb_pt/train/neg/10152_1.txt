Being a fan of cheesy horror movies, I saw this in my video store and thought I'd try. Now that I have seen, I do not desire the living soul on the planet. I get my movie locations for free, and I feel like I did not get my money. I've seen some badly cheesy horror movies in my time, damn I'm a fan of them, but that was just an insult.
