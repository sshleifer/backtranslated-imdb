Not the best movie to remember for Paul Naschy. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came as the competition was so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is described as adventure and horror. Forget the horror - there is none. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; just an adventure of Robin Hood against an evil Baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to be King. The main feature of the film was to see Graciela Nilson, who only made four films in two years and disappeared to the our unfortunate loss. Where she went?
