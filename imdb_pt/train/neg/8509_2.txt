I saw this movie for a number of reasons, being the main Mira Sorvino. With her in the cast, it could not be so bad. And it even looked like it had some mystery and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was very good at 'Unfaithful'. The story takes place in Spain so it can be an exotic entertainment film with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking the same thing, let me warn you: this is really horrible, uninteresting boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> History is planned with subplots that add nothing to the narrative. They try to build a slasher / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain, but they fail horribly. The twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> The characters are paper thin! I did not care about anyone. More than that, they are annoying and very odious people. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious. Look, what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You are an oscar winner! Keep some dignity! His character was weak, but that's no excuse for such horrible performance. She seems to be sleepwalking the whole movie. Come to think of it, I really think I saw your eyes closing slowly in some scenes. I used to think that this woman was sexy. Well, she's not here. If you want to look at some skin, try Romi and Michelle because there is nothing to see here. What about that accent? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It is very painful to remember your performance to describe it here. I'm sorry, but I can not. I've had enough of this rubbish. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is depressing! It is so bad in every way that it is a wonder how it was made. Bad team to produce a bad script and earn some money with the name of the actor. Do not fall for it. <br /> <br /> Avoid! <br /> <br />
