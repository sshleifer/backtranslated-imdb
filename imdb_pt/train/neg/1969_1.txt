I just watched this movie and I must say that although it was shown at first some effort to produce a decent movie, this was absolutely horrible - but not in the sense that it was intentional that I'm sure. It was as if a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all possible viewers are stupid OR extremely difficult to amuse OR both ... Thank God for the fast forward! I can not imagine the kind of viewer the producer had in mind when making this movie. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, albeit evil, and a script that cries for a total rewrite, ... I can not say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to make horror movies, that would be a good effort. <br /> <br /> If you found this movie entertaining, then I suggest you seek guidance on the purpose of the films. There is much better rate out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but most of all, avoid crap like that.
