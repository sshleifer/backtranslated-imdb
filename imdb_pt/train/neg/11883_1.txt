After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I could also be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here's the plot (potential spoilers, if you care): A neurotic candy-addicted man (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temp to a ridiculous company. Suddenly he is offered the chance to "go perm," which seems to be the favorite phrase of this movie. But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp, Josh decides for any stupid reason he does not want to. He desperately ruins several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. Her inability to send several "very important" letters within a certain period of time is supposedly hilarious, but she's just plain stupid. Josh knows and fools a lawyer and they end up in bed together (obviously a real-life Josh fantasy, since such a thing would never happen). A lot of other things happen, but it is very banal and meaningless to enter now. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this movie is heralded as a comedy, I only laughed twice during the film; the first time was the opening photo of Josh Kornbluth (my initial reaction was to quell the fear) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the scariest person I've ever seen. He is an uninteresting, overweight, bald-headed Jew who I believe has sex with beautiful women. I do not sympathize with Josh's character. He is lazy and unmotivated and I just do not appreciate the failed attempts at humor. Ignore this, even if your life depends on it.
