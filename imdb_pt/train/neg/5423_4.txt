I've been using IMDb a few years, but I've never written any reviews before. However, this movie disappointed me so much (even with a modest 6.4 rating at the time of writing) that I could not shut up. <br /> <br /> Noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so disturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter ego as a watchman, "The Rectifier," and vandalizes any car that find a car alarm. <br /> <br /> Movie name to be a bit of a misnomer. Although there are one or two instances of other noise sources being addressed or mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist are the car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There is no other focus. When the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems that it has just been released to give credit to the actions of the character of Robbins. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all annoyed by the noise. No one likes the sound of car alarms. Of course, we all have this inner desire to take a baseball bat to a shrill vehicle, and that movie uses that fact, and pretty much that alone, to sell that movie. I say "a lot" because there is also ostensibly planned sexual intercourse (including a completely unnecessary trio) that is obviously thrown at moviegoers who need such things thrown in for a movie. Honestly, you're rolling your eyes. <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, very soon in the film, becomes completely unreliable. It seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise any longer, and even more so, by focusing so much on the noise, he began to lose his sanity. The first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he transforms from just a sullen, angry face to this guy's hero, The Rectifier. However ... the transformation does not occur. It is only renamed. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a while. Generalized and irritating social commentaries come up from time to time to heighten the claim of the film, and the laughter of satisfaction that never leaves Robbins on his face does not help either. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's pretty obvious what this movie is trying to be, since it's practically stuck in your throat, but in my opinion, it fails a lot. Just the opinion of a guy, cheers.
