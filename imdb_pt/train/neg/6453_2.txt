There is almost nothing to recommend this movie. Chase Masterson is always good to see and really can act, although his role in this clunker is a waste. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast ranges from poor to mediocre. In many movies like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference. No such luck here. The Monster is a man in a rubber suit that goes back to the days of Paul Blaisdell, so bad that it's good! The rest of the show is so bad it's bad. A little humor could have made it more palatable, but everyone throws deadly material without grace. There is a twist or two in the end, but then you will not care anymore.
