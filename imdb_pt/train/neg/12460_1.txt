We give up at the point where George Clooney's character has his nails drawn. We were not picky - having been seated for an hour of such nonsense, we just knew what it was like. To say that this movie was incomprehensible, a tedious and pretentious boredom would be to praise it too much! How have people managed to sit through this confusing, slow and depressing corner of a movie, much less point you to an Oscar? Clooney looked as sick as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh ... and what about those captions? - We just had a failed DVD or the original movie was made so - the phrases stayed in the air? The movie was hard enough to go on without it too. I pity the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.
