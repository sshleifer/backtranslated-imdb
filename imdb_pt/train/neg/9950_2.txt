If the original idea had been kept (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie might have worked. Unfortunately, racism had to come in (literally) and ruin everything. The predominantly black production team could not allow the antagonist to be black, so they switched roles from Rutger and Ice-T. This was only the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's newsroom approach to "driving" only found that this was another affirmative action task. Shot master, close-up, close-up. Gads, "Who's the line is anyway" even uses more creative camera work. Eric's rewriting of "The Most Dangerous Game" is at least an attempt to modernize the classic tale, but it gives us no motivation why the characters are doing it. We are never given the reasons, plus "no one will miss these people," because the leader (rewritten as Rutger) does these things. Aside from a hearty performance by John McGinley and an honest job by Charles Dutton, do not worry about it. A little trivia, there was a real accident during the filming that injured F. Murray Abraham, and resulted in the death of the young drunk driver who caused the accident.
