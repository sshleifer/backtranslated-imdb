Ohhh the brutality, ohhhhh the dying race, ohhhh the feeling of loss, ohhhh the prejudice! Why, when will all the tearful revisionists stop looking at Westerners for crying out loud? S ** t happens. If you offend your socially designed sensibilities, go back to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Boring, tedious and tiring waste of celluloid - particularly in the light of the presence of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you're obsessed with nineteenth-century desert dentistry. It may have been a bit better without the constant drift of the Mexican guy out of place with the bad tooth. A monument to the ultra-left stupid sensibility of the 60s / 70s. Practically impossible to sit through the entire movie. I think I'd rather have my eyes open for the whole Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 horses / 10 - all dead in hell.
