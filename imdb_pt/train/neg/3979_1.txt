OK, this has 2 being one of the worst excuses 4 a movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Like all of Olsen's other twin films, with the possible exception of the New York minute, this movie had no storyline, plot holes, disgustingly putrid attitudes, and really bad footage !!!!!!!!! if you have not already guessed, I HATE MARY KATE AND ASHLEY !!!!!! The only reason I watched this was because I was really bored and nothing else was connected. I wonder if the twins will NEVER stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic place and save the day meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who drool them out right away. The least they could be would be to have a guy of 4 1 of them or have both falling 4 the same guy. The plot in this story was so stupid and just stupid. even a child could see the faults in it. Maybe they should split up and start making films individually or maybe films with a different kind of story. Anyone who has enjoyed this movie has not been offensive - be really stupid, really artificial or have not seen any really good movies. or maybe they're really smart and have only bad movie choices. Anyway I do not recommend this movie to my worst enemy for a good movie experience .. the only thing that is good 4 is a laugh sharing rib in the pathetic attempts to be cool. if you watch laughter, it's hilarious. basically I give 0 or less.
