Nicole Eggert was listed as the star of this, although Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach were much bigger stars than she. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is kind of a spin on the movie "Alien lands on Earth". Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an Alien being chased by the military and takes the runaway creature in its very sexy disguise. A little nudity and partial nudity, a senseless sex scene, all along the way. <br /> <br /> The movie stumbles on some obvious scenes and makes jokes about being photographed. I really enjoyed the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and he had a really cool death scene. It was pretty obvious that Stacey Keach would be shot and the movie had a weak end, it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien passed on to Eggert.
