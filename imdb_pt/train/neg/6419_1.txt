Think of the end of Grudge 2 with the following: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cutting herself - and a scary mirror <br /> <br /> OH AND UNDERWATER WATER ANIMALS ... yay ... <br /> <br /> not a good movie ... I really did not like anything. The poster for the movie is extremely misleading too and I found it was just to suck people in to watch ... I can not believe I went. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... go see Saw III ... a movie where writing makes you feel like there's an effort ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and I are out.
