I was angry that someone made this movie. I was even angrier at having lost valuable minutes of my life sitting to watch it. I could have taken a wax job and had more fun. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. I was a bit confused at first, but then I realized what was happening. By now the movie was in the middle, and yes, I am a procrastinator, but I always want to see things through. So I showed it all. Not only are the actors not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions, they just are not convincing. I have seen my nephew weep for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust depicted on the screen in this film. If you like bad movies with bad acting, watch it.
