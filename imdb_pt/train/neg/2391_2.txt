I love movies. I love independent efforts and great studio productions. I love movies with stars and I love those with unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action adventures, sci-fi, mysteries, western, any genre except horror. I love foreign films as well as those in English. I love good movies and even love the bad ones, because almost no movie fails to entertain or amuse on some level. Except for "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues". <br /> <br /> When I attended a "Cowgirls" performance late at night, I joined an audience of about 10. Less than half, I stayed alone. Soon, not even I could tolerate the disturbing confusion that unfolded before my eyes, and also I left. To this day, "Cowgirls" remains the only film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how to describe this incoherent, empty, worthless, meaningless film, or how to adequately convey its content. lack of redeeming value. Suffice it to say that it is one of the greatest films of all time, absurd and inexcusable at all levels. He tries to be intelligent, but his conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. He tries to be funny, but his humor is coarse and worthy of embarrassment. This is one of the few films that can defile their own ethos by portraying the protagonists in a way that revolts against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch "Waterworld", "Ishtar", anything but that. Except for the new "Alexander." If you're choosing between this and that, read a book.
