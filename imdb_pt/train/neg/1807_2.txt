I admit, having matured in the hippie-dippy age, I'm a sucker for this type of movies. I can enjoy a bit more of the hippie genre than most "normal" people. However, this movie is simply horrible in every conceivable way. <br /> <br /> Every banal perception of hippie folly is presented as a gospel, police kill a young long hair when he peacefully lands an airplane. This movie is so horrible that it is not even funny to see it as a joy in the excesses of the hippie zombie. It's like a left version of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave it two stars was because there are some obscurity of interest in the soundtrack, in addition, I could not find a selection for negative stars. No actor, almost no plot, sheeze, hardly a script ... you got it, an "art" movie ... All this done in the slowness of the root canal, dragging each scene meaninglessly just to fill the time. twisting bizarre life imitating art, the movie's "nonactor" star joined a commune in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his co-thieves was killed and he was sent to the prison where he was killed in a suspicious weight lifting "accident" ..... and just think, he has to leave it behind as a legacy .... Oy vey.
