This is another typical and unbelievable part of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in a work outfit, convinces me that he was a 2nd best base. Ray Liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual cardboard, and does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Each scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable to the end when Kurt cleaves Ray with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. Kurt and Madeline then make their obligatory hug at the end of the movie, and ALL - except Russell and Stowe, KNOWS Liotta will come back and threaten the couple again. <br /> <br /> of course, and Russell punches him 10 times with his 9mm, which was totally unnecessary. This movie could also have ended with the concussion scene - EXCEPT Hollywood loves unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "better," the more slimy they get.
