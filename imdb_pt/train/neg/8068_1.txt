I did not have HUGE expectations for this movie when renting it for $ 1 at the video store, but the box at least showed a little promise with its "killer cut" of "More Blood! More Sex!" Can not go wrong there! Well ... needless to say the box is a scam. How had not actors and actresses of that caliber signed such a low movie? <br /> <br /> It all starts with a drunken college girl coming out of a fraternity house or some other building like that and saying some useless shit to her boyfriend (?) like a camera on a bad steadicam follows her. Then she is chased by some guy in a transparent plastic mask and grabbed by another. They cut their wrists for no real reason and you can see when they "cut" it that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same theme of the girl being chased. / killed mercilessly for two guys for another 84 minutes. Add a shot of tit. This is Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have had any problem with this movie if the box had not involved me in renting the movie. If I rented a bad movie that claims to have more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! A full frontal shot in 85 minutes of a girl who is clearly androgenic and with blood that would not scare a child did not cut her off. If this is the cut of the killer, what is the theatrical cut?! Of course, I doubt that this garbage has been put in theaters in the first place. Shame on the actors in this movie. I could see them making their onscreen debut here because they did not do anything before, but they were all set before it was released. I do not know if it was filmed before everyone was settled and the studio sat on the film until they were semi-big names or not. But what I want to know is ... they spent $ 14 million on that movie?
