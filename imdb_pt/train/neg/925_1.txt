Okay, this movie f * ck in 'rules. is undoubtedly one of the most technically inefficient pieces of film ever made. absolutely terrible, but you have to see it. rent it out with your friends and come with a drink or just have fun, it's hilarious. and the behind-the-scenes featurette proves that, you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint. impressive. Ok, rent it just for this scene: two characters are actually walking for about 3 minutes in a shot. the director (in the comment) says "yes, the tracking was so smooth it looks like they are ...". Yeah, right man, they're totally walking in place. It's so funny.
