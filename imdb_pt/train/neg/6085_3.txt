In this paranoid-driven potboiler, our reporter hero faces tough authorities, dubious coworkers, renegade UFO disqualifiers, and silent, elusive aliens. (Although it is able to control the mind and zapping objects from afar, it takes three of them to operate a control panel with about two dozen buttons.) The script goes from event to event, leaving the puzzles in abundance. Why did the aliens blind the dog? Why do they fry soldiers with radiation when they are just patrolling an empty landing site? And what spatial faces that are worth your moon cheese kidnap the ugly photographer first rather than your model? Inquiring minds want to know! Screenwriter-director Mario Gariazzo apparently searched his subject as he flipped through a pile of UFO-themed tabloids as he watched a feature film of Sunn Classics. (The closing screen screening prides itself on being based on actual events ... just like "Plan 9!") Some may feel burnt by the abrupt end, but it should still appeal to conspiracy cranks.
