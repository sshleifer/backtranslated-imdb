The same difficulty I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies equally to "Oliver." Instead of the writing of the composers in the stylistic period of the piece, they simply wrote Broadway-like melodies, which were historically unidomatic and stylistically distorted. Also, blatant brutality and the unpleasant activities of dramaturgy. do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties that permeate the score. It's an uncomfortable mix that leaves a decidedly sour luck. <br /> <br /> The cast of the boy Oliver does not help: an attempt at timbre and extremely precious, there is something less than solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine properly, although the songs he is forced to sing have little basis in the period. <br /> <br /> "As long as he needs me" is given a strident, hoarse, tense interpretation. The two major production numbers, "Who Will Buy" and "Consider Yourself," seem overproduced, with everything but the kitchen sink. One thing is everything, plus one to cross the line in excess. <br /> <br /> The sadness, despair, and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to suit such ditties and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess that I have problems with the conscience of Mr. Dickens, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extent of his personal life without joy, which was full of disappointment and regret. Not all the combined talent of this production, whether on camera or behind it, can overcome the non-constructive nature of the basic material. All of this results in an uncomfortable experience for me. <br /> <br />
