I anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the Broadway play. I waited and read comments for months on the award-winning performances. I mean, with the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the movie could not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? WRONG! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film did not match the publicity hype that was given and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy's performance of James Brownesque rescues the film exactly when it hits its screen. <br /> <br /> Several calms and Jennifer Hudson's performance make you pay attention every time she's onscreen. His performance of "And I Am Telling You" was the only time I felt the hype was deserved. You cringed when she begged you that no good man would let you stay in the group and in your life. As many critics have said, she steals the movie from the most experienced actors and deserves all the praise she receives for this performance. Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with great voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles, on the other hand, went through their performances. Foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to be prior to her extraordinary "Ray" performance and Beyoncé Knowles was in an extended fashion photo shoot or video filming, posing and dancing on her way through the film. His performance was not strong enough to make you worry about your character at any point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The film was very sensational, 30 minutes and 1 song (the solo of Beyoncé "sincero" for Jamie Foxx) a long time. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
