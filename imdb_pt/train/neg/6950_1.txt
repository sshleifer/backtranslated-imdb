We all knew before even being shown, Ron Moore's miniseries is not Battlestar Galactica. That's nice. It just means you have to be on your own. You can not lean on Battlestar Galactica. If it's good, it's good on its own merits, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the reports are true, that's what Moore wanted. However, if his mini-series rotted, he embarrassed all the excellent actors who came on the screen, not to mention the myriad of people off-screen. And that's what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series is not a remake. I would not even say it's a re-imagination. It's a new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not happen in the Galactic universe, with the same places and jargon and technology. It does not speak of Galactica's quest for the thirteenth tribe. Nor is it based on the legends and mysteries that sustained Galactica. The Ron Moore miniseries is a space opera action film with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say, "just another" space opera, action movie. Because, as the plots go, your little has original, or even interesting. I could convey everything to you without a spoiler warning. But I will not inflict this on you. I'm just going to hit the most important point. Ready now? Here it is: just watch the trailer. He will tell you everything in the story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the creations of man turn against man and seek to destroy man. (I think they forgot Azimov's rules again.) They look like humans, so there's the whole alien thing between us. At least there is no time travel. Oh, and lots of fight scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore was inspired by Galactica, that ceremonial nod, it came out bolder than respectful. I mean, could not he even think of something of his own? From the first minutes, I wanted to watch something else. I did not care about any of Moore's characters, since I could not identify with any of them. This hit me in the face when the Cylons began their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I did not care. How depressing. <br /> <br /> Moore's heroes, when faced with an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, instead, they doubled their tail and saved their own asses. After all, it was the only way to save mankind, yadda yadda yadda. They have taken the safe route, rather than risking their own lives to defend others. At least disgust is not apathy. <br /> <br /> But in the end, Ron Moore's miniseries was just purposeless activity, a movie on a treadmill, always running and going nowhere. And I just wanted it to end. And when it was over, my life force was sucked out of me. Against my own will, I was turning myself into a soulless, soulless zombie, probably the kind that this miniseries would appeal to. I needed to refuel. I needed - and I swear this is true - I needed to watch an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes, in fact, and I felt much better. And happier.
