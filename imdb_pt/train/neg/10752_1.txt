This movie was so disappointing. From the synopsis that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is that called?) I expected something artistic and thoughtful with beautiful images. He had some interesting images, but these often seemed random and did not make sense. In fact, they seemed to have been inserted to fill the time. In the end, the effect was apathetic. <br /> <br /> I believe the movie was made to be atmospheric, but it was not. The lack of a coherent plot did not help. You may say it was mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent, with no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be upset, but the plot did not appeal to me enough to worry about his situation. Without looking at the cast list, I would not know that you see the main character as a child. The movie has very little context for the time, place or character. I'm not a prude, but the sex scenes (they were several) seemed useless and confused me even more, I recognized, but I was not sure if it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband or if she was a prostitute. It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered that the hairy backs belonged to her lover. This film managed to make what should have been shocking (dream sequences involving Lulu's mother) seemed a bit boring. <br /> <br /> Filling the nails made more sense as it gave some indication of Lulu's emotional state. I will not criticize the actors as I did not have much to work on. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can not worry about talking about it anymore.
