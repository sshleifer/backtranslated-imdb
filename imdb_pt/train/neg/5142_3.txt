After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite, he did one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During this first year in films, Chaplin made about a third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in terms of improvisation, editing, gags, filming, etc. This is on a track where Chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying. Mabel Normand is there with her friend too, and Chaplin manages to get rid of his and Mabel's friends. He then lured Mabel into the bleachers without any apparent repercussion from her behavior. Lots of antics here, but there is very little else to recommend this movie to others then watching Chaplin develop. The impression I saw was severely deteriorated, which may have affected your enjoyment. Charley Chase can be glimpsed. * of 4 stars.
