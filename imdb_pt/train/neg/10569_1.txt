I tried watching this movie at a military camp during an overseas mission, and let me tell you, you will see anything under those circumstances. However, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes set the tone for the poor quality of porn movie, strange unexpected twists and unbelievable situations and behaviors. It gets worse after that. This movie does not have a single saving grace, and yet it's not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch. It's just awful. I've seen a lot of movies in my life and I'm not one of those snobbish critics, I mean I'm going to enjoy most of the movies to some extent, even if they are bad. This man. <br /> <br /> Steer, of course, my friend.
