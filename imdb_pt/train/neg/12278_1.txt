By watching this show you are not sure if it is the story or the acting that is most annoying. First of all, the plot of each episode is very predictable, writers must have used every possible cliches, you can guess not only the general plot, but also the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character, making the program kind of a collage of all the police series out there. On top of everything comes the "message" of the show, that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good will prevail and that we should all love each other, be better men and better citizens, in the most ostentatious way. Actors, as vehicles of this message and nothing more than that, will use a limited set of acting skills: the smile "I am a good carrier," the worried look and body posture "victory is ours," while the bad guys have the "I'm a bad" frowning and the "you got me" look, followed by "I'm good for nothing and I should be removed from society" head bands (this kind of also sums up the overall development of each show ). True story or not, the show is rubbish, further proof that the producers do not care about the viewers, that we are all considered idiots. Well, this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains of you.
