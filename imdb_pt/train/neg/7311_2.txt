Okay, I had heard little about this movie, so when it came on the movie channels on TV, I wanted to watch it, being a horror buff. I think I can do a collective "huh?" for all who have watched. <br /> <br /> I decided to move on with my life, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw that it was coming and some of us already saw it decided that we could laugh our way, both proclaiming "this it's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. " It was not scary; I'll give it to Roth (which I think is a young hack); characters change throughout the film, wing "Cube". <br /> <br /> However, despite its typical "rats in a cage" scenario, whoever will connect who, etc., was quite average horror. <br/> <br /> Some points: 1.) What was with that boy? I'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people. I'm talking about all the "slow-motion karate kick", what was that? 2.) Okay, I know Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd's, but when I was young, I was shocked that he went ahead and bothered her in his sleep. Uh, this is illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about writing uselessly! 4.) What was with the deputy? 5.) So she was instantly separated by the dog? And there was little or no blood left? Just a piece of your jeans? Anyway we were LAUGHING our butts, and I love laughing during horror movies (Return of the Dead Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I do not know if we should be laughing here ...
