Peru unspeakably troubled, a mix of anti-Nazi musical (!!), American pre-war and Agatha Christie whodunit parody with a big and big problem: it's deadly bland. In addition to the single digit I.Q. plot and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is the berserk cast. Gene Wilder (starring and co-writer) strives for everything: he plays a romantic protagonist (with his looks !! and his age !! he and Woody Allen should start a club for no-holds-barred and spy comedians), and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and intelligent, and tries to sing and dance, and succeeds in NO !! A long shot from your good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> For a while I thought I was having a myopia in shape, because everyone in the movie keeps saying that Cherry Jones is a very hot girl, and that Michael Cumpsty is this incredibly handsome stallion !! The guy who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a skinny bald-headed actor with glasses as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies !! Mike Starr's exaggeration as the most incompetent and the fauxest police officer you've ever seen deserves to rank among the 10 most abominable presentations in recent movie history. The saddest note is to see wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely miscaded and offensively squandered. At least I hope both stars have paid their bills back home (and subsequently fired their agents) with this flop. No wonder the prodigious Sukowa prodigy has returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had in store for her! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to get a really bad movie with a bad script with a furious cast director, study this one - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
