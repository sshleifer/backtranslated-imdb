As this movie earns a rating of 6.7 is unbelievable. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and clearly must be among the 100 worst films of the IMDb of all time. The National Treasure is an affront to national intelligence and yet another attack on the American public by Hollywood. Critics told you about the holes you could make with a 16-wheeler. <br /> <br /> I love the justifications for this movie being good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come on, people, no wonder people all over the world think Americans are stupid. This has to be the most stupid and insulting movie I've ever seen. If you want to see a really decent movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. The National Treasure, unfortunately, received much more publicity than those wonderful films. I bet most of you who are reading this have not even heard of them, since some have not yet been released. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a great actor - when he's in the right movies. Time after time I saw Cage squander his incredible talent on horrible movies like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is well employed, as in Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation, he is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> In short, I prefer to feed my hand with a wood chipper than to be subjected to this visual atrocity again.
