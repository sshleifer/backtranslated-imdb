This film describes the experiences of a couple of murderers (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two drag queens over a few hours of a night in Miami. The converging stories end up bringing all people together in one place and time. The film was mildly entertaining but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point of being impossible to see what was happening. In some scenes you can actually see where they tried to "stretch" the development process to save the images. Someone did not know how to operate a movie camera. Amazing that this movie has been released!
