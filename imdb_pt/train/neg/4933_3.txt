This movie was not so bad when compared to the first two strings of the original. It is directed by Martin Kitrosser from Friday the 13th to fame. The acting is really really bad, but the blood and special effects help make it interesting. That's one thing I like about Screaming Mad George (makeup effects artist for the movie), its effects are so strange and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they are going to get. The movie is not really that bloody but there is an extremely nasty scene in the middle involving a toy larva (what!?!) Mickey Rooney makes an appearance that he was probably not very enthusiastic but needed the money right now, possibly? If you liked the weird 4th episode (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one. I liked it better than the Matrix! Appreciate.
