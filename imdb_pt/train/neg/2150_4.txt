You will recognize the plot immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to get Mom and Dad back together. Yes, that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's the scary thing. Although Deanna Durbin is younger than Hayley Mills, 21, while playing the daughter's roles, Durbin seems much older, as in adults. And so do all your so-called brothers. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film. The girls are dressed in cuddly sailor costumes, but they look ridiculous on them as the director seems to be struggling to point to his ample tops and collections throughout the film. So you are constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start "giving up" them, you get the impression that they are pedophiles, and you too can be one of them, by noticing what costumes and tops the director pointed out. Teenagers or seducers, little girls or foxes, you're never sure what you should be thinking about them. <br /> <br /> Parents also seem very old and the whole movie looks very old-fashioned. <br /> <br /> It's a rusty version of Parent Trap and you should avoid it, or at least make sure your tetanus shots are up-to-date if you do not believe me.
