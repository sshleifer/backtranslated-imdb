This is not a good movie. It's disjointed, the whole performance is bad, and it has a lame story that you've seen a thousand times done so much better elsewhere. Not to mention you can see every dot of the plot coming from a mile away. Worst of all, no one bothered to tell Lonette Mckee that she could not sing. But who cares, she is soooo good-looking. But I disagree, nothing new here. A bunch of hot girls are taken advantage of, someone gets addicted to drugs, someone gets addicted to a guy, someone goes out, and then the horrible things happen. Surprise surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can not believe that many people think this is a good movie. Many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to classifying black films. I do not touch that! If you want to support these movies going to see them - great! If you liked it - super! Each one in his. But do not try to tell me it was good. Pleeeease! I wish people of color would not like this kind of film just because they have black actors. Want to see a good African-American movie? See the love Jones. Lightning. Or the color purple. These would be great movies, no matter the actors' skin color. Because? Because they told compelling stories with great acting that made you feel long after you left the theater. Just because it's our experience is not automatically a good movie. It's only good - when it's good. Period.
