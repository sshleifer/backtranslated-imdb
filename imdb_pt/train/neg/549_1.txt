I can not believe that the Indian film industry still eliminates this third category shortage as Waqt. To begin with, is the plot totally implausible? The spoiled son is expelled from the family home to teach him some self-sufficiency. So, what does he do? He promptly continues to win some national talent contest by making some star jumps in front of a panel of judges (I honestly am not joking here). Meanwhile, his father is dying of lung cancer but keeps his son secret, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson and also to make a new toy giraffe with his own hands . <br /> <br /> Is acting worth cringe in your haste? No effort was made to try to act convincingly by any of the main actors in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by real-world concerns. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers when such hideous movies are made are the smart viewers. who made the mistake of seeing such a movie. Actors such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar will still be revered as Gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
