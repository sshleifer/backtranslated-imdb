Born, educated, and educated in Scotland, I was shocked by this disgusting portrait of a man who was neither more nor less than a thief of cattle. Worse still, the whole movie segment was sex in one form or another, by implication or verbally. To see it, one would think that eighteenth-century Scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals. Lange was a joke acting like the "young" mother at age 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" in a Scottish lake is not common as they portrayed it - but it has given them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how we are sexually driven. Save your money and watch Pinnochio.
