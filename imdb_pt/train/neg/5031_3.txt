The 1965 original Japanese film "Gamera", http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an update from the more obscure Gojira (Godzilla) to the sensibilities of the 1960s. Gamera, of course, is a gigantic torch that launches fire and literally consumes energy - not as big as some versions of Godzilla, but usually similar in most ways. <br /> <br /> This version of the original film was edited and recreated by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla ("Godzilla, the King of Monsters"), "Gammera the Invincible" gets more than just the wrong spelling. American scenes are not as ridiculous and annoying as those that are added to the great Gojira, but they also do not contribute much to the story because there is little accompaniment to them. <br /> <br /> The film starts promising, there are some scenes that are worth the development of the character, and there are enough personalities to create some tension off the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the movie begins to fall into a well run-of-the-mill kaiju movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is good enough, even the American add-ons are OK. The direction is very good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad for your time (all thumbnails). Some of the scenarios and scenarios are actually very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little or nothing original in this movie. Gamera, however, develops a much more original personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.
