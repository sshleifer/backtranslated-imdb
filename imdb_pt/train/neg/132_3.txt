"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon, and a year later he left the jungle ... naked. Supposedly, "Keep the river to your right" is "a modern cannibal tale". In fact, anyone looking for any insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the film is more like a travel diary of New Ginuea, mainly spreading the native art. The second half is based on photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but it's actually about that. Unless, of course, you're interested in home movies of a Jewish wedding, or Schneerbaum featuring your old male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal tale". - MERK
