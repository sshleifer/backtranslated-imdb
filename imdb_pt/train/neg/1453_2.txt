I'm not sure if it was the language or the bad acting, but everything about this movie seems cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang, this is a big disappointment. There is no connection between different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly poor that I did not even believe people could make such a huge mess of something that had great potential. <br /> <br /> And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. . Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound, and especially Hitler himself sounds like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me believe that it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened. <br /> <br /> Whether it's English or the fact that I've seen Der Untergang, everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous.
