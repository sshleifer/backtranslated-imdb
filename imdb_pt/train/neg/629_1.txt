I desperately want to give a 10 to this movie ... I really want to. Some movies, especially horror movies, are so cheap that they are good. A wise ninja scarecrow who can apply corn cobs as lethal weaponry ... definitely fits into this 'budget for glow' system. The depth of the film is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns that it implements by keeping the audience at the edge of their seats actually directs the scary ... ninja ... hit by puberty ... 30-year-old pre-student ... non-cowboy drawing ... smart-ass ... son-of-a-bitch scarecrow in the limelight as the scariest horror icon of the year. All I can say is 'you can enjoy' and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you like that hilarious horror. <br /> <br /> (WHAT THE HELL SMOKE ?! '
