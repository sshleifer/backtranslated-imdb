A group of extremely unpleasant Holes are plagued by lame dolls that some elderly night watchmen keep locked in a movie vault for twenty years for no reason. <br /> <br /> Many people know about this movie. only from the localized seams of the MST3K in the film. But I've seen the movie and I can safely say yes, it's bad, really, really bad. From one of the most horrific 'fight' scenes I've ever witnessed with the stuffed aliens who suffer from the lack of movement (I had a My Pet Monster that was more scary) to the appalling performance (I had a My Pet Monster that was more charismatic) However, what was said of Rick Sloan's "Vice Academy" movies are somehow, and trust me I have no idea how much worse. This is not to suggest that this movie is anything but crap because it is not. Just throwing it out there. Eye Candy: No nudity in the movie itself, but there are 2 pairs of breasts on the DVD Introduction to the movie <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Jim Wynorski Introduction; Gallery of stills; and Trailer for this movie
