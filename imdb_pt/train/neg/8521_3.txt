That gives a little bit of the plot, by the way. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach the value of Christmas and enjoy the holidays. This, however, does not. He tries to capture the excitement of A Charlie Brown Christmas, there is yet another piece of Christmas but fails with bland and easy jokes. Charlie Brown is no longer thinking about the Christmas spirit, but wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the movie. Here's one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but does not know how to spell Charlie (for some reason he needs to be in her letter), so she decides to name him Sam because she knows how to spell Sam. In addition, Sally plays an angel in the game with a word for the day: "Hark!" Instead, she says hockey stick (har har). If Sally says that listening 12 times (all strangely sounding exactly the same) does not kill you, nothing will happen. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a great focal point, but that hardly makes it any better. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. She sounds like a boy (who does not dispel the rumors) and gets angry when it has to be the sheep in the play (terrible baas and everything). Apparently she's the sheep every year, and she's worried she'll forget her lines (lines she does not have). She is so worried that she mentions it twice, one after another, and receives the same answer. I'm guessing she should have short term memory loss, or something. Lucy and Linus are most welcome (though Linus still has boring advice), but it's hardly a lot of air time. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in it. All in all, he tries to be a parasite to the original, but compromised the message by a few quick laughs.
