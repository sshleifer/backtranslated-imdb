I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is very good, and you are wandering about what is to come ....... That is nothing. All the open lines of history remain open; two characters that at first seemed to be of some importance are completely left out of the scene except for 1 or 2 very short scenes. I wander if Ilya had not done better just to leave them completely off ... As for the remaining character, nothing is done with it either. She just visits some horrible place, and suddenly the movie is not about her anymore, but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls with bread, drinking homemade vodka and apparently blinking at each other. Some may say that the film does well in showing a society in ruins, like the IFFR judges, but to me it's just bad taste, bad camera work, a bad script and a terribly bad direction. So I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to rating: 1!
