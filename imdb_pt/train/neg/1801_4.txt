Istanbul is another of those foreign films that Errol Flynn was doing in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS. It's a remake of Fred MacMurray's Ava Gardner film from Singapore a decade ago. <br /> <br /> Unlike that studio product, Istanbul has the advantage of having a great cinematographic location in sight of the Golden Horn. But Errol Flynn, who was aging exponentially on camera in every movie, was too old to be playing these kinds of action / adventure any longer. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really have no conviction. <br /> <br /> As for Cornell, she plays Errol's ex-girlfriend who, through the trauma of being saved from a fire, now has amnesia. She does not remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer, who stand behind some diamonds that came to him. I have to deal with them too. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano. Most people today do not realize that Cole was a talented jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. In fact, he was first pianist, the singing was a belated reflection. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure film for those who are fans of this type of film.
