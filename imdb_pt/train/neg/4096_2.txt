This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, the husband had left her because she did not live in any commune with him (he was crazy that Reagan was elected and wanted to turn his back on society). At that moment I had problems with the series - come on, I say to myself, is this the same nobleman Michael Stivic who contradicted Archie Bunker's right-wing philosophies? The series continued, but it simply had nothing of enthusiasm. Whatever momentum Sally Struthers has gained from All the Family, it's gone. Perhaps, if the series had been given another name and presented as totally independent of All In The Family, it could have worked. Ah well, this is show business.
