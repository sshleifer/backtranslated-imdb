I think the show had a good concept to work with. But the execution was poor. The script is poor and acting is bad. There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way, such as the protest against gay marriage or the discovery of the cemetery. The show can not properly be termed as comedy show because it lacks deplorable mood. I should say that this show barely managed to put the life of the Muslim community to any degree. <br /> <br /> So far, the second season is worse than the first. I had high hopes for this show, but I was kind of disappointed. I still like CBC to put that concept in front of the viewers. Anyway, I wish good luck for the future.
