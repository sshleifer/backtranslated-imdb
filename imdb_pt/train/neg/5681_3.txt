After having seen and loved Postal (yes, I actually loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and I chose Seed because I happened to stumble across a local DVD store and is supposed to be one of their best Although the first 10 15 minutes from the movie were very promising and looked like the beginning of a not very mainstream psychological thriller, it soon descended from there and eventually became one of the most generic slasher movies I've seen so far including a huge amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional responses and sub-par act. It seems that Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plan, but after a while he gave up. Maybe he should stick with the comedy? The few good things about this movie is that it manages to create a scary overall atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and that the soundtrack goes well with the overall atmosphere but the unbalanced pace of this movie combined with its total generic nature makes it the last half hour quite tedious to watch, which completely ruined my experience. There are shocking scenes very well done, but they seem to be there only by the value of the shock. And let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times. <br /> <br /> I hope Uwe Boll one day learns what makes a good movie, because among a lot of horrible movies he seems to make a good movie. movie from time to time. Seed just is not one of those.
