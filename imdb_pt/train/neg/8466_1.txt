Words fail me. <br /> <br /> And this is not common. <br /> <br /> Done correctly, this could have been great, funny science fiction spoof on B movie, but unfortunately it was not being. Rarely, in the field of drama, so many competent actors fought so vainly with breakfast with a script. I can only endorse comments from the previous reviewer - go clean the bathroom. In fact, do anything but watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Positives: Lucy Beeman's nose. Negatives: Everything else. <br /> <br /> More appropriate line: "This is not going anywhere." <br /> <br /> If every plastic surgeon could find such a destination.
