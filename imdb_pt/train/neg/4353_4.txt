The Class is a comedy series that portrays a group of 27-year-old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why it saddens me that The Class is not funny, even if it has the obvious potential. It's not corky enough, just dumb. (Haha.) This is due to a slow pace and lack of hilarious jokes. Also some actors have difficulties with time. The most inventively written characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even so they seem a bit too square for the sake of the show. On the other hand, the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and Duncan and Nicole. What bothers me with the series is that the only Latin character Aaron is being chosen for his accent (even if by a character not respectable, but anyway).
