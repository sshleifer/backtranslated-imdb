I saw an interview with Rob Schneider (who plays the lead character, Marvin Mange, in this movie). He said he wanted to emphasize so much physical comedy that even if you had the volume turned off, you'd be laughing. in this movie. Obviously, that must be the secret. I had the loud volume. I was really listening to this and thought it was a disaster, and completely bland - a big disappointment after Schneider's hilarious performance on "Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo." <br /> <br /> The story is stupid: Mange is a big loser who dreams of being a cop who is filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a kind of crazy scientist named appropriately Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton), and as a result begins to lose control of his "animal instincts". "It makes him a" supercop. "He can sniff drugs hidden in body cavities and fleeing horses. Of course, he also has a bad habit of eating people's cows and trying to seduce his goats, but this is certainly a small <br /> <br /> There is a more annoying actor in Hollywood than John McGinley? <br /> <br /> Here he plays Sgt. Sisk, commander of Mange in the police force as a disgusting cartoon character (much like his medical character in the inexplicable popular TV series "Scrubs.") I was eager to take a look at Colleen Haskell's first serious acting work (Can anything in this film to be called "serious"?) She, of course, gained her fame as a competitor in the first "Survivor" and she proves here what we knew of it: she's cute as a button. What she does not prove here is that she has some perceived talent as an actress. there is with Ed Asner as the Chief of Police Wilson. I mean, how old is this guy now? He is the size of some of the cows that Mange tried to eat, and he seemed to pant the entire time. I'm surprised he went through the filming. There is a brief appearance at the end by Adam Sandler (who also served as executive producer of this). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I laughed twice: Mange playing with his strident toys in the police car, and the Schneider Has scene with Haskell and the orangutan - the orangutan has more talent in acting! So, for two laughs - 2/10.
