I love Dracula, but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula films since when I was younger, and I thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know if it was my youth that made me believe that Lee was the best Dracula with style, looks, attraction and evil beneath it. Or maybe it was just this movie that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula with a snobby English accent and body language to accompany him? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is annoying and does not have any kind of tension ..? So this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - do not you see! I just gave it a 2 because somehow I managed to stay awake all through the movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and alone at home in a dark room with plenty of unprotected space behind you. Maybe alone at your parents' house or at a home of strangers. Because not even the characters in this movie seemed to be frightened, and I think that sums it all up! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this movie because of its place in Dracula's movie history, perhaps fascinated by how the film Dracula's story evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Because as the film is not so attractive, it does not draw you to the suggestive mystery that, to me, makes the vampire myth so fascinating. <br /> <br /> And besides, there's a lot of what people in bad taste feel about it. The setting looks like a cheap theater. And I do not say it rejecting everything done in the 70's. Because I can love old movies as well as new ones.
