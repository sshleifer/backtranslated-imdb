What a bad and bad movie! I tried to watch without rapid advance ... That failed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a boring and confusing movie. I do not think anyone can be knocked over by being hit with a fluorescent lamp and much less gutted by one !! The funny thing is that I watched the "The Killer Cut" version of the movie. The box boldly states "More blood!" "More sex!" "More terror than the theatrical release!" Damn it! If this movie was horrible with all those claims, I wonder how lame was the "UN-Killer Cut" ??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living and the world of the dead, watch any of the Night of the Living Dead series!
