This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. One of those movies that uses all the stupid people who talk about clich√© they can imagine. Arrrrgh. Don Johnson was very good indeed. But on the other hand that sucks. It's been over 10 years since I've seen it, but it still hurts and will not stop lingering in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film really epitomizes just how stupid it is. I will not ruin this for you if you want to try fate by watching this movie. But I guarantee a moment * nghya * in the end, with some in the middle. If you have nothing better to do, and like to aim and laugh, then maybe it's worth it. Also, if you're forced to go on a date with someone you do not like, suggest watching this movie together and they'll probably leave you alone after they watch you. That's a fair price to pay, I think.
