Such a pretentious and lame attempt to hypnotize. Scriptural and diabolical dialogue and truly embarrassing acting. Really the worst movie I've ever seen (at the movies). Nothing in my opinion saves this movie from being a total disaster. I saw it when you went out to a movie theater in Brighton. People were leaving and there were more people chatting outside the restrooms than in the auditorium! In the end, there was booing and scorn from the meager crowd that was very sad, as relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked really ashamed. However, the movie was so bad that I really could not feel that I sympathized with them. Everyone has to start from somewhere and their son started his acting career with this really horrible attempt at 'Tarantinism made in the UK'. 5 years are gone, but sometimes I still shiver with the memory of that sad night at the movies! This is a movie without redeeming features! I gave a 1 as 0 was not available. They should invent a "shameometer" for everyone involved in this movie mess. I know some of them have moved on to better things, the positive is that none of them could have sunk any more than that.
