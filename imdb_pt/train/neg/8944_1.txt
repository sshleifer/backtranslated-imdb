I saw this movie last year in the Media class and I have to say that I really hated it. I was in year 10 (and at age 15), so this may have something to do with it. But for English this year, 11 years, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. In addition to the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it. <br /> <br /> But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I have. I've seen it, and I think George Orwell is one of the craziest people who ever lived on this planet. I'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but unfortunately I did not like it. The themes of the film were well portrayed, but the way the whole movie was assembled and the events that took place within it did not conform to my standards. This is just my opinion, and I'm sure many other people really liked this movie.
