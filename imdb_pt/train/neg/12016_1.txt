If Bob Ludlum saw this miniseries, he would have wept. This was a complete waste of time and money. I read the book and although the films are not exactly what the book might be, CBS wasted time and money on it and it's embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> It may be that the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good the TV series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to demote? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
