This is really a new low in entertainment. Even if there are much worse movies. In the Gangster / Drug genre, it's hard to have a compelling storyline (this movie does not mean, I mean, Sebastians's motives, for example, could not be more sought after and worn out clich√©.) So you also need a set of character relationships that is believable (this movie does not.) <br /> <br /> Of course Tristan is taken from his family, but why was that again? What's the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to leave at his age? interesting picture though ask about the lack and need for rebellious behavior of children in the upper-class family. But this movie does not go that way. Even if there was the potential for judgment by random Backflashes. He was not discouraged anymore, why does he do it again? <br /> <br /> So there are some interesting issues raised here for a solid socially critical drama (but again, this film simply is not, by focusing on "legal" production techniques and special effects and not a moment to reflect and foremost forcing history along the way where they want it to be and not paying attention to let history breathe and naturally evolve.) <br /> <br /> She wants to be a drama not to glorify substance abuse and violence (it would be politically incorrect these days, would not it?) but on the other hand it is nothing more than a cheap action movie (as there are so many out there) with an average set of actors and one Vinnie Jones who is managing to not ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> So all in all I .. just ... can not recommend this. 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
