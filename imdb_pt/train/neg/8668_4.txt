I've never read Bradbury's novel on which this film is based, but from what I've learned it will be interesting (when I finally read it and I'll read it). My comments will be based purely on the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and I was so excited, but when I finally did, I was so disappointed it hurt. That's because the movie itself seemed so amateurish. The actors were not well chosen (although Robards and Pryce are good actors - but not here). Child actors, it seems, were merely asked to show up, dress the characters' clothes, say the lines and make faces. The scenery and accessories were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised by the horror that I had to go online and check who drove, just to see the kind of work he had done. The edition was cut and pasted and the plot (script) was also like this (although the author got involved, irony?). The construction of tension, fear and suspense was so light that it was ineffective when the climax finally arrived. <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments about this movie and find it hard to believe that people really like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting, fun and intriguing. This had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad it takes away the brilliance of the story.
