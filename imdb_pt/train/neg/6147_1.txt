I do not really get all the adulation that this movie got. He is stingy, unnecessarily manipulative, and dodges many of the big issues - namely, Nash's affairs and his fondness for having sex with men in public places. This, I suppose, in the context of a Hollywood commercial movie is almost tolerable, but with all the compliments to Russell Crowe's performance? The man seems to just move, holding the briefcase and wearing a dirty hat and somehow that seems to qualify as good acting? Anyone who has ever met a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is uncaring. It's also quite offensive. And I dare say, just the right side of being truly terrible
