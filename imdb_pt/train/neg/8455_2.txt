"Arahan" does not add anything positive to the Kung Fu genre. Comparing this confusing movie with the inspirational madness and quality of Stephen Chow's films is a mistake. <br /> <br /> First, the fight scenes are nothing new. Everything presented here was made earlier and better by the likes of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fights in Motion Pictures smart need logic. There seems to be no point in serving blows that have no detrimental effect like the "Matrix" sequences. <br /> <br /> The attractive female protagonist, So-Yi Yoon, captivated the screen, but never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role. Ziyi Zhang did this easily in "House of Flying Daggers". Having a martial arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies. Forming inexperienced actors in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in "Asumi"), unless you are a very talented director who, like "Arahan", proves that Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
