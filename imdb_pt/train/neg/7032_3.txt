When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins investigating her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than "natural causes." The closer she gets to the truth, the more she becomes a threat to her sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line), and the rest of the local Satanists. They will do whatever it takes to put an end to your nosy ways. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy dark films with satanic themes, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The film is filled with nudity and soft-core ritual sex. A particular scene involving a young woman and a goat should be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the suffering in the world can not save black candles. Most of the film is total. Besides the only scene I've mentioned, the myriad sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. The performance is uneven at best. Even the favorite Helga Line genre performs disappointingly. The plot does not really matter. His main function seems to be to keep the rows of scenes of sex together bland. I'm just familiar with another film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared with their Daughters of Darkness, who masterfully mix eroticism and horror, Black Candles seems amateurish. 3/10 is about the best I can do.
