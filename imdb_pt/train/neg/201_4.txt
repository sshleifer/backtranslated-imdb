Iberia is good to see on TV. But why see it on the silver screen? Lots of dancing and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, this can be your date movie. But otherwise, an hour and a half is too long. If you like to see a skilful dance on the silver screen, it is best to see the Bollywood movie. They know how to combine the breathtaking dance with a long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to photograph the dance from the old experience. And every once in a while, it sounds pretty good. but when the movie is one and the time should be at least most of the time interesting. There are many kinds of art, not everything is bigger than life and this movie is not very big.
