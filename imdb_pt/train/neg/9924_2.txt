"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his rather unpleasant life is fairly well documented. This movie, intended to portray his life, should have used a fictional character, because superdramatized events are a very strong departure from facts and chronology. Not only that, he ignores some interesting details that other versions have included, such as the public relations fiasco in New York and his religious conversion. It is true that it was executed by Lucian, Lansky, et. al. but that's as far as it goes. The explosive scene of the dish depicting Luciano performing the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home, assisted by his own mother, is ridiculous. In addition, there is the scene in which Dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to the Legs Diamond. It just does not work. Mrs. Fleggenheimer's character does not work either. This film does not need a Jewish mother for comic relief. The idiotic representation of Legs Diamond was humorous. I'm sure the man is turning into his grave. And by the way, Dutch actually killed people in person, but it was not Rambo or 007. The scene in which he erases the brewery is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it was a comedy and I just did not get it.
