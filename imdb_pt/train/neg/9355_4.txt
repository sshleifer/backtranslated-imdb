I've only recently been able to follow the films of Marilyn Miller since they are not showing up at TCM in the UK. I've been very intrigued over the years because this was one of the 20 year old superstars. What did she really like? For some stars of this time like Jolson, some of the magic still shines, but not for Miller. Her dance seems strange and poorly choreographed, her singing is somewhat limited and, as an actress, makes Ruby Keeler look like Hepburn. this movie as the audience got tired of musicals virtually all the musical numbers were deleted. So we got a comedy from that period with little real appeal. He was getting paid $ 500,000 for this! So I have only two conclusions. Either she was poorly served by the movies or she had no talent. I think the truth is closer than the last.
