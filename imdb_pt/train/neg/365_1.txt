Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, stupid direction, the annoying porn soundtrack that perpetuated the exaggerated script, and a bad copy of VHS can not be rescued by drinking alcohol. Trust me because I put this turkey to the end. It was so pathetically bad that I had to find out that it was a fourth-rate satire from Springtime to Hitler. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only spark of interest, and that was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something similar, but a thousand times better, then watch Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.
