Yes, I rated this movie as a horrible star. However, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies from now on. This is so bad that it's good. This is another production by K. Gordon Murray (read: you buy a really cheap / bad Mexican film, you get zero in money by getting the nickname in English and you throw it in children's matins in the mid-60s.) It's a shame that I've stumbled so late life as I'm sure some "mood enhancers" would make this an even better experience. I will not repeat what many of the other reviewers have already said, a Christmas movie with Merlin, the Devil, reindeer and some of the most pathetic children actors I have ever seen. I plan to do this during the holiday season with "A Christmas Carol" by Kelsey Grammar. Truly a holiday experience made in hell. Now, if I can find only "To All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on DVD, I'll have a triple feature that can not be beat. You have to see this movie. It moves so slowly that I challenge you not to touch the fast forward button - especially in the two dance routines! This thing smells like an expensive bleu cheese-think you have to pass the stench to enjoy the experience. Merry Christmas, friends!
