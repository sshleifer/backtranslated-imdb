First of all, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be in place in a vampire movie. Along with the other not-so-interesting characters and the poor plot, the whole film becomes predictable. If you keep that in mind and are a total fan of vampire movies, you can have fun with some of the scenes. Do not expect Tarantino-style chapters here and not a plot by Anne Rice. (I hope I've forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow;)
