This is a rather sweet compliant part of World War II codes being broken, stolen, and so on. The performance is about what I expected from this cast of MGM "B" actors. <br /> <br /> A great caution. Jean Rogers, who did a great job playing sexy Dale Arden on Flash Gordon's first two shows, is horrible in that movie. Your character is extremely annoying. She absolutely never lets up with her overacting. We must believe that during the height of a world war, in what would obviously be an extremely secret code installation, she would be allowed to enter and leave any office of her choice, although she has no official function. From that point of view, I'm sorry for watching this movie. This has forever changed my perception of Miss. Rogers. Talentwise, she's a lightweight. <br /> Lee Bowman is your usual self, which means he's just adequate. <br /> <br />
