This has to be the worst piece of crap I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I would like to know that he and Naomi Watts are a real-life item because I spent two of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in it. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the shaggy beard and the deer headlights around him, I can not say I agreed. Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked like he could not wait to get off the set. <br /> <br /> Should I feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a long way from Butch Cassidy, which was actually a funny movie. This was banal, clich√© and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It was not. <br /> <br /> The last 10 to 15 minutes were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are hiding in a border hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. This is not funny. But it was funny when they left the hotel with the armor, because all we could think of was the Black Knight of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say "I'm going to bite your leg!" We were howling with laughter, as were several other distorted members of the audience. When we left, almost everyone was talking about the time waster this movie was. <br /> <br /> I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (preview), but it certainly was not free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never go back.
