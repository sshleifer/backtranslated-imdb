Kids boring fantasy that gives the star of Joan Plowright billing, but little to do. Guilty children pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (yuk) while best friend Hazel runs for mayor - she's 13! Totally pedestrian in every way, plus the added disadvantage of the girls' honeyed performances as well as the baseball kids. Certainly a minor effort for Showtime --- no limits?
