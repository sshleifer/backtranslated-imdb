If Ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery, still prevalent in third world countries, the film could have been better received. Instead, it turns into a star-studded disaster of a movie in which the stars entered, said their lines, and took their wages without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations. World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa. Next comes Peter Ustinov, who can barely gather enough ham to be part of the role of Muslim slave trader. As Johnson is black, he picks her up anyway with a lot of kids and some adults as well. <br /> Of course, Caine does not accept the kidnapping and the rest of the movie is spent in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast have people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian movie star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Usually something like this talented staff. like those mentioned above, will exaggerate and feast on the landscape. But Ashanti does not even have that to happen. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The scent of tax cuts is permeating the air.
