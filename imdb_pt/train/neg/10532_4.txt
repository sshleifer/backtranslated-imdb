Madison is not too bad - if you fancy simplistic, non-offensive, "family friendly" fare, and more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane runs. If, like me, you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., get ready to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have commented on the subject at length. stereotypical nature of the film and its propensity to use every banal sports clich√© in the book. I do not need to repeat what they said. What I felt was missing, unfortunately, was any sense of real excitement of unlimited hydro races in the "glory years" (which many would argue had already passed in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roar along course six, although it was clear that the restored versions (hats for volunteers at the Seaplane Museum and the Race Boat) were being tended by scenes at low speed. But where was the sound? Much of the excitement of the old hydroelectric plants was the roar of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin engines, finished by RPMs that were never imagined by their designers, reaching the starting line right in front of them. You did not hear it, you felt it. Real hydro buffs know exactly what I'm talking about. There is none of this in Madison. Instead, each race scene is buried under what is supposedly a "heroic" soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And then there are the close-up photos of the riders, walking smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the last luxury limousines, in some cases taking the time to grin evil while contemplating the best way to thwart the poor hometown hero. Or, in a particularly ridiculous shot, taking time to see Jake Lloyd giving a "Rocky" salute from a bridge pier. In fact, some unlimited drivers wore fireproof vests to minimize the beating they carried when boats battled hard water at speeds above 150mph. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer put it so well, "The sport deserves better than that." <br /> <br /> Finally, once another user brought anachronisms, I will add one: Seattle shows the Kingdome Field and Safeco. Neither of these existed in 1971
