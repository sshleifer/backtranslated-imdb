This movie smells bad. I do not think I've ever seen a movie so full of shock value. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the acting was bland. This could have been a good movie. I think it was based only on grotesque visuals. I can usually deal with graphic scenes and human taboos, but Miike seems to have shot him. Just a badly executed movie. There is simply nothing to be entertained watching this movie, unless you are fascinated by getting tired of explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-milking, parental and sibling abuse, and fecal dispersal. I think I just sold the movie to many of you, but I meant it when I said that it smells bad. He got other movies, but I think you'd better watch someone pooping.
