The problem with THE CONTRACTER is summed up by the opening scene. The CIA wants a dead international terrorist, so get in touch with the black assassin James Dial. The terrorist is appearing at the Old Bailey court in London which raises the question: why do they want to get rid of a terrorist if he will spend the rest of his life in jail? It will be out of circulation anyway. Did not the CIA have a chance before being arrested? If by chance he receives a verdict of innocence, kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who will spend his life in a maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Since the premise defines the story, an audience may choose to ignore the plot hole, but the aggression itself pours over fire. Dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the cab is driving in bumps, but Dial manages to escape. So the police were close enough to shoot someone, but too far to arrest someone from a car accident? The movie of this kind of plot connivance. Later, Dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying "this airport is surrounded by armed police", but Dial manages to escape very easily without explanation. The whole movie fools your audience by counting on things that are never explained. This includes an important supporting character named Emily Day. Why does she help Dial, although he is a sought-after fugitive? Your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty bad thriller and is not accepted by the cast of "big names." Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a movie star, but he killed his career starring in more and more inconsequential movies. Charles Dance also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3 but again he is someone best known for appearing live on DVD nowadays and he is basically playing a special role anyway. The likes of Lena Headey can become great moviegoers, but they certainly will not be able to put THE CONTRACTER on their resume
