I saw this movie the other night. I can not even begin to express how much this movie sucked. The writing, the dubbing, even the claymation. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span because of the comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls on every possible spot. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie's animation is of very poor quality. I know this is a movie made by one person, but to think he could do 97 minutes of shit, maybe he could at least make a second value of funny. <br /> <br /> This show can take the movie. cake for being the worst movie of all time. Yikes It really was that bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, avoid this abomination. My advice: do not even buy it, or search for it. Your brain will be than you.
