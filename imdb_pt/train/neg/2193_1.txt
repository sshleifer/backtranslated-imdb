A mad scientist friend is decapitated, so he brings his head back to life. Honestly this is the plot of the movie. He tries to get another body looking in the city area for that perfect body. For some reason, he has an ugly monster in a closet in his cabin. The sleaze style of the movie is laughable. No one in the movie can really act including the head. The closet monster is a man with a tie mask and you can actually tell. The plot is slow, weak and the ending is so poorly done. Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this motion. Believe me, I did not watch this movie alone.
