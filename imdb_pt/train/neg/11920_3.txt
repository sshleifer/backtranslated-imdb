Oscar Wilde's comedy of manners, perhaps the most sagacious piece ever written, is almost destroyed in the hands of a second-rate cast. Sanders is, as one would expect, casually, indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain tries an accent on alternative phrases and the other cast members seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; in fact, the whole production has bookshelves that reduce the tragedy - no doubt the Hays office insisted. The direction of Preminger seems to be mainly in ensuring that there are many servants and even the music seems banal. Stay with the silently visually perfect farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try to read the piece for the pleasure of words. But skip this version.
