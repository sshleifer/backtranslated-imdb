I just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with, I was still disappointed. The most blatant mistake in this abomination of a movie is that the main point of the plot (the guy who was awake during the surgery), had NOTHING to do with the result. It would have ended the same way regardless. So what was the point of this? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had four negligence lawsuits against him and he did not think people would ask if a patient died at his desk? Give me some time. Jessica Alba is completely without talent and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was laughable from start to finish. I'm pretty sure that if you feel someone cutting your chest with a scalpel, you'd feel more pain than that.
