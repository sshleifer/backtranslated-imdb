The Hazing is a confusing mumbo-jumbo who wants both to be The Evil Dead who even references Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is that it's simply not in the same league as that fantastic movie. This movie is far from original. The plot was used before, by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons, and that was a lot more fun. This movie loses a lot of time with a complicated exposition before putting the kids in the scary mansion and starting the demonic happenings. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourif, as always, does not have much to do here, but when he's on screen he puts on another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As for the children's acting, it is acceptable but not good. Unstable camera work is more irritating than smart or atmospheric. There are some good times when the first guy is possessed and throws some mortals while dispatching his victims, but it has never been scary for a second. The blood level is medium to low, but the director tries to make up for it by showing the topless actresses a few times. All in all, fine if you have 87 minutes to lose.
