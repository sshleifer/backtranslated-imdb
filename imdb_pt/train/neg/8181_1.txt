I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata (Argentina) festival ... I just could not watch it! I had to cover my eyes after the first half of Cutting Moments and take a look from time to time. When it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt slightly bent. I just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the start of the second short (BTW, of course I was not the only one left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed by the many brave people who really loved it. I do not understand how you can love this kind of movie! The shocking, bloody, horrible images I saw were really stuck in my head for two days! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw the whole thing and told me about it) and I just do not think it makes any sense. I mean, this amount of violence and other things makes no sense but trying to shock people. And that's not a good enough reason, I guess. There's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say "Well, at least 'x' was good." But well, I do not think I'll ever understand this kind of movie.
