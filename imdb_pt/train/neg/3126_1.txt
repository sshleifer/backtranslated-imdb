Mr. VanHook had a good idea and kicked like a soccer ball. Unfortunately, it was not the goal. The historical theme of the giants is fine, but pour the goat's milk and you end up with a giant cheese wheel. I say, take this spool wheel and roll it off a cliff. I could not even watch the whole movie. That says a lot because I rarely get out of any movie. I always like to give them a chance for last-minute redemption. It is impossible to rescue something so bad. Well, at least the performance was good ... NO! <br /> <br /> The only thing "falling" in this movie is the rating. 1/10 and sinking into the negative numbers!
