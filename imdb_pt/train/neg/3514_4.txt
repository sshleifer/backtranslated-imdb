Philip. Film by K. Dickian. And decent for that matter. Better than the Paycheck (Woo) and that abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's face it, the final twisting and cheesing was a little too much for me. In the middle of the movie I already started to fear about this kind of ending, and I was sadly right. But that does not mean the movie is not worth it. No, not at all. First semester (as many have commented here) is incredible. There are parts in which you begin to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that charisma is a very important thing in the future (we will do those nasty things because WE CAN) or it is simply more than a combination. But paranoia is present and also "out of the ordinary". A good.
