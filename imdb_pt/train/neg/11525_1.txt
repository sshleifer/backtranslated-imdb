Simply terrible! Why would not you use real actors? Look, this has to stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want some credibility or any message sent through these low budget movies ... please God's love uses real actors! Most will work for free ... enjoy it! Now, back to my review ... anyway, the mood was smaller than the bath variety and it was not funny on any level. As for the quality ... in a scene filmed on a public transport bus you can see the reflection of the crew ... guess what? It was a guy with what looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I suppose the only audience for this movie are people with a blood fetish ... and it was not even a good one.
