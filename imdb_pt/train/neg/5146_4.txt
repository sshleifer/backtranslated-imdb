for a long time I was anxious to see this movie, here in Latin America or in Eastern movies has no distribution in theaters, we can find some of these movies in some underground stores, and I just found Avalon, I was expecting something good but the only good thing about this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and meaningless, just stupid, with lots of useless scenes and a boring story. I'm wasting my time writing about this movie. Sorry, but it's the truth.
