The week before my visit to Iowa, I saw the School of Confidential Art, in which a pretentious student makes a film and can not decide whether it is art or violent exploitation. Iowa could be the movie he made. I can see much better movie elements in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, in addition to artiness, both films had good character development and consistent story lines. Iowa This movie stumbles into an absurd ending. I have to admit it had consistency. This movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better anywhere. All the actors did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves better. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why does she have to demonstrate this in this little ball.
