I've seen a lot of Guy Maddin movies, and I liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. The John Gurdebeke edition is too frantic, and in addition to a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads pointing at an object, does not interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience. Another thing I did not like about this movie was that it looked more brutal than Maddin's earlier works - although his films always had obscure elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the films a primordial feeling of humanity . It seemed more harshness through roughness. <br /> <br /> As I'm forced to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my review, I'll mention that the actor who plays "Guy Maddin" can not simulate his facial expressions well.
