Many people see this as a classic, but I obviously must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas, in the early 1950s, is very monotonous - which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas, in the early '50s, will be boring too! What do so many people see in this? Once the last photo in Anarene closes, there will be nothing to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But even before closing there is not much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans on how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some equally bored adults in town. You see, there is not much for them to do - except to have sex (sometimes with one another and sometimes with bored teenagers) or to complain about the local school football team. Three times something happened that I thought of adding some spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing happens because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) run away, but nothing happens because of this, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens by cause of it. The one thing that added something of dramatic value to the film came at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), who really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, while men stand around looking at the body debating where to go to the breakfast. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is supposed to show how gray this city is, but the only thing I found interesting was the initial view of actors like Bottoms, Pastor , Bridges and Randy Quaid. (As an aside, it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - really resembles his Primo Eddie character in the National Lampoon Vacation movies.) Classic? I think not! 3/10
