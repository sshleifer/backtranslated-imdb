I love Clash music and I love the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind it. But I left the theater without knowing much more about Joe than I ever did after reading the entry on Wikipedia. The film never really reaches the person, their thoughts and feelings. What they did was collect the material they had, shake videos and interview some people about Joe Strummer at a campfire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or nothing, and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have more celebrities say, "Oh, he was an inspiration to us all." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (whom they apparently asked to keep their pirate costume to benefit from their current success in Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems the director could not even wait until the body was cool before jumping to sell his version of the "best punk rocker and heart hippie" that ever existed, sanctifying the person without knowing enough about it. <BR> Of course, being a fan I enjoyed seeing the pictures of the band, listening to the stories behind the songs and such but in the end I felt like what remained as the picture of Joe Strummer could be easily counted in 60-90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go see the movie if you are a fan, otherwise better listen to some Clash songs or even better the undeservedly unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the pinnacle of his musical development before his death, melting all its rich influences together with an incredible sound.
