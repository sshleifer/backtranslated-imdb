I totally agree with another reviewer here who was pleased "For the Birds" won the Oscar in 2002 for "Best Animated Short", not this sick stuff, which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone, of course, who does not has a belief in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but there are also many animated short films. And by the way, I love black humor, but that was not at all attractive from the start. <br /> <br /> As for the story here: a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but gray (symbolism here) is told by a television set (which appears at intervals of a few hundred meters) that he is in the paradise, hell or purgatory. Each time he puts a gun on his head and shoots after hearing the news. I think it would be funny in two out of three cases.
