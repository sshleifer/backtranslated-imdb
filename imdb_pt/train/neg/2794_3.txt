Well, because I'm a musician, I thought, maybe I'll check out this movie on TMC, nothing better. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it's only half. I seriously thought it was one of those softcore movies with horrible plot and lousy acting, bad footage and bad effects. But no, I do not even have the pleasure of it. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping for maybe a few laughs, but I was not sure if they were trying to play at once or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest only until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I can sit here typing until I have 10 lines
