I'm going to spend as much time in this review as the writers did in the script. This is easily the worst sequel I've ever done. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's GOD-AWFUL performance, just like everyone else !! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script appears to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How producers have managed to squeeze such vile cinematic droppings is beyond me. They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like an untalented clown. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> I want the 96 minutes of my life to go by watching this memory of a brilliant comedy, so that I can try to convince everyone involved by this cinematic atrocity.
