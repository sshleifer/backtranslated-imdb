The only reason this movie is rated 1 is that zero is not one of the selection options. With a finer plot than the depression era cabbage soup, horrible performance and special effects that seem to have come out of the TV series "Thunderbirds," it's incredible that Widmark did not kill the director by putting that black mark on your resume. Even in the 1950s, the special effects are atrocious, except for some underwater sequences. I can only assume that it was nominated for the best special effects, because, except for 20,000 Leagues Underwater and THEM!, There was no one else making effects. It certainly was not a contest for Disney that year if it was their only competition. I would not recommend the film, even for fans of underwater movies, because the more realistic scene of the submarine was limited to a shot where seawater can be seen dribbling the raised periscope. There are other very sub better movies that you can take advantage of this time, like the 20,000+ leagues mentioned above or Torpedo Run.
