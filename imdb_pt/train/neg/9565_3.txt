I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, since it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say that it's the most transparent film I've ever seen. Not once did a plot device come forward without me guessing this 10 + minutes in advance. There was no subtlety about the film, no obvious intelligence behind the scenes. All the spoken or typed intent was so obvious that it was impossible to "get" into the movie. <br /> <br /> I found myself laughing at the terribly thoughtful plot, and the frustrated attempts to recover the audience, much more often than I found myself enjoying the film.
