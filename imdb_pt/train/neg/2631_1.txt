One butt gives Secret Serviceman a tip about a Secret Service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president. Baloney. How did the hobo know? The script then turns into a more detailed examination of how the Secret Service works, but who cares. Most of this only slows down the movie. All the persecutions that follow are the version of this movie of the tiresome pursuits of cars of many films. So, after too much impossible athletics where our hero surpasses and surpasses all his friends, we have a shootout at Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly marked with maple leaves, but how did they get into it? Finally, everything is settled. But it still does not make sense.
