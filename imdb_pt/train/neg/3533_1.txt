Let this movie serve as the death knell for the "big-turn" movies of the 1990s. Known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome, this slight cinematic touch has already been made to death by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation on A BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna"), uses the Soze motif in a much more obsequious way. Jason Statham (with a highly objectionable head of hair) stars as Jack Green (known to everyone as "Mr. Green".) He may or may not be the mentor of the crime, Mr. Gold. Or, perhaps, Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit who can have members of the underworld. I'm not sure, but I certainly do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most exaggerated examples of the cinematic excess I have had the dislike of enduring in a long time. Witness the structure of fractured time, the painful jumping cuts, the incessant interior monologues and the painfully pretentious animated sequence. This style of steering "everything and the kitchen sink" makes the work of Quentin Tarantino look serene. The cinematographic smoke and the mirrors only lead me to believe that Ritchie was as bored telling this trite story as I was watching. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking, but they only come as news to Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green, as I always like Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he fights as a remedy reader in an English Literature class at the University. His lack of intelligence is only offset by the lack of restraint shown by his enemy, Macha (Ray Liotta). Banking with a scene like a hungry man at a banquet, Liotta spits, cries and fumbles through the film in an embarrassing display of exaggerated, leopard-print speedos. <br /> <br /> There are no redeeming qualities for REVOLVER. It's more of a faux pas than Ritchie's film and may even surpass his remake of SWEET AWAY as his worst movie so far.
