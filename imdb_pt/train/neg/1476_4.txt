This somewhat stereotypical swords and a movie of flying fists is a decent initial demonstration of John Woo's talents. The cinematography is excellent and part of the work with the sword is truly remarkable. Unfortunately, the film works under the weight of a monotonous story and an extremely low budget (check out some of the fight scenes if you doubt me). However, it is worth seeing, especially if you can get in letterboxed.
