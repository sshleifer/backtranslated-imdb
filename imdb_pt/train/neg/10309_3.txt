"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolutely horrible film from Luc Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is basically about a woman who is taken and trained by the CIA and is forced to make a secret mission for them. (Almost the same story structure as La Femme Nikita) The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in movie history. Lamas's acting is simply an imitation of Steven Segal. Watching Orenthal's act in this film is an excruciating experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting are so bad in this movie that it is sometimes laughable. There are so many conventions of action movies in the movie that it's ridiculous: unnecessary car blasts, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, bad horsetails, etc. The musical score resembles David Michael Frank's score for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which promotes the Steven Segal theme of this film. There are many martial arts in the film, and it is very well done for a low budget American production. Foolish action and superior acting never give up, and I have to admit that I felt slightly amused. Lorenzo Lamas had the appearance of an action star in the early 1990s, but he certainly is not an action star, that's why he's making soap operas and not blockbusters of action. My recommendation is that you skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and check out "La Femme Nikita".
