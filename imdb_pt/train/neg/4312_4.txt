It acts as a satire during the era of the women's rights movement. Of course, that does not mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold. It works in the same vein as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still tame), and is basically a standard fare pattern. What I mean for this movie to be uninteresting is simple to recognize. Anyone who completes a normal time in a normal job, training a lot of lunatics who earn their way to a sudden victory, makes the waste. It's the same feeling you can have after watching it. A good attempt to choose the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I expected better things.
