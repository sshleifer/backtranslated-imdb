Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he had seen Gruner, which he called a good science fiction film, Nemesis. So while watching this, we quickly find ourselves in the midst of the dramatic parts of BS just to come up with the unbelievable action sequences. Gruner likes to kick and kick and kick. And kick it! haha <br /> <br /> The Gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto next to where he grew up. He finds himself watching the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join him. in the Mexican gang that continues to torment his family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (against a gang? Very crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone (or who maim a lot) and works to rid his gang of these gangs. <br /> <br /> The plot was very tacky and easy to think about. Gruner is probably not much known because of his choice of script if this movie is something to compare possible choices. This ghetto is hell and I enjoyed seeing the heterogeneous team of characters passing by as if they had a chance against Gruner's character. The music was typical of action music (pianos and high timbals, swollen guitars) which was not really as bad as I sounded. The director really needed to keep the action instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family time. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave it a 4/10 because it actually tried to be a medium-action movie. for Oliver Gruner to star in, but the overall feel of the movie leaves you wanting more closure than you just saw.
