I liked this movie, but Van Damme does the same old junk from time to time. Poo knickers fight scenes as per generally. The only thing this loser left out was that the Russians end up being killed in the end. This film is a complete doggy do of the highest nature, please, please, please Van Damme get some acting classes, you need them. Anyone who likes Van Damme has problems, it seems sad that Van Damme's only way to get some acting work is when he writes the film, co produces the film and makes the screen for the film. AVOID DAMME VAN AND ITS PERFECT NASTY WIG WEAR. I give this movie a two out of ten, because the one with the sandman was better. To add insult to injury I wasted a quid on this manure
