This comedy of service, to which Peter Marshall (brother of Joanne Dru and later perennial host of The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan were exalted as "the new Lewis and Martin" is just shy: some random hints are inserted, all speak fast and nothing works very well - there's a scene where Noonan is throwing grenades at angry officers and politicians; they are separated by a meter and a half, Noonan throws them in the middle, and the total reaction is that all recoil. In the midst of a horror relieved only by Julie Newmar's quest, there are some moments of clarity: Marshall and Noonan engage in hollow bouts of idle chatter and argumentation, and their timing is almost perfect - clearly, they were a couple of really sharp comedy. <br /> <br /> Not enough to save that turkey, unfortunately.
