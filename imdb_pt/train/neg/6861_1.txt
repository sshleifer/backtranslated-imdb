My first exposure to the Templars and not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offers from Anchor Bay Video, which brought us other cult classics like "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but this by itself can not hide the fact that the film is deathly monotonous. There is an exciting opening sequence in which the villagers make a terrible revenge against the Templars (and put everything in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, cumbersome, and ultimately unsatisfying. Adding insult to injury: the film was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised in the video jacket.
