A below-average-looking video game is turned into a kind of conspiracy for the next terrorist to be discovered in the US backyard. Welcome to the madness of making cheap direct to video movies. It is full of nameless actors and actresses with little valuable plot. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this strange game continues and our "hero" bets on real money and does good on it. It's kind of a game, except the part of the game is gone and sucks. Instead, it's an online game with little real value and you get authorities at your limit if you do good. <br /> <br /> What makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle in some way and everything is saved in the end. I will leave the viewer to see how everything is achieved. <br /> <br /> Overall, neither is it worth renting $ 1. Borrow, please. "D-"
