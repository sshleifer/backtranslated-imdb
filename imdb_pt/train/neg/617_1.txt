First, let me start with a quote that a friend of mine said while watching this movie: "This entire movie had to be a challenge. You know, like, 'DUDE, I COULD NOT MAKE THE WORST FILM EVER.'" With this film, they made a good effort to achieve that title. The effects are obviously bad. The plot / dialogue is like a collage of pieces stolen from all the B horror films ever made. The actors, I suppose, must be in college. However, parts of it (especially in the beginning) make it seem like they should be in high school. It makes no sense. The Scarecrow that circulates killing people is not at all pleasant. (SPOILER: At the end, when they sing Lester's name and he reappears, the black guy and the Scarecrow are laughing, probably for the sake of being in their last scene, and in the cheesy dialogue.)
