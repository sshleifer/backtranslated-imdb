Where to begin to describe the complete misery of Neil LaBute's latest attempt to make movies? <br /> <br /> There are many types of movie buffs out there, but by far the most annoying and superficial is Mr. Intriguing. You know Mr. Intriguing, do not you? <br /> <br /> He's the guy that no matter how stupid, lame and incomprehensibly boring a movie is, he says, "Gee, I do not know why everyone hated, I found it intriguing." He's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing. Especially when he passes the finger in the shape of a Hitler's mustache on his upper lip and marches on the house talking about the glow of science fiction that presents veiled references to Greek mythology. He is also the guy for whom this version of The Wicker Man was made. No one else could bear this.
