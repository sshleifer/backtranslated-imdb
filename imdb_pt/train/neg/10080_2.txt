I had to do a research on the actresses to find the advice of this movie because the title is now an unexpected love. Not worth looking for, but I was not familiar with the two leads and wondered why they were heading a lesbian movie in Lifetime. Everything is pretty tight and you have no idea who these characters are, so as a viewer, I was not able to get emotionally involved in the plot. I guess I'm not the target audience for this, but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is soft and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing is very interesting. I had a lascivious interest in seeing two women kissing, but this was treated so discreetly that I was disappointed. Rent the Personal Best instead.
