Okay, I bought this Woolworths movie for my friend for a joke present on his birthday because the cover had a sexual innuendo on it. <br /> <br /> But we decided to watch anyway. Just for the purpose of hilarity. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but this has to be one of the worst movies ever. <br /> <br /> It all started well, and we thought "Okay, this may really be OK". But after about 10 minutes, we were sadly mistaken. <br /> <br /> It started when the "mysterious bullet painter" turned out to be the most obvious character, the Scouser / Australian (I say this because he had an accent). that could not be identified), who is acting, I could say, was lousy. <br /> <br /> Then it came to an end, and by that time we all lost the will to live. The finals of the ink ball. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this plot is that they did not win, but annoyingly they won by default. <br /> <br /> And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name the team received was horrible. Critical damage. I mean, they could pick a more incredible name, like "The Destroyers of the Antichrist" or something. Or that's what the movie should be called anyway.
