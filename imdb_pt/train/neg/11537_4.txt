I'd been following the progress of this movie for some time, so maybe I'd wait a little too long. I think both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer are good at what they do and were interested in seeing what Dan Reed could invent, but unfortunately that just did not work for me. The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand what genre is falling and as such can not impress in elements of drama, terror and suspense because instead of focusing on one them and do it well is a bit all trades and no one's master. The premise (as with most revenge movies) is simple, couple meets and leaves, something bad happens and they take revenge is a simple formula and that many directors have skillfully dealt with over the years . Unfortunately, in this case, it's as if Dan Reed thought, "It would be great to do one of those revenge movies that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side of all the characters and investigating their mental state in more detail ..." Wrong! There are also some missing key elements, in this type of movie there is usually some kind of warning. The do not do this or this can happen element that increases the voltage but there is nothing of the kind here. It just happens, so nothing happens for an hour, so something interesting happens and then it ends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of competition in this genre and hats for Dan Reed to try, I have no problems with his driving skills but in terms of writing ... I would say next time he should follow the formula for the kind of movie you are making, instead of trying to be too clever and he will have a quality movie on your resume. hands.
