If it were not for some gullible and immature idiot, I know that, insisting that I watch this documentary, I would never have seen this comedy! This movie is full of script mistakes and laughable moments. One in particular is where Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for filming on the streets while they allow the cameraman to continue filming his prison and then leave, still filming, presumably for his luxurious hotel. Then there is the scene in which a car crashes into another car that has been turned upside down and parked right on the roadside without any evidence of being in an accident or explosion. <br /> I'm currently surprised to have the rating it has (5.8 / 10). I thought the IMDb users had more sense.
