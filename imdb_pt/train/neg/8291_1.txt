A dull dentist discovers that his wife has been unfaithful. So there are no new story lines here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid and disgusting movie. If you enjoy seeing children vomiting, or seeing a dentist imagining that he is taking all of his wife's teeth in a kind of bloody terror, go see (or rent) the movie. If not, move on to something else (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?)
