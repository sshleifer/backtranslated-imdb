Marilyn Miller made only three films before her untimely death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY OF LOVE (1931) and this trifle - SUNNY (1930). She is very poor, both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - although she has four dance numbers, she only sings two songs (WHO? AND ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score, including the title song of spritely, is discarded, although we may hear the latter in the background score. Miller looks obese and overweight here - no star quality. Even her dance is shocking. The film is very poorly written, stock full of old and bland jokes and stupid situations. If you are interested in Miller as an artist, please check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.
