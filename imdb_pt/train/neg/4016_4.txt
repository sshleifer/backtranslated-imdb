There is a DVD published in the UK in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the cover, without ASIN, VFC 19796 on disk, no IFPI code on the inner ring. Probably a direct transfer from VHS. <br /> <br /> There is not much sense in commenting on an adult movie. But it contains a minimal plot, and the characters are believable. It was shown in the United States in regular cinemas. <br /> <br /> I've seen In Pensylvannia in 1975. <br /> <br /> As such, it deserves a place in a Movie Encyclopedia. . The DVD has no special features and no subtitles, and was probably made using a VHS tape as a source
