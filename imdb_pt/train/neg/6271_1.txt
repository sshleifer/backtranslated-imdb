There are no words to explain how bad the NightMare weekend is. It just defies description. Something about a computer that can turn personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouths, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so strange that it's impressive. There is also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer speaks through a hand puppet !!!!!!!! I am not making this up. The computer also controls things like cars, even if there is nothing connecting the computer to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> The "movie" is total rubbish. Bad junk surreal. Spectacularly, a crap. There are many sex scenes played here and there that are not too hot or erotic. There is even a scene where a woman apparently makes love or wants to kiss a French tarantula, which made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Upstairs, with the equally unfair video straight home, BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch and try to understand what's going on.
