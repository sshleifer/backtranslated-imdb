This movie is another excellent example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since 1997, seems to be the best in - to show a movie before its release and not to have a quality movie. I'm not movie critic, but this movie was as predictable as they come. Every attempt at a joke, every attempt at a touching moment, and the pitiful attempt at a love story were exactly what I was anticipating in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this.
