Am I wrong or is the 2007 version just a copy of the original? I have to ask why the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad acting, poor editing etc .... the only aspect of "holding" here is how we were stolen for it our money by buying this piece of crap. It's nothing more than a lightweight pornographic film ... no blood, no scary images, just a little cheap junk. If anyone wants to see a great movie with no known actors, something sticky and a decent storyline ... get Baby Blood ... also made with a cheap budget but well done ... and a real story too! I Spit was a waste of money, but I'll keep it just for a laugh ... it's pathetic! New comment .... September 03 ..... I will keep this movie forever just because it is so bad that it is almost good .... in a very bad way .... the worst acting ever .. a real crap classic!
