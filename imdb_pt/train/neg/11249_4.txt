Visually stunning? Definitely. I have seen some very good movies at some point. Captain Sky and Tomorrow's World uses stunning cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic design to create a world that is historically familiar, but it's something quite new. The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 1940s. The film chronicles the recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies that stole generators and the like for some unexplained reason. In addition, mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide. Who can stop them and save the world? Okay, it does not take much faith to know that it's Sky Captain himself, with his clever girlfriend reporter, always encouraged by a leadership, and behind the scenes, his faithful and competent partner. What Sky Captain has in the atmosphere and in the graphics, is lacking in narrative and characterization. The plot for this movie is ridiculous. That said, the movie is heading for a serial feeling from past movie series. They had very distant stories and bad performances - but none of them, and I mean any of them, had the budget and big names that this movie had. Two Academy Award-winning artists and Jude Law could keep a movie afloat, one might think, but Captain Sky sinks miserably. Despite his fantastic dark look, I found myself wishing the movie was over and I could go on with my life. I had little interest in a story that generated little interest. I did not care about any of the portraits. Paltrow was simply awful. Jolie was a joke with a role virtually without substance. The law can not carry the tradition of a single line on your limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, not even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Captain Sky, at least to me, was that he was very promising and yet it was very little. I was bored ten minutes into the movie - waiting for something to connect my interest - and never came.
