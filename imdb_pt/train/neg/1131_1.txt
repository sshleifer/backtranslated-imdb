Too bad even a talented director, Desplechin, could not perform a decent performance of a talented actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn does not have the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot. In an attempt to fill the concentric circle of an actor's suffering, performance and presentation are too complicated and poorly executed to attract any compassion from the viewer. In an excessively long time, the redundancy of Ester's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the plot to a frail picture of a disastrous showing. The content is incoherent and free when Phoenix struggles to execute Desplechin's instructions, just as Esther is supposedly trying to do the same. Never feeling a convincing win over Esther's pain, we've never felt a victory in Phoenix's talent.
