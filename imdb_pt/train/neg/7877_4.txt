The creators of this film have created a future where not only abortion and birth control are illegal in all states, but women are prosecuted for murder and sent to long prison sentences. In other words, this movie is the Liberals' worst nightmare! Political agenda is so heavy here and the style of the film is so discreet that it only loses steam very quickly. Regardless of which side of the fence you are in, I recommend ignoring it.
