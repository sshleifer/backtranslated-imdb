Okay, if you saw The Ring, you basically saw The Grudge. He's trying to be scary by having a weird camera job and loud sounds, but fails miserably. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and quite full of holes, for example, how would the service center know that Yoko did not show up to work when the people who lived in the house were not there? And it's not very clear what Bill Pullman's character had to do with anything. He kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It did not make much sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the bedroom, the boy or the father? And Yoko was alive or dead when the call center guy found her? There were many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think more about it.
