No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one. While this film is not without its interesting elements (hells, etc.), it is overcome by failures. On the one hand, Angela, the murderous counselor, seems about the same age as the campers. Having an older, more menacing camp director would have done a lot for the film. And then you have the murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly (no pun intended), although drowning someone in an outside bathroom is certainly original. But overall, there are a ton of movies out there that are more frightening / fun to spend an hour and a half watching over your life.
