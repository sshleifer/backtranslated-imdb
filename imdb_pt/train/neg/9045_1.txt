This film began with some semblance of plot, then abandoned it by an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with the advance of the story. It was impossible to stay involved with this movie. This film is a very cynical pile of crap made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability. It's an incredibly bad effort coming from a large studio. Clearly, there are moral and motivational issues at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of supervision and quality control. This administration allowed this film to see the light of day, talks a lot about its incompetence and despair. This movie joins my very short list of "worst movies ever".
