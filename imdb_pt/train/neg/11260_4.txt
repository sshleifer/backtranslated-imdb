This movie should be called "Plan 9 of Joseph Smith". I think your strangeness is underestimated. the playwright seems to have read "The Population Bomb (1968)" by Paul Ehrlich and produced a musical response made especially for Mormons. The main point of the play is that having as many children as possible is part of the "heavenly father" (God's) plan. and anything that prevents having more babies is too bad. Got it? <br /> <br /> This version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing. is utah, looks and looks like 1983, the play was written in 1973 and, of course, theology is part of 1840, part battlestar galactica. part of the action takes place on earth and some in the "pre-existence, an aimless room where boring children wait to pick up their bodies so they can come down and try not to knock the door on missionaries, losing the chance to be celestial glory. <br /> <br /> It's as difficult as they come, but do not let poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented Mormon universe where the 'cool kids' are all in population control, (presumably) advising their parents they did not have any more children !! having large families was, at the time the play was written, the cultural norm in the LDS community and, more importantly, considered part of God's plan. Family planning was a choice of parents, and large families were much less cultural norm now, making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modern-day Mormon! Ahhh, but it's really just as good as the song, there are some captivating songs here who do not let this movie die the death of the 1970's that was pre-intended. brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there - wink. and hard and cool children make young children look like metallica. then applause to all this! Gather the family, make some jell-o shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
