Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to see all his work. He is known for, alone, saving movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film suffers a low budget and the production values ​​are disturbing. Please ... for Christopher's sake ... avoid this movie!
