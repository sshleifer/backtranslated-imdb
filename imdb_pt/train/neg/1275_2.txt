This is a horrible movie. All three stories are grouped together with a psychiatrist hypnotist line that is unnecessary and all stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and some lady, there are some things that do not make sense, but the hypnotic thing makes up for it. The second, with the bad Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate, should not be seen by anyone. The latter, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible, which I think makes it better than the other crap.
