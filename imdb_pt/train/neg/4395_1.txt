The December holiday specials, like the original Frosty, should be richly produced with quality music and a healthy but joyful plot. They should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. Basically, they should look, sound and feel ... well, "special" and they should have a decent and appropriate holiday subtext in December. <br /> <br /> So when I saw Legend of Frosty, the snowman on TV listings, I got my kids (6 and 8) pumped into it, telling them the story of the original Frosty and passionately relating the how much I liked it when I was a child. As my wife and kids cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high but 10 minutes when my kids were yawning and my wife and I were giving each other "the look" and rolling our eyes. After 35 minutes my kids were actually asking to go to bed - I think they were fed up with insensitive language and nonsense, disconnected segments. I was really embarrassed with his (and my) disappointment with this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty, the snowman is another bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents crossed with a worse than normal episode. Bob Sponge than a classic holiday movie. Do not get me wrong ... these shows are good and I like them as much as the next, but when I watch Fairly Odd Parents or SpongeBob, my low expectations (for mediocre, off-color, zero subtext, mind numbing episodes) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We picked some good books and spent the rest of the night reading together. A far better choice than the embarrassing Legend of Frosty the Snowman.
