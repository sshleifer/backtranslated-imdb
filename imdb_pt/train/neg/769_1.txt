The big flaw in this movie is that it is impossible to believe that any of these people would ever be released in a professional production of Macbeth. Listening to David Lansbury's soft voice laboriously struggling with the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" speech made it impossible to believe anyone would consider him for the role. I kept believing, therefore, that he did not get the part because he was a lousy actor; not because a larger name was available. So when we see parts of the piece in the essay, it's hard to believe that the director is not parodying things with an irreparably misguided farce of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and the directors who see the piece through their own small talk. interpretations. Sometimes directors are so eager to have their movies made (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works) that they are content with less. This seems to be an example.
