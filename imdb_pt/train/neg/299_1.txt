This was the third remake of SLEEP WITH ENEMY After YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one who worked and it was a better movie <br /> <br /> DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan who unfortunately failed in his attempt here <br /> <br /> the story was good but the manipulation was not so good and the heroine turned out to be very regressive and the climax was also disappointing <br /> / Direction is bad Music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi reprises his role as YAARANA (strangely it was also a remake of SWTE) and seems too fat to lead and is well Juhi is decent while Arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and gets in many scenes to calm the audience but his voice was terrible Johny is very loud
