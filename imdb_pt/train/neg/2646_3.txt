When someone gets into a movie of this type of film, it is not without saying that an overdose of this great brain medicine, Suspension of Disbelief, is worth it. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna / Brigitta, the woman Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time, but who is also - an angel sent to Earth. <br /> <br /> My reaction when I saw this was a silent sigh of "Hunh?" Where did I see this before? It turns out I've seen this before, but in a movie made much later than this. DATE WITH AN ANGEL, a forgotten dreck pile made in 1987, took advantage of the ethereal beauty of an Emmanuelle Beart who had no speech, also wore a blonde wig, and made the hell Michael Knight. Much worse on all conceivable angles with ultra-low values ​​from the 1980s, but more than likely an updated version of this turkey from 1942. <br /> <br /> Anyway, not to elaborate, this is not a movie memorable and stands out as a gateway to information because it was the last time that MacDonald and Eddy, or very good actors but great singers, would be together playing the novel of "innocence" and "clean-cut" by which they were known. After that, you may need a cold shower, not because there are hot scenes here, but to get rid of memory.
