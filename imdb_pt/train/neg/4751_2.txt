First of all, when I saw the teaser trailer for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on the Disney Channel, would do martial arts and I was fine with it ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly constructed, the film could not have been reallocated to anyone, the fight was unrealistic and sucked ... along with the plot. If you really think you're an aspiring Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl who is a descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore his call and wants to become the prom queen, the observer who bothers her prepare for a great fight against some ancient evil. The idea was not so original, the movie is a waste of time.
