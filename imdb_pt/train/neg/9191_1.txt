Well, I had to sit in front of the computer and write the review immediately after watching that puddle of mud. Because? Because I have to let everyone know how bad this movie is. It's unbelievably bad. Just so you know how bad it is, I'm going to offer you that little detail about the movie. During scenes of chaos, which usually consist of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intersect scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me well. This movie really sucks. In fact, that makes me think of the fact that it costs ten dollars nowadays just to enter the theaters nowadays. And see corn crap like this? There is no story to speak of and the film basically has nothing to offer besides the occasional chest shot and really cheap deaths. I am very disappointed in this, knowing that I watched. Okay, I'm stunned. It's so bad I can not even find the words. CLASSIFICATION: ZERO out of *****.
