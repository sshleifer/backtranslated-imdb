A poorly written script with no friendly characters. As for being a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about two vain friends who do tricks to get women to bed with them (no sex scenes) and another friend (who's kind of weird) who sometimes also makes punches, but is considered the face that masterbates. The 3 friends meet and fall separately for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without any romance. The 3 guys stopped being friends while they were dating separately. She deceived them because of their friendship because they deceived the women. A bad movie
