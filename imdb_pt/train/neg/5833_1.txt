3lbs is obviously just a self-indulgent program for Stanley Tucci to be a deep / moody medical producer. Unlike House, he has absolutely no personality and, unlike Gray's Anatomy, cases of brain surgery are neither interesting. This program should be set up in a leadership center for Neurlogical cases - but there is nothing interesting or exciting going on! Not even the so-called pathetic 'fief' between him and a rival adds nothing to the spectacle and these hallucinations. In the pilot, there was a brief glimpse into the social life of the protagonists as father-snoop! boring and tasteless. <br /> <br /> This show is pants, there is an excess of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it special.
