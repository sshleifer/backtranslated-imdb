I can see girls enjoying this show, but calling this a family gig is ridiculous. I'm amazed at how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely dull and stupid show about the father of three kids who lived with his late wife's brother and his idiot friend from school, and others as the seasons continue. Every plot line usually has a really dumb lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry with another person and each episode that make up and ends with a light joke bland. As for the actors, I did not like them either. Bob Saget was painfully bland as the father with his mother's responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a 30 year old note joke that makes cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's horrible. John Stamos was the most tolerable character, but he was so clichéd that it was hard to see him. The older girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion at all. The middle girl, Stephanie, was very cliché like the cranky little sister. The youngest girl, Michelle, showed that bad actresses were the Olsen twins. You can always tell when they are turning them off. The plot lines for many story lines were so stupidly unreal that it was laughable. This is a "family" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and although they are needed for a show about a family, they overdone it. This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrible show. TVG 30 min.
