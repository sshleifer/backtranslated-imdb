Being a big fan of the "other" films PLANET OF THE APES, I rented this DVD despite my aversion to all things from Tim Burton. Again, he does not fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction. Even the makeup of the monkeys seems second-rate, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough proof). I was ashamed of such genuine talents as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Undoubtedly, the paychecks motivated them, since it could not have been the cliche script. I rented this DVD on a special $ 1 night and still feel stolen.
