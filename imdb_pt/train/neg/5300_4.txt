I'm one of millions of addicts in Columbus around the world and just watched it, the episode that started it all on British Channel 5. It's fascinating to think what came out of this movie and I can only marvel at it. who identified the enormous potential of "Columbus" and added all the little touches that make a series so wonderful and classic. That said, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode and the paternalistic British episode). If Columbo had been made according to the original 'pilot', it certainly would not have lasted long, or would be watched and loved all over the world. In this film, Lieutenant Columbo is smartly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his alleged relatives and is quite aggressive. There is also no cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbus and "the villain". Watchable, but only for the novelty of seeing how Columbus began.
