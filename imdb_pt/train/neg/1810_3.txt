Think of this movie as a Saturday morning live action show. Even the little tykes will find it hard to please because it works like molasses! I can not understand how horrible it is to do something very typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Many witch-warrior movies out there have used the same old plot many times, but this is very scarce considering their appeal to little darlings. And who in the world would have let a topless mermaid be tossed in the first place? I thought this was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another gem for your 1999 TV season!
