Extremely tedious drama starring a young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, the title Flicka, and is the only reason to watch the movie in the first place. Coated with strident and arrogant music and overwhelmed by schmaltzy dialogues, this is one of those endless movies that bore you to the point of a clumsy headache. The crisp sequel titled 'Thunderhead, Son of Flicka', in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag, is marginally better than the original, but the pace remains slow and punctuation continues to wipe you out, although there is at least one or two scenes that do not induce a coma.
