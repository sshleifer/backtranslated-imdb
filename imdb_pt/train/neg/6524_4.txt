The Quickie Review <br /> <br /> As "The Man on Planet X," this is a bizarre tale of science fiction from a time when fantasy and science fiction were still about the same thing . That is, we have some highly laughable special effects and an unbridled pseudoscience masquerading as science fiction. And yes, it's another "classic" released on a high quality transfer with a crisp picture and crisp sound - by Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So the main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's definitely the whole time our space team is on Mars. (What did you think "Angry Red Planet" referred to Neptune?) Prior to that, there is a shoddy space crew boarding a spaceship, within which they smoke and play around sexist chauvinistic games geared toward "insignificant female member". the crew. It would be a bit offensive by today's standards if it was not so funny. But Mars is the real reason we're watching this thing. The film is usually black and white, but Mars, well Mars is screaming bloody red. It is filmed in this bizarre red plastic glow giving the angry red planet an interesting appearance of overexposed redness. It's really a sight, just like the (ha ha) aliens that viewers must witness. The best is the "ratbatspidercrab". Do you think this is a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! It is a gigantic chimera (small puppet) of a thing that combines traces of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It borders on all the puppets and scares the shit out of our "heroic crew." There are other weird and ill-imagined aliens, but that's what takes the cake. Eventually, after their harrowing experience on Mars, the sexist crew embarks on their "ship" and returns to any planet they came from. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Buffs from science fiction and curious movies, and some movie fans in general. Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans will have a field day with this one (if they have never participated in the show). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern score, 6/10 Nostalgia score, 4/10 in total. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
