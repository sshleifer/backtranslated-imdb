I bought this DVD because it has kari on it and the mpaa ratings said; "Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language." <br /> <br /> which correctly, IMO, must declare; "R-score for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language." <br /> <br /> The word "sexuality" must come after a "comma," not an "e" because of the enormous difference in meaning it makes. I think many people who have watched this movie will agree with me that sexuality and nudity almost non-existent parts. my first impression when I look at the mpaa rating was that I'll be watching something like "vivid" movie. That's why I felt cheated. In terms of history, it was, after all, who really cares about the story if the beautiful kari was in it. I know I do not. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is just my opinion.
