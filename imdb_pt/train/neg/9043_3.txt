I went to see this with my wife and 3 year old son. He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and I did. The writing is surprisingly weak for a pixar / Disney tour. In fact, I had a hard time paying attention. The movie looks incredible, but the story becomes so weird and long that I expected my son to fall asleep so I could pick him up and leave. <br /> <br /> Not to say that the film is not an interesting concept, it is said so strangely, (bad script?) especially when "we meet the family" for the first time. I know we should get the impression that the family is crazy, but good sir, they could have shortened the sequence by a good 15 minutes (apparently, I did not actually time). At that moment, I was scratching my head looking for a way out.
