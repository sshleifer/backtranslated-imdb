I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great at Top Model and was very happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems to be a great guy. But this show just made me sick! I'm so angry with both of you for what happened on that show. I do not care that they have different ages, I know that age can not stay between love. But Adrianne, you've been together for SEVEN SEVEN MONTHS. It did not surprise me in all that he had not proposed. And I do not see the urge to force someone to marry you before she's ready. If it is to be, then why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other, and let that happen naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain has been completely unnecessary, it's stupidly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, what a shame you break and propose to her anyway! Have you been through two failed marriages, how could you rush into another just because she set up an attack? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the wedding was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can breathe and find the right reasons to marry within the marriage.
