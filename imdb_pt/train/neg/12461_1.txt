Unlike most other comments about "Syriana" on IMDb site, my family and I think we watch this DVD movie at home, a complete waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a movie based on a screenplay whose writer was being very clever from afar. Instead of trying to tell a complex story in a clever and clear way, it was assumed that constantly playing mostly vague and difficult to connect with each other in 30-second vignettes of different stories from a dozen " stories "the public made a great and clear visualization. No, sir, it does not. What makes a great visualization is the total clarity, precision, plots and plots - and characterizations - that have beginning, middle, and end. <br /> <br /> This kind of cinematic presentation - similar to The Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme. Thank God, then, for the TV and DVD presentations of the 1940s and 1950s Hollywood and British films, whose writers, director, and actors knew the value of clear narrative, diction, and acting meant something. <br /> <br /> This is a DVD that this family will not be sitting again.
