This movie should have portrayed a single from 'ladie's man' who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all. However, I did not care about his mission, because I did not care about his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class or charisma. He should have at least a way about himself that made the ladies weak on their knees, in addition to their saxophone playing, but to no avail. Just because he's a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to catch the attention of a married woman he fell in love with within five minutes of meeting her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Has this man ever been ashamed? If he had arranged and stopped doing stupid things and said stupid things, he would have been more attractive as a character, but unfortunately his character was tasteless and boring. <br /> <br /> Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British. She could have been as easily out of town in her normal voice as a British accent that sometimes disappeared during the film. <br /> <br /> The only two characters I cared about. were the fish and the frog. Now those two had chemistry! Academy Appointments for Both? STAT! Make holes, lack of character development, horrible acting, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a mess of a movie.
