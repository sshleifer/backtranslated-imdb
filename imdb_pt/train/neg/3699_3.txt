<br /> <br /> You would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role to be a funny movie. This is not the case here. I laughed out loud once during the whole movie, and it was not even during the final comedy scene (which I would also expect was the funniest one). This is one that you can watch when it comes to TV, do not spend any other money renting it.
