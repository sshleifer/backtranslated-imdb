I really enjoyed this movie until the end. Of course, it was tacky and very unlikely, but I still kept my eye on a rainy afternoon. By the end, this is it. For her final performance in the prestigious classical conservatory, where she has struggled to reach out to other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow them with the squeeze and execution of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and massacres the great and sensual Habanera of Carmen and turns her into an utterly forgettable pop song by Brittany Spears-wannabe. My ears bleed! And in the supreme moment of horror, his teachers gave him a standing ovation! Any teacher who was not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have failed her in the act. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
