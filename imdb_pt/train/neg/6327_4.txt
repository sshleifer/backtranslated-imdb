I thought this movie would be much better than it was. It sounded like a parody of the general spy, and the beginning reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this movie was short. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have set up a spy school to teach their spies to act like Americans, but the city they set up for training is a bit dated so they get two US plucked out to spice things up. above. I do not know, but it just seems to be out there. It is very strange when nobody near this Russian city speaks with a Russian accent. Someone missed the casting job. <br /> <br /> In addition, for a comedy this is painfully dry. There are one, two funny tops, and they are nothing to sing and dance to. The movie at the end will probably put you to sleep. <br /> <br /> And like a twisted punch in the face, this movie is so pro-American that it makes me sick. The movie keeps saying it over and over, the US is God and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of defamation campaign that was made against the Japanese in World War II. It's movies like these that make everyone think the US is full of themselves. <br /> <br /> That earns 4 out of 10, and I'm being kind. I really should have one, but the dance scene was funny, but again, it crawled a lot to be really funny.
