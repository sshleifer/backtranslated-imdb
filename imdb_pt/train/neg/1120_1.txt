I saw this movie in my international film class and was collected from picking it up. This movie is no more than a scene of brazen shock value after next. <br /> <br /> The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve, who has visions of his imminent danger. He meets a woman named Christine when giving a talk at a local book club, and only decides to stay with her when she finds out how her boyfriend is attractive. To be clearer, Reve likes Dutch sausage. So Reve invents a plan to seduce Christine's boyfriend so he can have sex with him. But later discovered that Christine had 3 previous husbands, which she all murdered. Now, Reve and Christine's boyfriend could be "THE 4TH MAN". The plot makes sense without plot holes. The editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine. The film is disgusting and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Reve coming out of bed in a T-shirt. So in the beginning, you can see Reve's beautiful cock moving while he walks around the tight apartment in a hangover state. He later has a dream where his dick is cut by scissors, and they show this along with the blood supply that follows. Reve caresses a statue of Jesus and does homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Besides, there's a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined. <br /> <br /> Not that I have anything against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is so cheeky when it comes to crashing. The whole movie revolves around the value of shock. <br /> <br /> So if any of these things are your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay well away from that. My mind still has scars.
