Be warned! <br /> <br /> This is the crap that other crap does not deign to be in company because it's below them! Ok, get it out of the way, let me say something more substantive. <br /> <br /> I've seen Ashes of Time for a long time thinking it was a new vision of material that is based on a highly revered Wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of director Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite all this, WKW failed to adapt the novel onscreen according to many wuxia fans; most of the time they are just drops of dripping water, drops of sweat, legs of running horses, etc. I could not sit for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later, when I wanted to give Mr. Wong's movies are another shot after listening to many compliments, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to get w / Chungking Express because it is his most affordable movies. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I was led to waste my time and money on this piece of nothing pretentious. Some professional critics have mentioned this as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a great modern city, blah, blah, blah. It's okay if the director has a point of view with something to say about why these things happen and tell. But no, it simply shows what it is. Faye Wong's performance is very typical of Hong Kong style: truncated enunciation, deer in the expression of big eyes on the horizon, tries to be a handsome and youthful type of performance; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired. <br /> <br /> I think the word, Auteur, is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different, which should be applauded, but not the one who has not yet mastered the art of cinematic storytelling, which is what Mr. Wong is, in the last 17 years!
