I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what he was thinking when he made this film. Normally, if he made a bad movie, I could blame the screenwriter or director, but in that case it's all his. The suckiness of this movie is all his fault. This proves that not even Heston can make an interesting Shakespeare story. I wasted two and a half hours of my life at this snooze festival and will never come back from that time. This is by far the worst Heston movie I have ever seen. If you are a fan of Shakespeare, you may find this movie fun, but if it is not, do not waste your time, you will regret it in the long run.
