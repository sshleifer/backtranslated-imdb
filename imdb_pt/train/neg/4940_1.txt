This show proved to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious space on the DVR's hard drive. I did not expect much and received less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled in the second episode, I can not believe Geico will try to use the EVER cave men's ad campaign again. I'd rather spend a night checking my daughter's hair because of the lice than seeing this piece of crap. I wonder what ABC went on to make this show fit the 2007 fall schedule, maybe a hospital / crime / mocumentary reality show with the AFLAC duck? In case I have not expressed my opinion about this show, let me be clear and say it's not too good.
