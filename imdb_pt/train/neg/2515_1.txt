This movie is an abomination, and its creation should have been considered a capital crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great mysteries of cinema is why no one has ever made a faithful film adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It's a really exciting tale of a mystery, nice old-fashioned romance and dry English humor. Why did the makers have to switch Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard cop to an amateur detective, present the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant, change part of the main story about the murder charge and the circumstances of Gordon's fight to save the accused? , etc etc? These producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the book should write the original script and not rape someone else's product.
