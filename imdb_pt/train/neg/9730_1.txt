Now, I hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He is an excellent actor, BRILLIANT at everything ... except this movie. And I think it was just because he realized how stupid this movie was, and did not bother with a good performance. This movie is an unintentional comedy. Some of the lines just make me laugh. And there are some lines that do not make sense, and it seems that Tobe Hooper just throws lines without thinking of the plot. Oh! BTW the plot is bad! But it's one of those movies that's TAHT BAD that's really painful to watch. I recommend this just for BIG fans Brad Dourif, or fans of any of the other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
