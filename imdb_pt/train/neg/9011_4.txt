Very normal B movie stuff. Seriously, anyone watching "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a lot of people making their first movie should know better than to wait for a real quality or even a moderate intelligence. B movies exist to re-work formulas that are popular. If you give them a symbolic analysis, it will ruin the movie (and perhaps write a slanderous review of IMDb). <br /> <br /> I liked the female lead, Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I thought she was remarkably attractive. It was a memorable appearance at the B movies. Unfortunately, I do not see where she's made any movies since. I'll take care of her again.
