I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on redoing bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can just wait. Although this remake was not a total waste, I still would like to have the six dollars back to go towards a DVD of the original. Lots of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. Just reiterate why Hollywood should leave good things alone.
