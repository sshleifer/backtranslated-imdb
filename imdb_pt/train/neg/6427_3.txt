So I found this documentary strange and meaningless. I know there are awards and things, but I personally did not like it very much. there was no humor or drama to keep him interested, just a lot of wierdos and their jobs. some of the people are quite different, which is not a bad thing, just did not leave a good impression on me. I was completely bored with this movie, no offense to my creative writing teacher. the circus theme throughout the movie was kind of cool, but I did not get it, and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing. the green stuff was cool, I really enjoyed the garden full of colorful flowers, but how did these four jobs get connected? it just did not make much sense to me because someone would make a movie about it. But if you like things like that, you might like it. Who am I to stand in your way? I'm just warning you about possible suffering.
