For the life of me I can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this movie totally unbelievable ...... and I think I have the qualifications to say it .... I am a former Special Operations soldier, with 14 years in the "lifestyle" ... This film was totally totally unreal and obviously written by someone who did very little research on life in the Army, in combat or on a team or platoon level. <br /> <br /> Three guys from EOD trotting in Bagdad on their own ????? Get Real ... No chain of command ????? Get Real ... EOD cleaning buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Qualified Sniper buck sergeant ???? Get Real .... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy and then let two guys take me without firing another shot or being hurt at all ???? Be real ... I will send an Iraqi civilian while I am armed with only 9,000, invade another civilian house, be punished by his wife and then return to the camp by walking in the middle of Baghdad at night without as much as a scratch or confrontation ???? Be Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no adherence to the military protocol and no resemblance whatsoever to any Army unit I have encountered. Totally unbelievable and disrespectful to the men and women of DOE who, unlike this poor movie, are not crazy about adrenaline in search of yahoos, but from extremely skilled professionals who do an incredibly difficult job.
