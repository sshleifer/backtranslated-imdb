As an impressionable 10-year-old, I enjoyed the "love conquers all" philosophy of the 70's comedy "Bridget Loves Bernie." I understood the controversy, which was about the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and the two parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have problems with the interreligious marriage of the young couple. Looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences, I'm amazed that the show has been successful despite a highly rated season. Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who a few years after the program's cancellation would write the hit play "Same Time, Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light and superficial comedy that collapsed under its own weight. There was no denying the real-life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But in recent years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his short role in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here they were trying to breathe life into a show that needed a very grumpy comic edge, which could have given the deepest complications to a very controversial subject. <br /> <br /> The show aired Saturday night between two CBS powers. : "All in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both shows were clever, funny and had a sufficient advantage (more in the first than the last) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and only had a few occasional laughs. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered.
