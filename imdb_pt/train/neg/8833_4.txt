No flaws for the actors (they all did great performances), the overall story was not very well executed. The movie opens with a great caretaker: a crazy old man forces the car of an aboriginal young woman off the road. But then we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new set of characters ... and we do not know why until the 40 minutes are over. It turns out they are the ones who find out the girl's body ... and the story moves on from there. <br /> <br /> As the story shows up at this point, it really does not get you anywhere. After two hours, I wondered: was there any point in this, or was it just to watch the characters fight with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they dealt with the discovery? The story turned out to be unsatisfactory and seemed unfinished. Although well represented, there is not a strong enough backbone in the film to justify its recommendation.
