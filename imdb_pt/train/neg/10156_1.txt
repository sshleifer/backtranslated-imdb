Its spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character winked at her breasts. That was pretty tight. Before and after that, the film practically blows. The acting is like E-list and is shown well in the movie. Not to mention that the budget is so low that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The entire movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder instead of a half decent movie. The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Also, if you see this movie on Blockbuster, do everyone a favor and hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be evaluated mentally.
