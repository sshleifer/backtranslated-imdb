"I went to the cinema, to see 'Beat Street' / it was not bad, it was kind of 'cool', 'Krush Groove' was a movie, I did not care / but when it comes to 'Rappin', I drew the line ". Word to your mother. <br /> <br /> Do you want me to stop? <br /> <br /> This is just a small sampling of the rhymin stima-fly style on display in this film waste and location permissions. This movie is seriously crazy (that's talking about the 80s for just f * cking horrible). As emcee, Mario Van Peebles is a great actor. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a great bodybuilder. <br /> <br /> Any movie called "Rappin '" is best that reaches the highest standard of the time. So why did the six-year-olds get into the aisles, even on the day the standards were so high? - Webster? Because this rap is weak. So weak that even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will play it with a 10-foot gold chain. <br /> <br /> Blondie's "Rapture" is poetry def alongside this piece of Dr. Suess on the hood. So do not be a boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
