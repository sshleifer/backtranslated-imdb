STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Missing the Mark *** That Little Among ** Delayed from behind * The Wells <br /> <br /> In this debut effort for Nick's beloved man Park and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon when good old Wallace runs out of cheese. <br /> <br /> In addition to being the smallest feature in just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is also the oldest and it kind of shows. The plasticine animation is a bit funny and funny here, sort of reminiscent of Mork's animation about the little man in the box. <br /> <br /> Brave that the craft behind it is, I've never been to Wallace & Gromit immensely (maybe a little clean and traditional for someone of my generation). The only thing I really liked was The Wrong Trousers (and that was more of when I was younger and less conscious of, say, the sordid pleasures of life.) I was led to actively seek this initial effort because of the resurgence of popularity as the result of the highly successful film adaptation. <br /> <br /> As impressive as the first two (all things considered!) this does not have the emotional angle that its successors would have. Having said that, it's quite fun as a first try and it certainly set the standard for the bigger things to come. Two stars, but good two stars. **
