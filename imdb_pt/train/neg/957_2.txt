So I got this as a designation for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the film department at the University of Washington. I think this is the only real way to get someone to see his movie ... <br /> <br /> The documentary section at first crawled. Yes, the kid is crazy nowhere, but that's not good enough to keep him interesting. Seeing Sean Penn dressed as an ONJ is the only highlight ... and after about thirty seconds he loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover confronts Larry, the story was better, but I could not take it anymore ...
