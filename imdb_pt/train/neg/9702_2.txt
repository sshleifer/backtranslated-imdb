I do not think this movie was rated correctly. I took my copy and erased the PG rating and noted R. I would not recommend this to anyone under 17 or 18, whatever the R limit. <br /> <br /> Why? It contains a jungle scene with several topless Indian women. I do not know about you, but this is not something for little kids to be watching. True, it may be the traditional African-style "clothing style", but ... I think partial nudity should give the film an R rating. I have not seen the movie recently, but I think otherwise, okay.
