You need to watch this program once to see them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something his way, he means well, but he disturbs his wife, in the end she finds out that what he did was really for her, she caresses his cheek and smirks as he looks shyly. In fact, the story lines are so stupid and stereotypical that I'm going to stab one now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jims wife realizes that every Jims weekly payout has disappeared, he then explains to her that he has lost at the casino. She screams and leaves the house regretting how horrible he is. Then, on Valentine's Day, he shows up in a limo with tickets for a ball (hence explaining the missing wages). She notices the error "her" and the usual "Oh Jim, you are so adorable". The other very obvious item is the fact that Jims' character is based on Homer Simpson, who as a cartoon character can get away from being belligerent and ignorant when that is tempted with humans, he does not work and Jim has just come as an arrogant and selfish idiot. <br /> <br /> IMO, the only reason this is successful is simply because we are many now in terms of humans with TVs, nowadays you could do a show about a man who isolates walls and you get an audience. <br /> <br /> "Two and a Half Men," on the other hand, is fantastic and hilarious.
