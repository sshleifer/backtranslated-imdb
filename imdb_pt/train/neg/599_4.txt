Okay, I must say before the revelation of the 'monster'. saying that he really did not fit into that category, just some weird thing that had an annoying scream! And personally, I think a grandmother could have run away from this, but anyway. Actually, I was getting into that movie, although having a drunken character and a heroin addict was not an appeal. But scenes like when she runs away from the train, and you can see that the figure at the door was kind of scary, also where the guard had just been killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the disaster was stuck by the time the monster was revealed, and eventually became its medium horror, with limited emotions or scares. Slowly I became more bored and wanted to shut up. I like that most people said they were rooting for the homeless to do this, especially the guy, he gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie could have really been something special, instead it has become what all the other horrors these days are! Just boring and well, not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a nonsensical party (which is limited, hardly any in fact) by all means give it a go but for all of you, serious horror watchers, look elsewhere, much better movies out there.
