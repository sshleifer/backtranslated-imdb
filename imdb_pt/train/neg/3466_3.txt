A slasher movie, made in the early 1980s, has a curse on it, which has someone trying to end death. Years later, a group of film students tried to complete the film - also resurrecting the deadly curse movies. Great idea for a movie, but unfortunately 'Cut' is just another wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia does not have the best history in the world when it comes to terror. 'Razorback' (1984) was a failure as "Holwing III" (1987), which was half American film anyway. As for our foray into the comedy horror, "Body Melt" (1993) is best left to forget. The problem with 'Cut' is that the creators try to create a satire of intelligent horror to the 'Scream' (1996), but they have no discernment about the genre or what makes it work. And although it sounds strange to say this about a horror movie, but what 'Cut' really is missing is any 'heart'. Of course it follows the basic "rules" set by "Scream", but does not want to play with the formula, instead, it goes to a cardboard copy of the previous one. <br /> <br /> The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most annoying and uncharacteristic villains in the history of horror films. His endless barrage awkwardly, lame headlines made the dialogue of a porn look like Shakespeare. The cast never seems to be fully involved and it looks like they're just waiting for a shoot to end so they can get their paychecks. And the feel of the movie is as if it is deliberately trying not to be scary; looking like another episode of 'Neighbours' or 'Heartbreak High'. By the way, these attempts in the style of MTV, hyper-cinema during the "search" sequence only look lame, dated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If Australia already has the chance to make horror again (which I hope we still do) perhaps we should get a sheet from the book "Mad Max" (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US, we must try our own interpretation of the genre.
