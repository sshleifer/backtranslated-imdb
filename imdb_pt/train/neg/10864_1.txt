The reason I intended to give this film a chance to take 2 hours out of my life (in fact, it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and, hopefully, enjoy Indian cinema. All I've seen are some of the older films of S. Ray. <br /> <br /> Browsing the IMDb I came across this one and after seeing the rating of 8.7 concludes that this should be the one that will open the doors of the unknown. and bring artistic pleasure. Oh my how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that the majority of the 970 people who voted are Indian and their only venture outside of Bolliwood's production were the Adam Sandler films. <br /> <br /> With this classification, this movie would be in 9th place. in the IMDb list of 250 best films above Citizen's Cane, Psycho's Goodfellas! I really do not feel like reviewing and criticizing because there is simply nothing that I think is worth remembering from this painful experience. My only hope is that there are many Hindus who, like me, find this movie the way it is - just stupid, with plenty of tacky and tacky music.
