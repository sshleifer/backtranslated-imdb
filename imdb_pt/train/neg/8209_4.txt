The performance, despite other criticisms, was remarkably well done. Brad Pitt deals very well with the role of an irritating and obnoxious Austrian mountaineer. Another performance is fine. The story could have been fascinating, but somehow missing - you never understand or care about the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to appeal to this audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful landscapes and cinematography, a veridical and extraordinarily dramatic story, important events that shaped the world we live in - but I could not, however hard I get involved in this story. As a cheeky Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to * love * this movie - and yet it left me cold. <br /> <br /> It could be a failure within me, but I tend to point to the creative end of this film - direction, script, production, editing - somehow, they missed me. Too bad, because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully filmed - should have been magnificent. It was not. Probably worth watching, just to think about it - but do not expect too much, and maybe you will not be as disappointed as I am. Mostly, it bore me.
