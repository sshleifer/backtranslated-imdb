It is true that I think Al Pacino is a guilty pleasure. He was a great actor to Scent of a Woman, where he apparently kills himself too much. I had hoped that this film, of which I had heard almost nothing, would be a little gem. An intelligent and engaging, neglected city-politics thriller ahead of its time. It is not. The City Hall is a film that obscures its plot with so many characters, names and "realist" issues throughout the city, which for a time you think is such a large and complex plot that one Once you discover the truth, it will blow your mind. In fact, however, these subplots and digressions ultimately result in trademarks of reasonably familiar and familiar urban histories such as Power Corruption, Two-Face Politicians, Mafia with Police Ties, and so on. And, theoretically, this setting allows some exciting tension, fears that neither character is safe, and anything can happen! But again, this does not really happen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things that happen are quite predictable, and we get a lot of "confession" monologues, which mean as a whole a kind of fable, a lesson about the moral ambiguity of the "world real "politics and society. But after 110 minutes of missing names and reports and a web of lies and cover-ups, the public is usually treated with a rather satisfying revelation. I do not think we got this in the city hall, and despite being a very complete movie, I do not think it's completely rich.
