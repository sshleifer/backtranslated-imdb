They have changed the title of this atrocity to Unexpected Love. The only thing worse is the movie itself. The script contains dialogues that would be ridiculed in a third-grade recital. At one point, when the wife leaves her husband, a bad cover of All by Myself plays on the soundtrack! No joking. The actors try, but are defeated by the inept script, incredibly terrible. Direction is incredibly bad. No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How are things done like this? I'm turning off the television before it's over!
