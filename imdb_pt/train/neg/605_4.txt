I'll keep this short as a movie as this does not deserve a thorough review. <br /> <br /> Given the setup, this movie could have been something really special. It could have been another "28 days later" or even a "Blair Witch Project" <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the movie I was really excited, the director did a decent job with cinematography and suspense, although I do not think he has managed to capture the true eeriness of an empty London underground. <br /> <br /> The characters were a big disappointment. Our "heroine" in this movie sucks useless, and you really do not care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I was rooting for the homeless and the nigga, who managed to give me a laugh or two (whether intentional to the writers or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when it is revealed I was very disappointed. I will not ruin it, but let's just say that my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a free fight. <br /> <br /> In short, this is just another mediocre horror movie that falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula. This movie had great potential, but it actually failed to hit the target. <br /> <br /> Just to highlight how bad this movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain. . Instead, they run away.
