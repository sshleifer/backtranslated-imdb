Nothing could have saved this movie, not even Superman. <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, the special effects would have been surprising. Better direction could have awakened more of the actors' feelings and performances. But nothing more than feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it. Make holes, bad lines, terrible rhythm, endless repetition of the same images of a CGI dragon stepping through the corridors ... ugh. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
