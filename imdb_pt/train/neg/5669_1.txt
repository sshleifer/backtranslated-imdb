The director, dressed in chains and leather, warned the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival late Friday that we were about to see an "experimental" film. Experimental? Leave the camcorder in the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and edit in all the useless mess inside the view. A sinuous pastiche street parade that starts nowhere and does not take the public to anywhere. The gratuitous violence that opens the film took more of a patrono of the theater of Castro. I would have gone too, but my movie buddy needed a ride home and I had this thing of seeing the worst until the end. When the lights went on, the audience declined considerably. Warm applause. Formal questions from the director who seemed satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
