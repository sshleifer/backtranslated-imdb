This movie is little more than fetish porn badly made, and that's saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made back then. This was recommended to me by a friend as a "unique cinematic experience". Was he right. I suppose he meant it as a joke. Not disgusting, not even so shocking. Just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art. A little bit of camp value, though I do not believe the makers of this movie intended it. And yes, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear suit. Do not spend too much money on it. Try to borrow if you need to see it. Or contact me, I would be happy to sell my copy for half the price. <br /> <br /> I may have to see another film from the director in particular, since he seems to have some followers. But if it's something like that, I'll regret another two hours of my life forever.
