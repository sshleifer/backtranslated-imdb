Very possible. As Francis Veber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least by sticking to his native France), has managed to transform into a film so completely unattainable that it is beyond the mere mortal man's reason to discern. It is not only that the characters are so unpleasant or that the film is totally devoid of the lowest wit: it is genuinely physically painful to watch, an endless parade of writing, acting and unsuitable movie production that you can not believe is the job of experienced filmmakers - and talented. For the first time, the almost eternity passed in the courtroom and on the bookshelf before his theatrical release of "blink and lose" tells the whole story. What were they thinking?
