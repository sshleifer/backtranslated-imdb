Dr. Mordrid is terrifying. I would not recommend to any adult or child to see this, unless they are attacking killers already. There is so much filth in this movie that it hurts my yes. Speaking of eyes, there are eyes in the sky, against a background of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such a perverse thing. I rented all copies of the local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix. This movie must remain locked in a basement behind the 4th dimension with all the other nasty beasts of hell. That's where this movie belongs. I suggest that if you want some outrageous entertainment, go and rent All Dogs Go To Heaven, or Angels In The Outfield. These movies are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies, you need to see Dr. Mordrid.
