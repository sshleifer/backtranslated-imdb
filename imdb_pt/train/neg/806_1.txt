Simply torture. <br /> <br /> I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this terrible conversation again - ever. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. You know, the good thing about Swiss cheese is that, along with the holes, you get some cheese: here are just holes - and the excitement factor? Well, it turns out watching the paint dry in an adrenaline rush and an Olympic speed sport. <br /> <br /> My brain hurts trying to figure out who this idiot was, did they think about the premise? (I sincerely hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) the only consolation is that they have had the pleasure of sitting through the reeds. Made for TV should not be synonymous with: "Of course, let the horses run through the living rooms! Our audience is an idiot!" <br /> <br /> I was hooked just to know how it could get worse. That's not a good sign, people. Hallmark should be ashamed to release him. <br /> <br /> I should be ashamed to watch it. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed. I'm out for a long shower.
