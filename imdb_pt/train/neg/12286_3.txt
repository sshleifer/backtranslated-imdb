The summary provided by my cable guide made it seem a lot more interesting than it really is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen, a title previously held by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From his opening scene I could say that it will be very bad, but I was so bored that I could not care less. This movie contains laughable acts, especially by the guy who is tormented in his dreams, incredible as in unreliable twists, and some of the worst songs I've ever heard, and I'm living in a period when Britney Spears and O Nsync dominate the air waves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it's not funny. One would be such a monotonous and boring movie and not as scary as this one would try to spice things up a bit with some fun one-liners here and there, but no. We have the selfish friend of Tormented Guy trying to be funny, but instead we seem annoying. (spoiler) And please tell me, who in this crazy world is insane and self-loathing enough to visit a scary prison in the middle of the night? Nobody! If you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it believable. This is anything but.
