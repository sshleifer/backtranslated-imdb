Let me first state that I like watching "bad" movies. It's funny how some of these films leave a lasting impression on the truly superb. This movie is bad in a disturbingly malicious way. This vehicle for the delusional ego of Sam Mraovich not only limits the ineptitude without talent, redefined the very meaning of words. This should always be the barometer for bad movies. Type Mendoza line for film. Mraovich writes, directs and stars the blunt object Arthur Sailes battling despised wives and Christian evil forces while he and his partner Ben "dead before the eyes" Sheets fight for equality in marriage. As a libertarian, I believe that gays should have the right to marry. Ben and Arthur do more harm to this cause than an army of homophobes. The picture of all things Christian is so ugly and hammered, trademark Mraovich, is that you can not take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother, Victor, the bible that carries the madness of Jesus, is so horribly over-the-top of evil / effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast for this role. That's because Sam "multitask" Mraovich was also casting director. Worst of all is Sam Mraovich himself. When do you think the protagonist makes the words pasty, bald and plump come up? Sam also offers lines like domino pizza, cold and generally wrong. The final count: you are very bad at writing, directing, acting and releasing. This is the quadruple crown Ed Wood. Congratulations, you horrible little man.
