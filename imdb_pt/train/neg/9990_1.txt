Having watched this movie on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this movie was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences, or "delights," as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me. The plot is not worth commenting on, but basically a plane carrying football players falls into the territory of the Yeti. Before the movie is over, we are toasted by the deception of the yetis, still running in an effort to run before jumping 50 yards, but tearing a man's legs and slapping him with them, a woman killing a rabbit within 30 meters with a dart , a yeti that survived several bullets and was burned with no apparent damage, a yeti hung on a cliff holding a man's shoe, but then jumping, and a whole collection of additional and bizarre occurrences. Basically, if you're not staying on a Saturday for the express purpose of watching the worst of the original SciFi movies, avoid this movie like a plague. Or as my friend reading over my shoulder says, "It's the best movie I've ever seen." To which the friend to my right says: "Only the techno music of battle could have made it better."
