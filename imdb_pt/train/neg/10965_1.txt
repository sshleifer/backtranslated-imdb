Actually, I'm watching this movie as I write this. . . If the following comments "prove my lack of development as a true artistic director," that's fine. . But. . . I thought (I'm still thinking how I'm seeing now) that this movie. . . to say the least, is very, very overrated. Again, a lot. <br /> <br /> It seems like a really bad movie made by someone with extremely limited resources. . . and who did not pay much attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go on and talk about all the different ways that I think this movie is missing, but. . . good . . . I just do not understand (remember, I totally admit that maybe it's ME that's the idiot here - not the filmmaker - for not having that "piece of imaginative genius"). . . I rented this on a special treat because the reviews were very, very exceptional. . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
