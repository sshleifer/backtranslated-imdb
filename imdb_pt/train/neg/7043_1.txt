I was prepared to laugh throughout this movie as a Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was annoying. It seems the producers had a lot of biker-enthusiastic friends, and from there they decided to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It is often unacceptable. Many images of cyclists riding on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is just in the movie. Harmon would probably have cheered things up. She may have other commitments on the day she was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, motorcyclists terrorize a small town. Fights, murder, a coward cop, a silly mechanic, etc. One of the cyclists always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all other outlaws. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer. . One scene shows a motorcyclist assaulting a woman, shouting at the lady's face, "You're all the same! You're all the same!" We came back to the scene a minute later and he again declares "You're all the same!". Could not the writer think of anything more creative to say? <br /> <br /> In the end, the good guys killed the bad guys. We also learned that the marriage between middle-aged mechanic Joe and young Susie was canceled. Susie is going to college and all of a sudden we find out that Joe's wedding is still going on (but with a different bride). End.
