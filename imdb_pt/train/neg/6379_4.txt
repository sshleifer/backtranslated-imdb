With a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space", how could you go wrong? Just play some of the stereotypes of the characters, use the Village People as the leading providers of the soundtrack and launch thousands of gay jokes. The plot is not important. Too bad, this movie does not contain any of it and all the jokes lose the place. All the characters look like the German gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was prepared to laugh even more about the movie. My expectation was apparently high.
