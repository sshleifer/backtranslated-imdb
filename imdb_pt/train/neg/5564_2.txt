Probably the worst Dolph movie of all time. There is nothing you want or expect here. Do not waste your time. Dolph plays an unfortunate policeman with no interests in life. His brother is dead and Dolph tries to figure things out. The character is simply stupid and stumbles aimlessly. Meaningless.
