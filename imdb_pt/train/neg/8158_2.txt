What is the purpose of creating sequences that have absolutely no relevance to the original movie? No point That's why the sequels of Dance Night are so embarrassingly bad. The original film involved a group of children who hid a dark secret that would kill them but one in a brutal act of revenge. Can anyone explain to me what a prom queen about to raise from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then? Prom Night 2 has had continuous holes that have left the public constantly wondering how this happened and why should this happen? But in the end, I think you could call it one of those movies that is so bad that you end up laughing at yourself.
