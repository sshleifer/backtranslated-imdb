My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as a "recommended" selection if you liked "Office Space". <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Spirited, humorous and with characters that remind me of people I've worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to the "office space" in which both are movies. That's where the similarity ends. We probably sat in the first 50 minutes of HT, giving the benefit of the doubt, hoping, or rather, * praying * for it to improve. This did not happened. We can not take it anymore and we stop the tape. Thank goodness it was a free rental. I would have been p *** if we had actually paid for it. We must be reimbursed for having to go through this. Now, seeing that we have not seen the end, he may gather miraculously and redeem himself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The Haiku Tunnel is so bad that it's hard to believe it's ever been produced. The film is so bland that it's painful. Just send the damn lyrics already !!! The premise is asinine. The jokes are horrible. We got to where the "printer does not work" and had to stop. We can not take it anymore. This movie is an EMBARRASSMENT for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are an Office Space fan ...... do not waste your time on this crap. 0/10
