At Steve Irwin's show, he's hillarious. He does not even try to be funny and he just is, but his movie was not even what I would call a movie - I mean, when that guy in his car is trying to kill him, he's just saying 'Oh, this is a nasty face! and looking directly at the camera. He put his face in the camera too! And then, when the guy falls out of the car, would not you expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst performance I've ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve, it just says "Steve." She did not look scared or anything, it was just 'Steve'. I mean, I hate to sound mean, but that was not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin, but his movie was very stupid.
