Do not waste your time watching this! Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things, you should not make a good movie. I do not usually review a movie, but this is personal. I wasted precious time that they can not return. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste time watching this crap. If this was a student project, I would have to say it's not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after that it gets annoying. the screams, the bad audio, the bad video (a good cameraman could have done a lot better). and yes, what about the Blair-Witch effect? no budget I was hoping it would improve, but that does not happen. Now how the hell did that deserve a 4? 2 is fairer but 1 for wasting my time! I said my peace.
