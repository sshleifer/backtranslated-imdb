This installment of Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about rhythm and a decent and plausible dialogue. There were times when I literally screamed on TV for something to happen. Maybe he thinks he's building suspense, but Carpenter needs to reduce his overshoot, his (or his son's) simplified musical score, and advance the action a bit. How many times did the girl say, "Oh, no, I can not have this baby!" and "Oh, not here?" Carpenter takes elements of much better movies (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and plays them here as if we should recognize and appreciate his trademark style. What's missing here is genuine suspense and energy. It's as if he's been slumbering in the process of making movies. <br /> <br /> For best carpenter movies, stay with the classics tested and proven - The Thing, Halloween and They Live. For top masters of horror episodes, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer and Dreams in the Witch House.
