I know you've read this before in countless other movies, no doubt, if you're reading the reviews here, but the voodoo academy remains the absolute worst movie I've been able to track. no doubt the really bad ones are not even available to buy or watch on tv, but even so I feel it's fair to qualify that I'm not just an idiot renter who chose it badly. <br /> <br /> We've seen two-thirds of the 100 best rated movies here on imdb, and I'm passing the rest with every shot. most of them stay head and shoulders above it ... excersize in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to rate really bad movies (like in people with no humor, even how bad they are) by how many people you need to watch it to do all the way. if you can watch by yourself, it's not that bad. if you can watch with a single friend ... it's bad, but it can be much worse. <br /> <br /> We took 5 of us to go all the way through the voodoo academy. and even the generally fun times of watching bad movies (for example, locating the boom microphone, 3 times in a case I'm not mistaken) can take the dry taste out of my mouth. yes, I watched, but I also forced 4 of my friends to watch with me to achieve that end. <br /> <br /> I wait and pray to see the directors cut off ... to think that there could be a 20-minute version of big eyebrows with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos, just scaring me. much of the film revolves around it. <br /> <br /> I applaud David Decoteau for having managed to photograph this movie in two days on a very short budget, just as I applaud him for persuading people to pay him to do what is undoubtedly a celluloid version of some of their fetishes. but it's not a good movie. the original store of horrors was filmed in the same time period for a comparative amount of money (considering inflation) and was an absolute gem. is not an excuse for how bad this baby is. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ahead ... <br /> <br /> It's not even worth separating the holes in the plot or the cliches we know from all the hero characters. The rhythm of the movie ... is insane ... nothing ... is interesting by the time that Cleave devotes to the self pectoral massage. no matter what your alignment or gender ... rubbing simply can not sustain this kind of screen time. <br /> <br /> The acting is cheesy ... but not overly amateurish ... I've seen much worse in better movies ... but somehow it's the semi-competent delivery of some of the worst lines that you've heard in a movie, that really surrenders. <br /> <br /> Rent it if, like me, you have a fascination with the worst of the worst, and only if you go to watch with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it. this is not ha ha ha the whole wobbled affair. It's a stamina test that you'll probably want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure there are worse things ... but I would not be surprised if he had the name of decoteau.
