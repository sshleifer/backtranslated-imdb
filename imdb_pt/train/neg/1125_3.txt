I went to school with Jeremy Earl, that's how I heard about this movie, I really do not know if it was in the movies. I do not remember the name. I saw it, it's like one of those specials after school. The performance is good, not great. The plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty cheesy. So the only comment I can give to this movie is "Eh" I borrowed Jeremy's movie, if I was at a movie rental location, this is one I would pass on and after watching it I would not recommend it no one high school age. I also noticed that many times when urban children are portrayed, slang is overused or just outdated. I often think that's what makes your characters unbelievable.
