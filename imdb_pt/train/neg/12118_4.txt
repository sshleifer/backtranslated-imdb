In 1972, after his wife left to go his own way, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a good-natured, long-haired, lovely, sculptural beauty queen, is set to fill a void in Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce became definitive, Linda was already in place as the girlfriend and traveling companion of the legendary actor until 1976. This is a gaudy look at his case of love and companionship. Linda, with all her heart, taking care of the needs and desires of her lover. And even bearing the medicines he swallowed by the hand full and presenting it to his own love affair with valium. Sometimes this movie is hard and dark at heart; a very uninteresting look at the 'King' and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely horrible like Elvis. More than acting to the fullest is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist does not have Linda's class, but does the job very well. The supporting cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching this twice is more than enough for me, but do not let this comment stop you from checking it out. For most Elvis fans I talked to, this is not a favorite performance.
