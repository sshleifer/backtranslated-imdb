I went to watch this movie expecting an action movie 'nothing much', I was still very disappointed. The opening scene promised a bit of action with a touch of comedy. It keeps you hooked for the first half, until you're hoping it's time for action now. Well, none of this happens. The film crawls and the end just knocks you to the point where you get irritated. No matter what the director was thinking. It did not make any sense. The film was lacking in all aspects, it did not have a real plot and it seemed very empty, even if "Rambo" was in it, I do not think it could have helped in the classification. There is simply no logic to the film. A perfect way to waste your time and money. By far the most annoying movie I have ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same viewpoint after enduring it. Definitely not for people who have a bit of film sense left in them.
