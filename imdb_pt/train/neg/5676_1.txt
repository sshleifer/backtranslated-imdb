This film shows a clip of mutilation of live animals from an animal being hacked by a machete and tearing off its skin. I know these horrible things happen in the world, but I'm watching movies based on the fact that what I'm watching is not really happening on the screen. These clips of live animals are not meant to be movies, they are meant to show people who belong to certain organizations the horrible things humans do to other species. <br /> <br /> This should be banished and destroyed. I also got in touch with Netflix and other resources to help get this movie out of the market. <br /> <br /> This movie should be removed from the public. The person who made this movie needs psychological help.
