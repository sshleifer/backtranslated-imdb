If you have read the book - do not leave your hopes high, if you have not read it - read it and never watch the movie. It's strange to know that Toby Young was really involved in writing the script (as he states in the book's post script). Because the film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the film seems to be looking at - making a thought-provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with simple funny sarcasm and simplifying it for all to understand - achieves perfection. The film is full of cheap and bad jokes, suitable for serials, and lost any meaningful message it could have had. <br /> <br /> You better not see him.
