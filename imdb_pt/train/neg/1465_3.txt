Well, first I would like to add that I myself am a historian, so what I look for in a film based on historical events is that it is based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Of course the movie is fun and all, but the fact that it is not entirely based on true facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for the Jews before the First World War. It was however during the First World War and thereafter he formed his views on the Jews. His creation in this film is also imprecise, Hitler as a child was not a disturbed brat. He had a more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that contribute to the enigma that is Hitler. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he does not really fit into the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he is portrayed here. In his younger years, he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" people through his charms. His unstable behavior and angry outbursts began at the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about Hitler's life based on real historical facts and not on accusations. I really hate it when people point out a guilty finger, for example, Hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint an image of them as pure evil. It is much better to tell the story EXACTLY how it was for all to learn as it was! Those who were behind this movie should have done some research before doing this. Because it seems they did not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary march at Munch, his shoulder was torn from his cavity. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a good documentary than to see this.
