I have to say that I was really looking forward to watching this movie and finding a new life in it that would separate it from most Mexican movies. I have no idea why, but I relied on Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence into our nonexistent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack (which I listened to before watching the movie) sounded different from the others, perhaps because I dared to include younger faces (besides Demian Bichir, who is always a favorite of Mexican filmmakers) and supposedly inside his script with modern social behavior, perhaps because the photograph I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic rather than theatrical. The film turned out to be a great pleasure for all and one big disappointment. What Serrano really deals with here is the very old "battle of the sexes" as in "all men are equal" and "why all women ..."; blah blah blah. Nothing new in that, not even that, he uses so much common ground and cliché that he eventually mocks himself without leaving any valuable reflection on the female / male condition. Filled with the usual vagabonds in the audience as sure jokes about the clichés I've talked about before (those always work, always) and screaming performances (it's a well-represented movie in its context) ... and shouting literally means. The most attractive characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir were, according to Serrano, the most pathetic. I completely disagree with Serrano, they should not have been treated that way just to serve as puppets for his lesson to pass ... he made a point of having his message and completely destroyed their roles which were the only solid ground on which this story could have cated. Anyway, it is after all a very fun movie sometimes and you will probably have a good time watching it (if you agree to be manipulated by it).
