I know nobody cares, but I know. This movie is historical for a reason. It is the union of two heroes from two major science fiction films of the seventies. Well, one is great and one is really bad. The big one is really great, in fact, it's the best. The bad is really bad, it's actually the worst. Of course the great I refer to "Star Wars" and is star Mark Hamill, also known as "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this movie about a boy who gets his swiped Vette and then goes to Vegas (in a lead) and after many adventures, ends up recovering it. (Since he's fixing cars, I think you might call him "Luck Skywalker"). Along the way he meets a prostitute with a heart of gold, and ends up facing a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the 1970s sci-fi cult film "Laserblast," which is, as I suggested earlier, the worst sci-fi movie ever made. Milford plays the lead role of whom Hamill must steal his car back. I realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great science fiction heroes, but I know. And I should also say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. Mark Hamill's performance needs strength, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the prostitute character played by Annie Potts may be the most annoying character of all time in any movie I've ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day, or a night from Monday to Friday, late at night, very late. It's one of those movies that snakes, looking for something, but without finding it, and at the same time, the whole purpose is, like free-form jazz, simply to exist as it is. And that happens. And what it is, it's not great, but you can not say it's not fun, because for an hour and a half you may feel cheated, but you will not feel cheated. Therefore, turn off your mind, relax and enjoy this confused gem without any expectation, and may the force be always with you.
