Call, erase. This seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature that can pick it up and distribute it with equal abandon. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but I ended up committed to seeing all the movies in the fifty-fifty science fiction collection released by Mill Creek / Treeline Films. It's a great value at about twenty-five dollars, so at fifty cents a movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the silly offers. Gammera is irritated from a long time of sleep by a nuclear explosion, and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes to Tokyo, putting the United Nations in motion to try to work out a plan to save the planet. They arrive at 'Plan Z', the hope of the world, and you do not know it, there is a scene in which a huge hut is shown and is called the 'Z Plan' building; this was a beautiful touch. <br /> <br /> By the mid-1960s, this country was still not politically correct. One of the American military scenes in the Alaska Air Defense Sector had General Arnold ask a sergeant to make coffee. I do not think there were any soldiers around. <br /> <br /> Good old Gammera was quite different, walking around with two legs and going into the flaming routine when challenged. That's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture a turtle-man in the nose of a hidden spaceship, taking him to Mars to save the world. With five tickets for the entire American and Russian team that made the rescue, now let's get back to the Cold War. Like Godzilla, Gammera has generated at least a good dozen movies, but having seen this pretty much satisfies my interest in flying, flaming tortoises. Especially since the DVD package I mentioned earlier has "Monster Attack" with a special Big G appearance. I took everything I had to do by the end of both films; it was a great relief to get to the last frame in this one that said 'Gammera, Sayonara!'
