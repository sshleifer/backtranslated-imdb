This is one of the most talked about movies I've ever had to go through. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon, so who cares, as long as it's cute and fun? <br /> <br /> I do not go as deep as the characterizations, or I'll be here all day (except to say that they do not exist, the characters change personality whenever convenient for the plot), but whoever has written the script and the visual direction must have prohibited access to pencil and paper. Thumbs down? I would vote to cut your thumbs off. <br /> <br /> "Enter an object / prop Cut to character close-up." Character gives a look of knowledge, which the public will not even remotely understand. "Make the characters pay no attention to all the huge pieces of rock that are floating, colliding with each other, usually raining destruction everywhere, and that could kill them at any time - but to make them stop and sigh with fear when they see a seemingly pastoral and harmless green rock in the distance. "<br /> <br /> The whole thing is a long succession of events, actions, and behaviors that are there just for convenience to prevent him from having to think or make any effort to write the story properly. <br /> <br /> This is Plan 9 of CG cartoons, except for the fact that it lacks Ed Wood's moaning factor to make it fun to watch. Do yourself a favor: Spend your cartoon budget on Pixar movies.
