Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku on the very good Wrong Turn, I decided to choose this instead of Return of the Living Dead from all the movies. I have not seen that yet, but considering it's one of the most acclaimed horror films of all time, it's safe to say that I made the wrong choice. There's simply nothing to recommend this movie, and I'm talking about the supposedly superior cut of the killer. I did not even have the juvenile sexual appeal of mediocre movies for the poor as I know what you did last summer or Valentine or urban legend. It simply made no sense, contained no excitement, had very little interesting acting or convincing writing. The release date has apparently been postponed numerous times for about a year in a row, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie comes out as a bunch of senseless scenes played at random, to a nonsensical effect. Get Wrong Turn instead, if you want to see Dushku. I'd like to see a movie with her and the super-sexy Elisabeth Harnois - but I do not think even that would have made this film watchable. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, is horrible here - he seems to lack intelligence and courage. That's enough for that.
