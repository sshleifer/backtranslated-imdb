This movie was made for TV, so taking that into account, I will not rip it as hard as it would make a movie. The script is insignificant, but it manages to be slightly humorous on certain points, whether or not it is. The acting is mostly exaggerated, but this is true for many low budget films. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie that I really hated, though, was that 90-95% of it is filmed on film, but in random places, there will be 5 to 10 seconds where footage is recorded on video. You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the images are clearly 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second. I'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be filmed later and back then they did not have the money to shoot (I suppose that's why anyway) but it's disorienting and it really makes the movie look more shoddier <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I definitely would not say I liked this movie and I can not recommend anyone to see it.
