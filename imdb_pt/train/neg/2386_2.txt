I missed this movie in the movies, but I had an idea in the back of my head that it was worth taking a look, so when I saw it on the DVD shelves I thought "time to watch." Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can not save this turkey, certainly one of the worst movies of all time. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Perhaps it made more sense if I had read Robbins' novel, but unless the film was completely different from the novel, and with Robbins helping in the script I doubt it, the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well. I hope the actors have been well paid, as they seemed embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and, more recently, DVDs, for example, Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times. <br /> <br /> Save around 98 minutes of your life for something more interesting, such as trimming your toenails or tidying up the drawer of your socks. Even when you see it in the bin for less than $ 5 at your local store, resist it!
