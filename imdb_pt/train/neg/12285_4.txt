The plot is absurd and lame, also sucking are performances and dialogue, it is difficult to keep our eyes open. I advise you to have a friend propelled to caffeine by hand to wake you up in time for a couple of Gore effects. Why do they bring Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes increasingly difficult to swallow. All this time, I wondered who this movie was meant for - filled with lame subplots (like cannibalism US Army-captain). This is of low quality in all respects. This movie is banned in Germany!
