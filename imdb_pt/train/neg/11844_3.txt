Anyone who is a sucker for jazz from the 1920s, to the 1920s, to Charleston and to the ultra-stylish yachts (eg, I, in all respects) will want to like this movie. But the sad thing is that's all. The plot is banal and obvious, acting mostly or horrible or throwing to the far side of events, and when the whole thing is there is not much left the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a bad movie beautifully done.
