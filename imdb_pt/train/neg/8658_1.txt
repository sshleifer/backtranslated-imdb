A large part of the scenes must be cut. There are many scenes that should have been cut. For example, the scene where the hunters mention "I have spiders on my dick", "I like dick," playing in the mud scene, or a bar scene where a professional dinocroco hunter is a snake charmer. <br /> <br /> How about other terribly incoherent scenes with a woman, Diane who wants to lose her virginity with a boyfriend who walks like he wears three very small sizes. While they make love, did they not realize that they are getting on the side of the little boy who soon will flee and lose his head? Why did they do it in a living room? I mean, his head really turned. How about the beach scene very reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene on Grant Lake. All these strange scenes could easily be dubbed and announced as a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my hometown, movie theaters have been announcing for months on Dinocroc, and I'm glad I did not watch it because I later discovered it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before being canceled . The movie was so bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview. It features the Dinocroc leg that looks like a toddler wearing green pajamas and flip-flops and walks up and down like a 2 year old. It could be easily ignored as Baby Geniuses. If any film student wants to learn what not to do, it's a real classic rubbish. Like Diane's boyfriend who walks as if he has an advanced case of syphilis, you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before drinking beer. When that happens, who cares about Dinocroc? The man in the panties looked more interesting than the whole Dinocroc movie. His acting was so bad, he makes a much better replacement for Mr. Bean. CHANGE ABOUT ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror-fiction film. Maybe the worst cast in Hollywood history.
