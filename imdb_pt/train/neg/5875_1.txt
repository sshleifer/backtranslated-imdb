This film deals with two former football players who are Fred Williamson, (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), who work as private detectives and meet all kinds of women and men with some bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife, Vanity (Jennifer Derringer), who works on sexual conversations over the phone. Jennifer is being threatened by an interlocutor who wants to do horrible things with her and asks for her help along with several other women. Mack and Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Florida. golf courses or get off at a Sports Bar where all sorts of things in the city continue. There are many punches, murders and many double meaning words that bring this film completely to a great ZERO. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me only 50 cents and that was too much.
