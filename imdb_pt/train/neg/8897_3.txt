I remember when I first saw this movie, it was sixth grade when it happened. Before seeing this, I had listened to the original Broadway recording and really loved it! But when I saw this, I was like, what the hell ?! This movie is missing many of the musical's songs to scream out loud! Who decided to do all this?! <br /> <br /> I really am a big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical he has ever done! The film looked more like a Hollywood setting than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who the hell decided to cut all of Meg's songs out of the movie? <br /> <br /> I am willing to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe were probably asking themselves, "Who in the world decided to do this with our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if they did, they were probably angry that Hollywood had turned their big musical into that somewhat blank film. <br /> <br /> Music and acting wise Mr. Kelly, you went through hearing with flying colors, but you are in a movie that is missing much of the text. <br /> <br /> So, in short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
