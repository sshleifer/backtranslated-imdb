"Attack of the Assassin Tomatoes" consists mainly of poorly spaced and poorly mounted scenes in search of a movie. The plot does not make sense, and the various characters enter and leave the picture without any explanation. Watching this silly parody, you get the feeling that many other reviews have captured so accurately: that it's easy to make a cheap, low-quality movie and use the "parody" angle as an excuse for its low price and low quality In a scene , female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them, as far as the "suspension of disbelief" can go - even in a parody? The title song is great, though. (* 1/2)
