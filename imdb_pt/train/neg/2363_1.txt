This movie was simply terrible, the first movie was not so good, I mean it's ridiculously stupid if they did not have enough of the first 5 movies you had to add another, why not do it in a series like James Bond. , I'll tell you exactly why, because the bonus movies are actually very good and these movies just stink, I do not understand, this should be a cross between genres like terror and comedy for the love of God my 1 year old niece would not have afraid of such a ridiculous attempt at horror, a spit in the face of people who at least want to be afraid at some point of a so-called horror movie. Please, no more of these movies.
