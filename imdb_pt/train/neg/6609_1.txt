I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever, because I have not seen all the Bollywood movies, but my imagination tells me it could be just as well. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like an artistic attempt. suicide on behalf of the director, and I believe he has been successful in his mission. No top-notch actor out of this movie would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation that this movie is forced to upload. <br /> <br /> But let's not blame the director here, there's the director of photography, who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year. There is the most dramatic score, which hopes to lead you to the next scene. The man of enlightenment, who must have held a cigarette in one hand and a lamp in the lamppost in the other, hoping that the flame that burned the cigarette would increase the light needed in every scene. And, of course, the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, otherwise all could be forgiven here. The set of actors at Aag were put together to promote a fresh start and dimension for the reworking of India's most beloved film of all time, "Sholay." Do not forget that these actors were not forced to participate in this film, they are an A-list and participants willing to something that, frankly, would certainly have a high and anxious public expectation ??? So this raises the question, Amitabh aside (for now), do the other actors really believe that their performances have tried to improve on the original? Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believed that people would remember their dialogue in this ridiculous freak of a movie? Do not be stupid, of course he did not do it, it was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks can get the actors to walk. <br /> <br /> I really hope everyone involved is satisfied with what it really is. a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film that only manages to pollute the minds of all when they watch the original film.
