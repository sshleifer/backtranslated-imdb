What a bad movie, bad !!! I can not believe all the hype that was spent on this pretentious and amateurish excuse for a real movie !! I left the theater before the end, shocked at how bad the direction and camera work of that movie were !! And to read the beloved sticks that claim there is truth and reality in this film, when all that is in reality is a blatant attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of critics and festivals for being cheap and in bad taste. <br /> <br /> At least this movie has shown me, once and for all, that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke, and that being shown here is yet another label of poor filmmaking than any other thing. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You'll want your time back! I know I did.
