I am a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I would not hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my all-time favorite actresses, so I entered this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely useless movie that is not going anywhere. Of course, no one would want much more, but the fact that it's useless becomes more annoying when you consider that it's a little boring, too, and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case, one who steals, makes women and smuggles things. This is basically the whole plot this movie has. The film has a true 'seventy' style and the idea of ​​everything being very carefree is good. Sometimes it seems that directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to come up with some kind of point, although whatever the point, it does not go very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and that's the case here too; she is definitely the best thing about the movie and the sequence in which it comes out of a bare car is the best part of the movie. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal to people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it has not much to offer.
