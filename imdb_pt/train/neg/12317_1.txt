I'm sorry for the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slowly, badly released and misinterpreted, it is a movie that tries to escape the raids of the last years and to fail! McDonald and Parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless. They seem to be in for any pay they are getting for this and not because they thought it was a good idea. The plot is full !! I love great girl movies as much as the next girl and this is not one !! If you avoid a movie this year .... let it be
