After having watched Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it, I finally got a chance to see his sequence, Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed, because I could hardly stand the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of ​​a good movie. Philip Glass's score for him had neither the beauty nor the correlated strength of the former. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this movie seemed slow and meaningless. A diluted version of Baraka, which is the same idea, but made better. I really hope that the third film in this series does not follow the example of this waste.
