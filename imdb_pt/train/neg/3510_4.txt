I watched this movie recently on DVD and have to say that I was not impressed. I know it's a taboo to tap independent movies, but this one is devoid of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the execution was short. I found myself thinking "okay, they're just getting started, the story will catch on soon". Before I knew it, the movie was over and history never caught on. I can not say that I also found the performance so impressive. It was really bad. No Star Wars prequel trilogy bad, but bad, however. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the run time was, I'll take two hours (because it's a safe estimate). Anyway, when the movie ended, I felt I deserved some kind of recognition for the willpower I exercised in not stopping the movie and walking out of the way. <br /> <br /> Once again, I was totally impressed, and eventually bored out of my wits. I'm not one of those guys that demands quick action and explosions in a movie, so do not start at me as being a reason not to like it.
