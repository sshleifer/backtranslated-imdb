When I first heard of "Solar Crisis" then I got a cast load, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. Then I saw. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For a film that covers outer space, the sun, vast deserts and metropolis, this is a very tight and claustrophobic feature. ; it seems that everyone is very close so that the camera does not have to backtrack much. <br /> <br /> And the effects, though good, are well below expectations; we are talking about the imminent destruction of planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers can not divert from a deadly solar explosion. But apart from screaming, sweating and having a red glow about everything, there is no real sense of emergency. <br /> <br /> Do not make me start talking about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle and others are doing in this film, without even bothering to think about the material, is something no one knows. It makes you wonder who else condominiums are not paid for in Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> And how far is the end .... Well let's just say it's tense and intriguing, but it's too late in an effort like this. If I'd kept that sort of rhythm all through the movie, maybe I'd heard of "Solar Crisis" earlier. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly because of lost opportunities and bad career moves. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his job doing things like that?
