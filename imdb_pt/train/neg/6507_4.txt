You know this is going to be a rough movie when: 1. It was made in the 50's 2. It's in black and white. 3. No name actors! 4. Screaming compensates for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well, it should not be surpassed - this movie brilliantly incorporated all four elements above to turn this into a true cinematic mistake. <br /> <ok - shhhhh but I'm going to discuss special effects here - or the lack of them - <br /> Have you seen the underwater scenes? It looks like it was filmed badly through an aquarium - notice the cover slamming in the breeze. <br /> <br /> And the repeated re-use of the videos (shots from outside houses, the big bridge scenes have improved KRAF-Tiness of this film - not since "PLAN 9" - I saw this creative use of stock footage <br /> <br /> Hey, where there was a lack of special effects - do not worry - shouting <br /> <br /> The special effects place in this movie too <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie even cleverly used that old hacking trick <br /> < <br /> <br /> Take the popcorn - put your brain in the stun (several fermented drinks DEFINITELY help), sit down, and ask: why the hell did they put it in the movie again? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
