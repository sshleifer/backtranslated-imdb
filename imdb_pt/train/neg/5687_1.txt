While not as bad as your movie adaptations, this piece of bread does not do much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he does not make good films. One of these days he will run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his bombs. <br /> <br /> The performance was unsatisfactory, the dialogue sounded as if they were reading TelePrompTers and Boll's special little 'touches'. Like all of Uwe Boll's films, this should not exist. <br /> <br /> Pure and simple. <br /> <br /> like Uwe Boll himself should not exist. > _>
