Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he goes to Malta, where he shoots more people. He gets stuck too often to photograph people. Then he goes into a shootout with the bad guy, who is dressed like a monk. There's a boat chase and Joe Don ends up in jail again. Finally, Joe Don, with the help of Elaine from "Seinfeld", kills the villain, blows up a boat or two and someone is shot with a flare. All this is a captivating theme song, just like Mitchell!
