I can not say enough bad things about this train accident. It's one of the few movies I've been tempted to leave. It was a bad premise to begin with, the first pregnant male, but then they tried to make a parody of it. What were they fooling all those really pregnant men? This was the worst movie I've ever seen. If I had enough votes, it would be in the bottom of the IMDB 100. If it were possible to give a zero I would, and I would still feel that I had given a lot of credit.
