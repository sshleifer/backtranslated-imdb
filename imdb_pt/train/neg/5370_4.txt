Råzone is a horrible movie! It's so simple. Looks like they tried to make a movie to show the life of the reel. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark does not have good young actors. Leon is still, by many, the little girl of "Jul krummernes," and Laura simply is not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays soulless and this is destroying the movie! <br /> <br /> Even though I consider a movie you should see. I do not agree that young people are behaving like this, but I think this can show how this can end if you are disappointing your child. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies like "Film folket"! <br /> <br /> In short, I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a great movie, but because it's a movie that deals with important themes. I also think it's important to point out that there are some violent scenes, and it's actually in those scenes that Laura is acting better. - like the end where she's holding the gun!
