Ivan Reitman is a kind of savior. The weary plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in their skilful hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows signs of life and humor that are worth seeing. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not have a rather original plot (man plays superhero, superhero is avenged with superpowers) and turns him into something nice. "Girlfriend" is an exercise in uselessness. The plot of a trick pony is long on the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film can not decide whether it will be romantic comedy or superhero drama. The result is a movie, the flip-flops between the two, with neither aspect being very well done. Uma Thurman is at the top, as usual, and Luke Wilson also plays the role, though her antics get tired quickly. What's even more maddening is that in certain scenes (such as when a closely linked Uma touches the head of a wall), you notice a witty and strident work by Reitman practically screaming out. But seconds later, the magic is lost, as fast as the superhero, whose films disappoint in almost every way.
