When great conversations between director and actor are commented, the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not mentioned. Probably because the production of nine joint ventures between the two ranges from really good action entertainment to the mediocre. Unfortunately Kinjite: Forbidden Affairs falls in the latter. <br /> <br /> This is sad because Kinjite could have been so much better. But for my life, I do not understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl, a guy who used to have a few moments of fun because the romance in his marriage is over. This might have been good for another movie, but it served no purpose here. <br /> <br /> A direct drama with Charles Bronson as a police officer who has seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against the Orientals. This part could also have used a little explanation. But he will have to overcome it if he and his partner, Perry Lopez, find a girl from the Japanese school captured. <br /> <br /> Bronson's time in the squadron told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A killer and stylish pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have a bit of history. In fact, in the best scene of the film, Bronson made him eat an expensive Rolex watch and set fire to his car. <br /> <br /> At one point, Fernandez meets Bronson and Lopez at a deli all night and after that his rolex snack, he sprays the place with a Uzi killing everyone but Bronson and Lopez. I really think this little incident would have more than two Los Angeles police officers after Fernandez. But this is another terribly big hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> There is still a very tough justice in the end for Fernandez. I wish the whole movie had been better. This was the last film of the team of Bronson-Thompson and the last one of J. Lee Thompson like director. He should have come out with something better.
