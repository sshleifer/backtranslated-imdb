If you love "Pulp Fiction" and like portable cameras, you should love this movie. I liked the quirky story (though I think "Pulp Fiction" was the most overrated film since "The English Patient") and found the characters unrealistic, but interesting. It is not "seaside" or "citizen Kane" and is overwhelmed by European pretension. But the worst part is by far the handheld camera. It's so disturbing and annoying that I found myself desperately waiting for the movie to end. I do not know why the new directors think this method of filming is so good. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, the camera in hand will leave you nauseous in about 10 minutes.
