This movie made me very angry. I desperately wanted to strangle the "scientists" and invisible filmmakers during the course. Very painful to sit on. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. Little good information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of ​​new age sh * t horse. The worst criminals were the charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly imply that he, on the other hand, is living on a higher plane. Even the ideas and attitudes with which I basically agree are presented in such a heavy, awkward, superior, pretentious and preaching way that I felt the desire to deny them. I think that's what got me so angry, the fact that they took what in fact are deep aspects of established scientific thinking and ruined them with their new lifestyle. Much of this is based on the fallacy of applying concepts from quantum theory to the macro world. Appropriately, the dramatized portions with Marlee Matlin are amateurs and cliches. <br /> <br /> I would like to refer people to Bill Bryson's excellent study of science: "A Brief History of Almost Everything." There is much profound wonder about life and the universe in current and established science.
