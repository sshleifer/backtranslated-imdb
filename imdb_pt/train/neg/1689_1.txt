Wow, what a total disappointment! The fact that people find this movie scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct violation of "The Ring". The story? There was a? Not in my opinion .. Just a lot of flashy images. The whole movie was a boring and stupid mess. I think there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror movie I've seen in years. And that girl, Buffy? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and so talented ... No, wait, that would be an insult to Barbie's talents! I suppose a lot of kids helped this movie at the box office as it was PG-13, and if it had been rated R, it would have bombarded IMO! Stupid movie!
