As the original excites the intellect, this cheap remake is designed just to shock the sensibilities. Instead of intricate twists and turns, this so-called thriller features sudden and seemingly random story shifts that serve only to further lower it to every bizarre development. Worst of all is that replacing the original and spicy dialogue is an upset jar, full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving behind an austere but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was promise - promise not fulfilled. The prospect of Michael Caine making a graduation similar to Patty Duke, like Keller-to-Sullivan, is intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor just tarnished his reputation by first accepting the role in this terribly rewritten absurdity and then turning it into a performance that only seems competent when compared to Jude Law's amateur overcoming. If you have not seen the original classic, ignore its dated visuals and tricks. Hunt, watch and enjoy a story and a half. As for the remake, pass this insult to the original.
