This may well be the worst movie I'll ever see if I live to the 100's. I think a group of first grade students could have a better plot as a class project than that. I'm dumber for watching, and God has mercy on the souls that have been paid to produce this movie. <br /> <br /> And after I finally hung up, I really wanted to vomit. Nobody had a clue about photography when they did this. No one had a clue about acting. Nobody had a clue about anything. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that F / X shows this crap once in a while. The only time I saw it was in one of the Starz! channels - not even the main one. And it was about 3 o'clock in the morning.
