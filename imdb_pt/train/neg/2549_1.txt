My friend bought the movie for 5 ?? (not worth a dime), because they wrote that it was like an American pie. but we'd soon discover that there's a long way from the American pie to that piece of crap. it's not even a comedy, it's more like a really bad documentary. not only is the story bad, the image and sound are bad too. they put on some drunken alcohol, puppies, dwarves and teens. and the result is a disaster. If you see this movie, do not buy, instead spend your money on something else, and better. If you will torture yourself, then do not invite your friends unless you hate them a lot and want to get rid of them.
