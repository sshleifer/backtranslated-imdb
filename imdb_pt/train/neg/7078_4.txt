This movie could have been a decent B movie if 3/4 of the film was not very focused on the sex scenes. I mean, he's a sex addict, and I'm sure there's a lot more going on with sex addicts than having sex all the time. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what he had to do, which was not much. At one point or another, someone would have to laugh at him because his character was so pitiful. Nastassja Kinski was well into her role of sex therapist, she could have done more and I'm not suggesting she have sex. The person who most stood out to me in this film was Rosanna Arquette in her compelling role as the loving and worried wife. There is something beautiful inside and out that attracts me strongly. She played that role and as you watched the movie, you start to feel bad for her. "Diary of a sex addict," though not an Oscar material or a modern classic by anyone's standards, is quite informative and does a good job at showing you how personal demons can take on and ruin the same things in life that you think a lot.
