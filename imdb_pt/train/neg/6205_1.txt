Then they exalted the violence and were labeled as sick. Well, violence is the best part I'm afraid of, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they continue to act (fully predictable). This movie has a truly terrible script. We never get a chance to meet Robert and his actions in the end are simply pathetic. The acting is not much better either, the worst being the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is awkward, the pace enough to send you to sleep. And what the hell is the school movie project? A comment about the movie itself, maybe? The use of news during the climax murder is laughable. These guys obviously think they are intellectuals, but they are hopelessly out of their depth. How on earth they managed to ignite the great Yorgos Arvanitis, I will never know. And how they got the money to do it in the first place is an even bigger mystery. Absolutely awful beyond comprehension.
