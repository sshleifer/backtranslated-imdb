Thank God I watched this at a friend's house and I did not pay for it. The plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie looked like an episode of a TV show. If you have some knowledge of computers or electronics, beware. You will feel as if the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> In addition, actress turned Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh exhibits the worst performance I've ever seen, excluding pornography. She's lucky that Matt Lanter is really decent. He's the one who carries the movie. <br /> <br /> I hate to have wasted almost two hours of my life watching this movie! It's a shame that they called a follow up because I was a fan of the original, which was actually pretty good.
