This movie did not have big stars, but it had a great cast full of excellent supporting actors and Gene Tierney before becoming a great star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you'd expect more from the film than it actually delivered. Most of this, I suspect, is because of a second-rate script, since director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man in charge. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in East Africa during World War II. - just before the Americans went to war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while subversive Nazi elements are trying to cause trouble among the locals. One of the white men in the movie is a double dealer - working for the destruction of the British Empire! But, lovely Tierney, playing the daughter of a sultan (!), Wants to help save the day of good old Britain. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers have long been associated with the Empire, and the 1930s and 40s saw a multitude of pro-empire films. Nowadays, with the change of sensibility, the idea of ​​seeing the happy black natives dying for Queen and country seems ridiculous - and it would be difficult to cheer for either side! Still, in his time, this piece of propaganda was effective in enlisting support for the British - although when viewed today, the film suffers from a long script and a silly cast. The only bright moment in the movie is the final confrontation between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad that after such a potent scene the film seemed to speak and speak - losing some of its impact.
