I am not a regular spectator of Springer, but I watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a good guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. So of course, I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored". First of all, Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the movie's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes is spent constructing this pseudo-farce about the garbage of the trailer, jealousy, incest and deceit. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot as HELLLL) is a prostitute who sleeps with her stepfather (a drunken, very unusual-looking Michael Dudikoff who eventually strays from his acting hero persona). The mother finds out about the affair, they get into a fight, they want to take him to the show "Jerry" (that's right, not Springer). And then we have a side story with an African-American couple. They lead to the show "Jerry". Characters collide. Blah, blah, damn, blah! Trash was rarely this BORRRINGG !!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them checked out his movie. Well, now it's TOTALLY obvious !! If you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of a movie (if that's what you call it). It is so poorly edited, with scenes that simply do not connect, and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and is simply across the map! Imagine a predictable novel transformed into a comic farce. With rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot girl scene. This is as bold as possible. Do not get me wrong, the scene is pretty risky, but if you look at the movie in general compared to the material on the Springer show - this disastrous farce looks extremely hygienic. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
