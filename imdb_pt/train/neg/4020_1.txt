I will never be a member of any club that had me, especially this one. <br /> <br /> Starr Andreeff is a single mom / stripper who is attacked by a vampire and left to die. She begins to yearn for blood, and meets up with John Savage, seeming to be wondering where he left Michael Cimino's phone. Savage is also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join his little vampire family, which consists of a British vampire, the blond vampire who attacked Starr, and a dwarf (I'm not doing this <br /> <br />). <br /> <br /> The family does not want Starr, so they try to kill Savage and Starr <br /> and Starr's son. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama. He spends most of his time on the screen displaying more facial tics than Hugh Grant in a Jolt Cola folder, and he reads all his lines as <br /> <br /> He's making a movie of the Farrelly brothers. Andreeff tries to play the most badly written role, but scriptwriter / director Ruben goes to all vampire cliches, like Starr eating his son's hamster <br/ <> and buying too much raw meat to fight the desire for blood. The boy is also attacked a lot, for those who think watching violence against children is really fun. <br /> <br /> The film is extra bloody. , but not in a wild way, like "Killer <br /> <br /> Tongue." Here, blood is rude and never justified, just occurs. <br /> <br /> It's just in the budget. Most of the R-rating goes to Andreeff's co-workers, who undergo embarrassing striping routines in the background of the conversation scenes. The budget does not include vampire prey! All the vampires here need to stab their prey to eat. <br /> <br /> Good idea, unless you've already seen George Romero's "Martin." <br /> <br /> Even at 77 minutes, and once you toss Ruben's attempts at artistic direction (distorted pictures, blurred scenes), this is a tiresome, monotonous and dirty ride. Leave this club and take a shower, you'll need it. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, armed violence, sexual violence, strong gore, strong profanity, female nudity, sexual references, drug abuse and adult situations. <br /> <br />
