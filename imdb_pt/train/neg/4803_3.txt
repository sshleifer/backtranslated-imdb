Adrianne, you really should have a life without Mr. "Brady". She makes me nauseous and has been one of the main reasons why I know the show the most. It is a show without a brain, and every small argument or disagreement seems to be placed under the scope and analyzed to the death. This makes them look / sound nothing more than ready for marriage, yet I know that these disagreements are a part of life. I think for some people this is entertainment. If this happens next season, I will feel sorry for those who have nothing better to do with their life, but look at this garbage. Although I would not be terribly surprised. can no longer support commercials for this program! I hope they are getting enough money to embarrass themselves constantly in front of a camera week after week. However, girl "A" has a great ass!
