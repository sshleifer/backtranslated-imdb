As the cover says "The village of our time, for our time". <br /> <br /> I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was really a disappointing experience. /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to various aspects of the piece, including sexuality; a very homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think at the time (60's) this was a very well done version of Hamlet, but it does not compare to the full version of Branagh. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found the video on my local video store (in Australia) and I'm really looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy, if there is such a thing. If anyone knows of one please tell me.
