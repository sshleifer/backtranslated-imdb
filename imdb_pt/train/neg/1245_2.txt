Absolutely Burton's worst film, which seems to be getting worse with every movie he directs. A miserable script laden with clich√©s is only the first of many objectionable aspects of this film. This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone yell "he's lost the gun!" or whatever it is for all to know. Carter is really awful and Wahlberg too, who can not interpret this right and be convincing. Very good effects and photography, but bad music in the mold of John Williams, by Elfman, a Burton companion. Heston appears in a senseless scene to release his most famous sentences from the first film. Very poor results. If anyone else out there also saw "Sleepy Hollow," they probably have noticed, like me, the decadent quality of Burton's movies. I have heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was hired as director, in which case his trial should be questioned. But I think he allowed any possible vision he could have had at the beginning of his career escaped; the evidence is there in the movies. In "Sleepy Hollow," he could not decide what kind of film he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of British character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) also made you think it was a kind of monstrous rally movie (these are never scary, as horror fans know). The film could not succeed in horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style was developed to soften the two together. "Planet of the Apes" is almost the same, and the result looks more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" than with sci-fi. He also fell into the rut of so many other "big" directors trying to satisfy every possible audience. Tell Burton, if you're out there - pick something up and do it right, or use some style to put it all together (as in "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") or you can retire because people like me who are fans of your movies will stop going.
