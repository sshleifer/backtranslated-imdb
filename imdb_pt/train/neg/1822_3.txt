Greetings again from the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed two of my all-time favorites in "Avalon" and "Diner". He also had some good movies ("Rainman"), but always provided something of interest ... until now. I believe the worst thing you can say about comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of annoying. Never a big fan of pure slap ("Dumb and Dumber"), I was impressed by how horrible this movie is. There are maybe two laughs on the whole thing - if you can pay attention for so long. The best part of the movie is the joke of the title song of a Redbone sound. If the film had been written like the music, it would have been tolerable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize that everyone wants to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes a weakness. SNL cast member Amy Poehler is always on top of her role as the trash in the amusement park that turned out to be a princess. The film's disaster is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work together is a bit promising, but after that the chemistry disappears because of the unsatisfactory script. This script is like most of the ideas of Jack Black's character - not a bad thought, but no hope of success.
