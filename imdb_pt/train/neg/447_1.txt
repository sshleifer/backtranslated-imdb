Well, what can you say about sitcoms. There are often quite lame, moral and simply dedication. So it's this show! It has a boring cast, though A.Bynes is okej on his merry way, the rest is just a stereotypical crap ... as usual. We've all seen this before, and we'll probably see it all again when this show is canceled. Because, let's face it, it's a mediocre show and a fair car. Like most sitcoms are .... Well, in short. If you want to see good entertainment, you can take a break for 20 minutes in front of the mirror. Make some faces and move on ... It's more fun than this show!
