This was an odd kind of movie about a low-life New York life centered around a main character (the title name, played by Brad Pitt), who thinks he's a Ricky Nelson type musician, except he does not has real talent. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch even a New York City-type woman in a horrible accent, step in and take control. That ruined the movie for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who often plays tough, stuffy-mouth women. The hairdo on Pitt-an exaggerated Pompadour-was fun to look at. I can imagine Johnny Depp playing that part better. One last note: It's strange to hear a movie made in 1992 (unlike Woody Allen) with just mono sound.
