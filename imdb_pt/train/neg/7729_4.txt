A wonderful mini-TV series completely ruined by a 45-year-old woman desperately trying to be a naive 16-year-old! No exaggeration - this is the REAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the movie is released shortly before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. This mini TV series is really the most classic example of the title of this post and one that I refer to whenever the subject is addressed. <br /> <br /> This by itself makes this totally unacceptable, despite being one of the best filmed WWII 'global' TV dramas ever produced. If you have a stomach - or a decent fast-moving ability - you can take advantage of the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am shocked by some of the comments pertaining to the love story (pun intended). Did they watch the movie with their eyes closed? Or they are aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision." I'm a Boomer, so do not think for a second that I'm an arrogant punk young man. 45 SEE ALWAYS 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully damnit. <br /> <br /> The Winds Of War could have been ... so good. How much more would we be talking about this mini-series today, about 25 years later, had a real recipe in such an important and critical role? Now, with the constant old biddy distraction, this alone negates most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War.
