Oh familiar story about the understated good guy Paul (Jason Lee) who, after the night of his bachelor party, wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), a sexy blonde he met the night before. After lying about it to his fianc√©e Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of us have witnessed such a story at least once before ... in the movie or on TV. The film is stereotyped and EXTREMELY predictable, with an ending that you can see coming up a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least the cast provides some interest and keeps you watchable. Lee is well on the lead, and Stiles is a lot of fun in a carefree comedic role, unlike the very serious roles she usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs just as often as other people change into clothes. <br /> <br /> But, you know, this is not exactly well written. At least one question is left unanswered: what, exactly, is Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend Ray (Lochlyn Munro) being investigated by AI? <br /> <br /> And I did not like Buck's character. (David Koechner), stepfather of Paul; He's a super-detestable idiot who got on my nerves so fast that I was begging someone to punch him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: a free and un-featured entry from comedian / actor Larry Miller, again playing a grumble (in this case, it's a bit justified - your character is an ultraconservative minister). <br /> <br /> Nothing good, but as usual for me, I give him three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast alone.
