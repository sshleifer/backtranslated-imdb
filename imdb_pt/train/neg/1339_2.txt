A sad and sad sight is, in fact, The Revenge of the Munster. The Munsters are brought back one last time (Fred Gywnne received a huge salary to go back to the role of Herman Munster) in this made-for-TV movie about a pair of wax replicas of grandpa and Herman who are robots "terrorizing" the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy's hideout at an exhibition. With the police at their heels, the two old television icons try to find out who is really behind the crimes in order to clear their names. We get to see them dressed as waitresses (a little high point in the movie), grandpa turns into a wired bat attached a few times (once even flying to Transylvania with Herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles, I guess ), and a more irritating relative "the ghost" constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium! What is sadder is hard to identify: it is that Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis seem so downcast in every scene and so indifferent to the material. Are the gullies of the robots that have these school production values ​​on them? Maybe it's the ridiculous script. The follies of Sid Caesar, most bland. Or maybe you're seeing something that brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super-fashionable K-Mart fashion. At any time, the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even by Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is fit in a very empty role (though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience). K. C. Martell makes an ever so affable Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is a handsome Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the Ghost mentioned above looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd way. The film has a real cheap feel about it, even for a movie made for TV.
