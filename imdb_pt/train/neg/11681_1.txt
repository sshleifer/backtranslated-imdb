The trailers in this movie were better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. I wish I had waited for this movie to come on DVD, because at least I would not be out of $ 9. The movie totally missed the mark. What could have been a great movie for all the actors, turned out to be a B movie at best. The movie moved VERY slowly and when I thought I was going somewhere, it almost did, but it did not happen. These days, we need unpredictable twists and turns in movies, and this movie did not offer either. The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good, however, I'm not sure if it was the way it was directed, the lighting, the delivery lines, the writing or the what, but nothing came of it. Very hype for nothing. I was very disappointed with this movie, and I'm telling everyone not to see it. Cheesy saxophone music also made the movie worse. And the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
