Bollywood fans have a lot to do with Mard from Amitabh Bachan, but I think it's very overrated. Manmohan Desai previously collaborated on such films as Suhaag, Parvarish, Anthony Akbar, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie, and I saw them all like it, so I had very high expectations before seeing Mard and being bitterly disappointed. My main complaint about Mard is that it looks like Amar Akbar Anthony part 2, maybe Mr. Desai had no ideas, after all he used this formula years and years ago. 1. First of all, some members of the cast are repeated from the AAA, for example, the police inspector who exposes Amar, the Muslim who leads Akbar, Nirupa Roy and a few others. 2. At AAA Nirupa Roy loses sight, in Mard she loses her voice 3. At AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba) right in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. Having seen AAA for over 1000 times I noticed this right away. <br /> <br /> My other complaints are that some of the situations seem ridiculous, true Manmohan Desai did leave his brain in the door kind of movies, but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last complaint is that, compared to the songs from the previous Manmohan Desai films, I found the songs quite disappointing. I know there are a lot of fans who swear, but I did not like it at all. It actually hurts me to write this review because I'm a big fan and I've loved his movies since I was a kid.
