I picked up TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We considered taking a trip east and thought that would give us an idea of ​​what it was like. The movie was a total waste of time, if I went out to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw it cost $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD lasted 8 minutes and showed a mountain- russian across Canada with my stomach feeling bad as they climbed and came tumbling down with the movie at high speed. <br /> <br /> There have been many scenes that they probably recorded about this and you would think they could have made a better product. If I had done this project, I would have to provide more images, pause traffic signals so people would know where they were and stay in places to see the landscape. To make a film like this should be 60 to 90min. Oh yeah, the case said it was in stereo, the whole movie was a whistling sound of the car's sound, which could at least put some music in it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good cross film Canada watch The railrodder / National Film Board of Canada starring Buster Keaton (the last film he made) in this comedic movie Buster Keaton arrives at a rail trackpeeder in the Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia
