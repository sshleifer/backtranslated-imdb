What was this? Pre-destination, you can not change the future because it was already written ?? <br /> <br /> I'll give it all away. I wanted to see what happened next, and so I watched the whole movie. This film took a concept and made it watchable. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a recommendation, check it out at matinee prices. No emotion, but an interesting concept. They should have left the Y2K reference out ....
