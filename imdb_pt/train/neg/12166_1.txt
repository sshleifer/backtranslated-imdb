Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, she's related to Bruce), the killer of the first movie, is back to her old tricks again. She is one of the advisors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls in the camp are cool and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing are fine. But a few steps beyond the line and Angela kills them - making bad jokes all the time. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and nasty splatter movie, but it had some good points for it. This is vicious and unpleasant too, but it does not have good points for it. The plot was made to death and this adds nothing to the formula. There are many bloody murders here (people are burned alive, heads are cut, throats cut), but all blood is so obviously false that it actually becomes comic. This also has the fewest campers I have ever seen and pretty much everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is free female nudity (provided here by the tremendously untapped Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl / good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the only exception of Springsteen and Higgins, the acting sucks - even with horror movie standards. There is also a cruel advantage to this movie in which a character is drowned in a latrine! Dull and sick with a stupid plot, mindless nudity and bad gore. Skip this.
