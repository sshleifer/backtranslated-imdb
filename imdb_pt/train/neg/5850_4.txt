Nell Shipman attempted a plot to lead to a final chase in last year's 'Back to God's Country', and she failed miserably. This time she does it better, though it seems pointless. 'Something New' hardly has a plot outside the chase. There is a brief premise, which defines the hero (co-author and boyfriend of Shipman) having to save the girl (played by Shipman), then it is nothing more than an exciting and implausible chase from there. Of course it works as an hour-long ad for a Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is congruously ridiculous. It does not seem like she learned much from D.W. Griffith's late-night rescue films or her parodies of Mack Sennett and other comedians, which she is imitating. One point of interest is that Shipman writes and addresses himself to the film as the writer of the film's history, which features a writer (Shipman again), though it does not make it much smarter or humorous with that, even if she tries. Again, others pioneered the writer's joke in intertitles such as Anita Loos with "Wild and Woolly" or Frances Marion with "A Girl's Folly" (both from 1917). At least, Shipman gives the impression that she does not take herself or the movie seriously - or me. 'Something New', despite its claim, is banal.
