Definitely the product of young minds, this piece may well appeal to the 20's crowd, who is still trying to find their place in the world while obsessed with all the neuroses. However, I can not imagine that the heavy amount of looking narcissistic, banal humor or banal subject would be particularly appealing to anyone over 30 years. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom filmmakers obviously only have contempt for, are exaggerating in such absurd cartoons for comic effect, that they can not be relatable in any real way. <br /> <br /> However, it is necessary to give some stylistic points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video genre, and to use all conceivable editing tricks in the book in order to embellish a non-existent plot. . There are 2 points to remember here. First, be careful of the festival's darlings. Secondly, although we live in the youtube era, not all the accounts of their worldly lives deserve a great deal of treatment. But these young filmmakers have every right to make the film, and if another twenty and a few years can find something to identify with, better yet. However, I could not help thinking, at the end of this film, how this latest generation, now with the majority, will leave in the real world, which presents so many challenges and complications. At the age when every child is constantly assured of how special it is, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resilience and coping with adversity do not exactly seem to be the strength of this generation.
