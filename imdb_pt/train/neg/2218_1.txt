I admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view, almost 30 years after the making of this film and at the time of its conception, may have been a brilliant horror / suspense film. <br /> <br /> Beginning on Halloween night of 1968, Michael at the age of 6 commits the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and, 15 years later, flees and returns to his hometown to assassinate again. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it is clear that the film will follow a highly predictable basic and rudimentary path. . The beginning of each scene is easily predictable in the way it will end, while the music of each scene containing Michael (the killer) is exactly the same throughout the film, alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow. <br /> <For horror / suspense enthusiasts, there is a serious lack of blood / blood compared to modern movies, although I am not similar to the amount exhibited these days. A happier medium could have been found. <br /> <br /> Half an hour into the movie, no scene is unexpected. The acting for a horror / suspense film is quite typical of the era and therefore has no impact for modern enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> A plus for the film is slow motion and dark lighting that create a scary effect. atmosphere. A second positive would be the character of Michael's doctor, who provides clues to the likelihood of where the story might lead. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the star in Jamie-Lee Curtis is in the infancy stages of her acting career and therefore fails to provide a truly frightened central victim. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to rate this film as it was in its day, but from other horror films / suspense indeed the 1980s and, to a lesser extent, the 1990s, it is far from a truly great horror / thriller. <br /> <br /> I suggest you go ahead and find an 80's classic. Congratulations!
