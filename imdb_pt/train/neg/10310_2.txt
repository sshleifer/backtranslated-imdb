Lorenzo Lamas stars as some sort of CIA agent, who captures some exotic beauty called Alexa, kidnaps his daughter and forces her to fight her former employers. O.J. Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not-so-talented ensemble. I must admit that I am not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas or his films. He stinks. However, when compared to the coma wife of O.J. Simpson and Lamas, Kinmont, Lamas seems like one, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I just saw the CIA because of renewed interest around the O.J Simpson trial, you see why if your parents had cable and extras, you could not escape that movie. in 1994, you could go to an Amish community and some idiot would have it playing on your portable TV. The film itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intriguing, although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after fireballs and swapping would be a liner providing some unintended humor. Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic? <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (Bad)
