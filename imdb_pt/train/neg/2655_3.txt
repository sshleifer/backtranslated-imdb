** 1/2 for this Diane Keaton farce. <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Mrs. Keaton, enough with her philosophy and hats from Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> This movie is just too much Keaton's daughter, Sara, dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who could not be contacted by phone at first, since she was in the bag with her friend and had pulled the phone plug, grieves in a new way for those who suffer. <br /> <br /> She retires to the summer spot where all Sara's friends are staying. She cleans the house, sleeps for two days, and then begins to reveal things that should not be revealed. It seems that sweet Sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ended up marrying the latter. Besides, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. We are all now placed on this journey of guilt. <br /> <br /> His only hope is to find the elusive diary Sara kept. She also hopes that her boyfriend, Adam, who is a playwright, does not include all of this in another play. <br /> <br /> When the diary is found, it was written in Japanese. Sara had a Ph.D in this language. It's not great news for Mom when a piece of the diary is translated by a Japanese cook at a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Of course, everything seems to fit very well in the end. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from The Wizard of Oz. Every time Mom and Sara talked, they both uttered Surrender Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if that were not enough, during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning, Keaton tells Adam not to be another Woody Allen. in his film Interiors, where he tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman. Keaton also tries drugs with the group. Come on, folks, can we really believe that someone in their right mind could cry like this? <br /> <br /> Fair to mediocre summarizes this movie better.
