I watched this movie as I liked the plot, a group of strangers are kept in captivity trying to figure out how they are connected. <br /> <br /> The scenario and premise were obviously influenced by the first (and best) saw the film and although there was not much action, the story has progressed at a relatively good pace. There was a comedy of relief in the form of the two 'alpha-males' who fought and it was a welcome surprise (by me anyway) to see Melissa Joan Hart did not give up acting yet. <br /> <br /> Some things let down to me personally; 1. The pedophile was very characterized, making him excited by everything from children to corpses. <br /> <br /> 2. MJH's talk about his former police officer "getting into it" when, in fact, he was the least deserving person to be there, he had not contributed to the events leading up to the capture their. <br /> <br /> 3. The end ..... what kind of movie ends up in the middle of something going on? There was no resolution, no cliffhanger, no obvious end ... it just ends. <br /> <br /> And that's why I dropped two stars from my rating. The first 2 points I would let slip but not the end!
