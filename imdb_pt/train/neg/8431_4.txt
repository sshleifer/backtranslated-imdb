Although the actors do a compelling job of playing losers on the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify made me look at my watch in a mere 20 minutes of the movie (and more than once after that). The development of the plot is disjointed and slow, the verbal diarrhea of ​​the main character's only friend is almost unbearable, the basic quality of most of the character's actions and the arrogant manner they are dealing with is annoying. <br /> <br /> It is typical for Ventura Pons to feature grossly psychologically deficient characters. However, this false sociological analysis is a major step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters mistreat and despise each other for well-founded reasons that unfold during this film. In IDIOT LOVE we are forced to follow the intricacies of a truly subnormal intelligence as he pursues a severely depressed and detached woman. Supposedly this is due to his own depression, but the script does not support this. Am I not going to give the rest of the story just in case there is a masochist out there? Is he cured through his obsession or is the woman shocked by her own depression through her unwavering attention? Even if I had watched the whole thing, I was not forced to care about any of them for a moment. <br /> <br /> If you can overcome all this prejudice, ignorance, betrayal, bad dialogue, fragile philosophy, etc ?? the camera work was very good and seems to be something inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup also seemed to aim to show these players in a raw and brave light, as it is the worst I've ever seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her films (while in person she is really attractive). <br /> <br /> I suppose if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so that we may be grateful we are not a part of it, then Pons has achieved his goal. The flurry of almost identical sex scenes was a waste of film (if the actors had been filmed, but once in blue-green clothes, the background behind them might have been changed in the special effects studio for a pittance). It is true that I have heard much of the male audience squirming in their seats during this, but an objective view proves that it was not the true purpose of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and see something else.
