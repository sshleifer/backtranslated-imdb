I saw the movie tonight at a free show, and despite the fact that I did not pay a penny to see this movie, I still felt cheated. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this movie you are leaving a Benjamin in his place. The acting is awkward at best; Kiefer Sutherland calls his worst personage of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas seems to realize that he made a bad choice leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the time it took to film this turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity; she seems to be reading the lines of a teleprompter. And if you can not identify the "mole" in the first 20 minutes, then you have just landed on this planet from a world without TV and recycled stories. If you really want to see a good secret service thriller, rent in the line of fire.

Whatever your feelings about W, let's hope that happens. art "does not imitate life.
