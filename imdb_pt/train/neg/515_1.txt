Oh man is this bad movie. It flows horribly. The story is about a race car driver who is passionate about himself, and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this, does not love himself. He tries to get out of the contract and horrible, painfully dull gags happen. Jim Nabors seems to be sleeping, not acting. You will miss such Burt helpers as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stink. Loni Anderson's hair is absolutely scary, proving that tons of lacquer did not come out in the sixties. Or maybe that was a wig. Speaking of which, Burt's wig was not bad in this movie. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and the Bandit 2". Anyway, this movie is the worst movie of Reynolds cars, never, never, up there with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which fortunately had no sequel) are great funny movies. This is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, stinks. You'll like a Jackie Gleason villain who's fun to hate. And remember, this is not one of those fun movies to do. It is lousy, pure and simple. Even the outputs at the end were tiresome and boring, and worst of all, bland. And at least I forget, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before his rebirth years later in "Boogie Nights," another film that like "Deliverance" years ago shows that man can act very good when he has a decent platform to do this.
