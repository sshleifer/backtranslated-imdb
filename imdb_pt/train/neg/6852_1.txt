This movie is really unbelievable. I've seen a lot of cheap junk, especially very 'Full Moon' Pictures, but 'Dollman' is really hard. So much comes along: the laughable story, the actors always on the verge of parody and the special effects! How long I could talk about them! It's a very bad movie, but also one of the funniest. If you are a fan of bad movies to laugh at, you have to watch. And do not miss 'Dollman vs. Demonic Toys'. It's so much funnier and worse.
