I was intrigued to see how a 2008 film, little seen, somehow won the Oscar for best film of 2009 and thus went to see The Hurt Locker. unfortunately, all I got for the two hours invested was the ruthless confirmation that this film had been awarded purely for off-screen reasons. <br /> <br /> The direction and visual style of this film are some of the weakest. You'll never see. when she is not busy being a tribute to the Bourne Identity with the terrible and annoying "shaky cam", it shows all the characteristics of a second daytime novel in terms of lens. The "plot" is exhausting, characterizations are as well developed as comic ideas rejected by Beetle Bailey and dialogue - in cases where the film gives up being "minimalist" and for no apparent reason transforms one or two soldiers in certain gossip - is some of the worst ever recorded. in justice, the actors do their best in the circumstances, just not enough to obscure how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> The whole movie has the feeling that if it is meant to be some kind of "mockumentary" that they timed it was devoid of humor and therefore re-edited as best they could, as a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours in this movie they are two hours you never come back, and two hours lost you will regret for the rest of your life.
