This is unbelievably bad. Poor actors. You may say that they are trying very hard to polish a shit, but we all know that you can not. The writing is so obvious and easy, it's sad to see them try to sell it. Humor and rhythm are so laborious that it's hard to believe any of these good actors did it. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it is so bad that we are having difficulty looking away from the screen. We just have to know where this train goes. But that's only because we get on TV. If we had really paid for it, we would be angry. <br /> <br /> So it gets 2 stars for being at least amusingly / fascinatingly bad. And incidental music (unlike the indie soundtrack that tries too hard) is ridiculously reminiscent of a Scooby-Doo episode ... but not so good.
