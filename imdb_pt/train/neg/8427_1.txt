Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his arrogant and manipulative father, he was incredibly carefree and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation. <br /> <br /> This spin-off movie, on the other hand is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is successfully transferred to the movie. This film has a depressing and depressing tone that almost brought me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beat up in a pub (not in a comical way) is not my idea of ​​comedy, but it's definitely one of the reasons why fans of the TV series will not like this movie. The film was painfully bland except for the scene where Albert takes a bath in the sink and is seen by a neighbor. <br /> <br /> The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of tune and it makes me wonder if the producers of this film always bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always looked for respectable girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely invaluable in the TV series. In the movie, Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity increases. <br /> <br /> Most of the British sitcoms tend to be very monotonous, with the notable exception of the films ON THE BUSES (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself!). But, STEPTOE AND SON must rank well at the bottom of the stack, even below GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much clearer tone, is more faithful to the TV series and is actually very funny.
