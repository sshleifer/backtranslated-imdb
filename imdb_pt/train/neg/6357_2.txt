I'm so disappointed. This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy. Here was Woody Allen's quintessential film again: the upper-class neurotics of Manhattan debating whether or not to cheat on their spouses. Woody, I've seen these characters, I've seen the plot of you ten times. Where did your creativity go? You need to open your eyes and look around. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you need to change along with it. <br /> <br /> There are far more interesting and funny scenarios for which you can apply your brand of anguish and neuroticism - why not try them out? <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, he does not do anything to me - because now I expect his old wait: the couple who are getting tired of each other and end up cheating. Depressive and even old, even old. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to win his fans back, then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated - not insulted.
