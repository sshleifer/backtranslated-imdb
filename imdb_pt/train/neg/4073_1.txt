NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but this has to be the poorest attempt to make one. To call this a "movie" is also a stretch. This "random-of-obviously-fake-and-tacky-violence-and-a-ugly-woman-trying-act-sexy-edited-bad-together" clip is not worth watching. Watching this is just as interesting to watch as a family's random holiday photos, and it's about the same quality you would expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with his new video camera , and tell him to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
