Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you would never know that for this heavy mess. This film not only looks cheap, it's also cheap - most of the battle scenes are taken from the far superior "The Last Command" of 1955, and this film, filmed 32 years earlier, seems more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were filmed for this movie are disorganized, confusing and incompetent, looking as weak as the rest of the picture. This has the appearance of a bad student film (and the budget does not seem to be much more). He moves like molasses, acting mostly is over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose - although Raul Julia comes out better than most of the rest of the cast - and is replete with annoying historical inaccuracies. Besides, it's a long time. If you're going to make a boring movie, do it in an hour or so and get it over with - do not stretch it for more than three hours like this movie. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out the John Wayne version of 1960, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. Hard to believe that it took six producers to make such a bad movie. Skip this.
