Well, what I can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many Asian faces. What I did not like about the movie was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. The Asian girl, unreliable, has to play another person to make progress, the white guy in love with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind, to the land of yellow and to the taxi driver "keeping real." Also, all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit obvious too. The plot of the story itself was fun, but pretty much as I thought the story would unravel. Then again, when watching romantic comedies you can not expect much, but again I would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of the movie.
