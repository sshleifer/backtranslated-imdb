Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paulo Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon which we usually associate with extremely bloody horror films like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, we made a little detour here and made a little science fiction movie. I emphasize the word "little", since this is a very low budget film, and therein lies its main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. A world in which the great superpowers (which according to this film are the United States and Russia) defy their differences by not going to a full world war ... but fighting against gladiatorial battles with gigantic robots. Our hero Achilles must go against the poorly-bred Russian robot fighter Alexander. A lot of cheap animation in stop motion happens. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is incredible, I guess. The big nations resolving territorial disputes with giant robots? Interesting premise and one that could have been dealt with properly if the appropriate budget was available. Unfortunately, what could have been an entertaining film turns out to be an embarrassment for a great director. <br /> <br /> I, as a kid, loved this movie, and I think if you want some pleasure with this movie, We'll have to go back to kid mode to have fun with it. I showed this movie to some of my friends and how the movie progressed my friends, where as "what the heck is this piece of crap Frank?" And I'm kind of well, this movie is a science fiction from one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon? "But when the film progressed in tacky territory I almost felt like stopping and not letting them go through this torture.I could go through because I loved this movie as a child, and there is still a bit of nostalgia attached to watching it , but all the others simply would not understand it. <br /> <br /> And I realized that the movie is not like that. <br /> <br /> The movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other, and to achieve this in a believable way , you would have to use some very good special effects to make it work, expensive effects this would help us to suspend disbelief. But unfortunately this is a small-scale movie, from a small-scale company (Empire Pictures, which was bankruptcy after making this movie!) the effects only help us to laugh and laugh at them.sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half-finished. <br /> <br /> OK granted, once you accept that you're watching a mix of anim Moderate stop action and thumbs up well, you can kind of indulge in the movie and even take advantage of the big robots kicking each other's hell out. There are certain scenes in which robots are fighting that are cool, and made me go "that's why I liked the movie!" But every one knows and they, some low quality effect will get you out of that little protective cocoon you were trying to hide. And all of a sudden, you're back to realizing that this film simply does not fulfill the premise. <br /> <br /> And here's another thing that kind of bothered me a bit about the movie. This movie is basically a movie for kids. You know, giant robots are fighting? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this dialogue of films has had many sexual innuendoes and the violence gets a bit bloody. So I kept asking myself if this is a children's movie or not? After a while I only came to the conclusion that basically this was a movie of children with adult sensitivity, which really is not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who do not feel so certain naive childish charm of seeing two robots fighting each other and if you do not have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like me) well, I suggest you stay away from this movie. Gordons a great director, but this movie he did, just did not do it for me. Well, at least not now that I'm an adult. <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
