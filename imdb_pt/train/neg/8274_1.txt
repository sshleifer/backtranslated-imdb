Ahh this movie had so much potential! A good cast of quality B actors, the thighs of Jessica Simpson and ... that's about it! <br /> <br /> I believe a guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea. Basically, let's do some kind of Legally Blonde movie, but do it in New York. That big and bright city of chances, power and money and where everyone is a heartless, hungry power / money person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, small town bimbo, that brother of Owen Wilson and for some apparent reason not Andy Dick (just because of him you should ignore this movie). <br /> <br /> Basic storyline: <br /> <br /> The boy leaves the girl to NY, the girl follows, boy scams, girl stays in NY with cousin, gets a job under false pretenses, mucks up, is wooed by another boy (Brother Wilson) and together save the day and kiss. <br /> <br /> Some words come to mind when you reflect on this movie, that is, terrible, horrible, unbearable, intolerable and xenophobic <br /> <br /> Just do not watch this movie, you will be more happy. One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and I definitely agree with him. This film induces shock. And I know what you're thinking ... at least at some point I'm going to see Simpson naked or close too. It will not happen, save time and make YouTube of it. You will have a sexier time! <br /> <br /> Mounting the films is fragile, the acting is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens? In conclusion; this is a cinematographic betrayal that should be punished to the max <br /> <br /> Another question why Willie Nelson always plays a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson movie and why there is no black, Latin, Asian or European? people in this movie?
