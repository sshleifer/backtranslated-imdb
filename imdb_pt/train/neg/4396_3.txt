My complaints here concern the progress of the film and the material at hand. Although using films and archival letters lend the film a new and interesting perspective, often the material selected for highlighting is simply not very interesting (as when Goebbels complains about this or that illness, etc., or the filming ad nauseam of small town German Christmas). In addition, the movie crawls on cover c. 1920-1939 and then goes through the war years. In short, the film is a bit better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensitivity than the History Channel's documentary editor and therefore can organize the life of Goebbels. Still, I thought I wanted to.
