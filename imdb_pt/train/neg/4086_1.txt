I came in this movie with high expectations. I was aware of the work of Greenaway and 'The Tempest' and was interested in an adaptation. First I wanted to hang up after ten minutes, but I felt it would be unfair. There was a representation of a storm, but in your mind do you conceive a little boy peeing on a toy boat? Is it symbolic of what? I continued for another ten minutes, my finger squirming at the 'off' button, somewhere something that would capture my interest. This is not Shakespeare, it's not cinema. There is a time and place for this, but I will not waste my time and there is no place for it in my studies of Shakespeare. After twenty-five minutes I gave up and that was the end. So I read all the comments on this site and the pretense of the movie is just matched by its defendants. 'It's a painting ..... then put it in a gallery', 'it's a ballet ..... keep it on stage then'. Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and the plays were performed for mass audiences, they were accessible, and this version helps to put a barrier between Shakespeare and the general population - and I do not think the Bard would be happy about it.
