This is a really bad movie. But not as bad as reputation suggests. The production values ​​are not so bad and there is a strange and effective scene. And it has a 80's cheezid varnish that means it's always fun. Beware, too, with the brief appearance of Jimmy Nail - his American accent attempt is so astonishingly ridiculous that it's fantastic. Fantastic are also Sybil Danning's breasts - they make a brief appearance in the film, but the scene is repeated countless times in the final credits, which can only be described as the 12 "remix of Sybil Danning's breasts. It has to be seen to be believed.As a horror movie, it is not scary, the effects are silly and Christopher Lee dreams of his performance.I think he was buying a new house and needed some money for the deposit.The two central characters - the man and the woman - were so insignificant that I almost forgot everything about them and I watched this movie earlier tonight. The werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original film, actually bizarrely, sometimes they look more like with monkeys badly burned.The European environment is very good and the music of the new wave band Babel, although it is quite terrible, at least gives the film some cheese. It's not good quality, but you did it seriou cunning expected it to be? And at least you always received Sybil's saddlebags.
