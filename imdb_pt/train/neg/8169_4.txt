The film begins with a couple of campers, a man and a woman presumably together, walking alone in the vast desert. Surely the man hears something and torments him so much that he will investigate. Our killer greets him with a stab in the stomach. He then chases the girl and slits his throat. The camera during the opening scene is from the killer's point of view. <br /> <br /> Next, we find our four main characters, two couples, one in which is on the rocks. The men play about how the woman would never be able to camp alone on a double date, sparking the symbolic blonde's ambition to leave a week earlier. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car breaks down. They end up coming at night. When the men arrive, they are warned about people disappearing into the woods by a wacky Ralph doppleganger. They ignore the warning and venture into the dark night and a song from the eighties touches the background with lyrics about murder in the dark forest. The men get lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that this is not just another clone of The Burning, but a ghost story! The women, scared and lonely, are crowded by the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peek at Tom. Well, they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo! Her mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they see their children before they disappear, of course. <br /> <br /> The children run home and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river. This causes a lot of agitation and he gets up, picking up his knife from the fireplace. "Daddy is going to hunt," the girl exclaims with mischief. It is apparent here that the father is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> Crazed by something in the woods, the blond blonde splits, running blind in the night, carrying a knife. She finds the father who explains that he is starving and will be fast. This does not make sense because of the panther grunts we've heard before (maybe he's allergic! Panthers are honest even in California?) She ends up hurting him a little before being stabbed in the head. A storm erupts and men seek shelter, which is where Daddy lives. Clearly someone lives here because there is a fire and something strange is baking on it. The children come and tell them about Papa, who appears moments later. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our killer just goes after the females. He invites men to eat something and tells the story of his ex-wife. We got a flashback from his wife getting caught cheating. The old man does not tell them, however, that he kills her and her lover later, but dreams of it. We are not given the reason for the children's deaths. The men go to sleep and are left unharmed. The next morning, the men discover the empty encampment of their wives. After a brief discussion, they separated. One is staying at the camp, while the other goes and gets help. What is coming back to the car breaks the leg. We then join the children as they explain to the survivor that they are ghosts who have killed themselves because they are sad to their mother. They agree to help the woman reunite with her friends. <br /> <br /> The next scene defies the logic of the movie when Dad kills the guy who is waiting in the camp. He was also dating or married to the blonde. Somehow the children realize that he is murdered and tell the woman about it. She decides to see for herself and obviously runs to the killer. Luckily the kids make him stop threatening to leave him forever. You know where this is going. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie deserves four stars out of ten, and that's generous. In spite of all your doubts, the musical score is well made. It is still watchable as well. There are some camera angles that look professional, and some of the sets are well made. The plot is unbelievable. There is a voluntary suspension of disbelief, but with the frog 10 miles away; I can not imagine what the blonde token would pull off like this in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
