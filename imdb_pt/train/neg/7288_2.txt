NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. However it is not good. The scenes were drawn way, way, way, long time. The sex scenes were unnecessary and often too long. The movie edited for 2 hours and 10 minutes or more would have been exceptional, but unfortunately it has become so boringly long that I can only give it a value of 2 out of 10. It's far below average. <br /> <br /> Other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays the entire family tree. The guy who played the great-grandfather does not look anything like him, but the grandfather, the father and the son (who gives us an unnecessary and constant voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality . No one seems to notice that each of these children looks like a clone of the past, although pictures of them are being taken every turn. This is minor, but if the movie did not last 3 weeks, it would not have been so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no news from Germany was whispered any longer Jews being gathered and expelled is ridiculous. Some word would have come to them and the thought of trying to flee would probably have been discussed. The uncle in France would certainly have sent a warning to try to get them to leave. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this movie are totally wrong. You are spending forever telling us this and developing relationships between the main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost instantly ... married. Then have children. So we've been drawing things for six centuries and forgetting to develop relationships. This again would not have been much in a 2-hour movie, but with time spent nothing was given. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending was just plain bad. I do not want to ruin this for anyone, but you're not going to like it either ... unless you're a sadist. <br /> <br /> The director / writer must be tortured by having to watch this bloated junk on a weekly basis, I mean infinite cycle, oops they are the same thing. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this movie, I think Istvan Szabo must be modeling his directing career after him. Prolonged film that totally destroys any substance in the film. A brief description of 'The Horse Whisperer' and Sunshine. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, perfect title. If you start watching while the sun is shining, you'll probably be fine after dark when you leave.
