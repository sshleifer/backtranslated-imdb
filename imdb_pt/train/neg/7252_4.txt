DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newbies, but it does not have all the common flaws that plague most of these films. It has a definite history, it has adequate acting, the photography is very good, the hero and the villain are formidable men, and the background music is not exaggerated. This is a new version of the DVD, so people will search here to see if it's worth it. I do not know where all 10 come from, since there is no way this movie is so good - even if you are the filmmaker's mother. <br /> <br /> The last movie we saw in a theater was Warner's junk in JK Rawlings, much loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. When comparing DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as done by Warner) had no history, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photograph was terrible, and the authoritative soundtrack of the wall of sound was just a mess. I rated Phoenix as "1" because the scale does not decrease. The DECOY is 4 times better - in all respects. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, give The Decocus a try. Remember, this is not "Decoy 3 - the Shootout" or any such nonsense. Is original. If your expectations are not exaggerated with the foolish "10" results here, you can simply enjoy the movie on your own terms.
