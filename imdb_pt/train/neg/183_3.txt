This is Western action. James Steart leads a cast of stars in the scenic Northwest, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and the costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a rich rancher who comes into conflict with a corrupt government in old Nothwest. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the stereotypical skepticism that Hollywood has always turned into a hero. Even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotyped hero, and what Stewart really portrays has few saving grace. He is gentle with his two partners, and that gives him an extra dimension of credibility and sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, it is so obscene to everyone else, it is hard to really care about it, or accept it. It is very much like the western single-dimension spaghetti characters (not so bad). <br /> <br /> Still, the secondary characters are quite nice. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others are worth watching.
