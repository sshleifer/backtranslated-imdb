Apparently, most viewers do not know anything about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and all of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Age of Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many forgotten judgments throughout Europe) was a vengeance and an injustice of the victors. What do you think, why was there no American, British, French or Soviet defendant after World War II? There were no American, British, etc. war crimes. There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn, and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (This was also a book title in America, 1941.) <br /> <br /> This film is a horrible and ignoble American brainwashing instrument, full of mistakes, lies, propaganda, prejudice, and injustice. And first of all: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... Why was not the Nuremberg process itself enough? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred, narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very clever. Even Stalin would be envious of this ...
