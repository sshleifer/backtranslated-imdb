The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar owns the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It's hilarious Except for the typical comedy of Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I do not see anything positive about this movie. The story looks like the writer told his 10 year old son to write. The film is so unreal that Anil Kapoors shooting the long distance with a shotgun is the director's slightest mistake. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie, there is no other Tashan. I regret losing my money in this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give the IMDb or give a zero.
