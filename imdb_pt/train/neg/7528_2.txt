This is even worse than the original Game of Death. A cluttered and incoherent plot leads to "Billy Lo" falling from a helicopter on the ground below, killing him while we are left to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So not only did we start following some clone of Bruce Lee, the movie kills that movie and makes us follow another within thirty minutes of the story. The main reason to watch this is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, who is obviously a guy with a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually very good, but his time on the screen is significantly small. I mostly watched this and the original game of death because they are a part of Bruce Lee's box set. No wonder they are included in Lee's finished work. No one would buy them any other way.
