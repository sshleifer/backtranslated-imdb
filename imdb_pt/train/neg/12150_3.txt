Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies that will follow your hard-earned money. Suggestion? Save your hard-earned money and let's just say that the good old TheatreX took one to the team in this. Guess what the plots about? Taking over zombies. This time around, for the sake of originality (?), This movie takes place in Rhode Island and, to be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie movie in Rhode Island. A government-controlled TV station is reportedly holding "normal" broadcasts so that the remaining citizens do not think there is a problem in the world, that is, those who never look or leave anyway. I'll say though that some of the commercials broadcast this season were probably the most entertaining part of this movie. Actually, there's a bit of history for this, but I'm not bothering about it because after a while you will not care or have fallen asleep. Anyway, this has a lot of terrible action to play on top of all the "all before seen" stuff that is displayed before the camera. Trust me, you can find many other things to do with your time than watch this. 3 out of 10.
