We can start with the acting of wood, but this movie is a disaster. Having grown up in NY I can tell you that this movie is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people. I'm not even a culture advocate and I find this Hollywoodized junk to fit into your own presentation and fictional and ridiculous language that anyone who sees Seinfeld know is inaccurate. This is a colossal loss of time and, worse yet, not exactly interesting, since the result is obvious and the confronting scenes are laughably bad. Who acts this way? Nobody. <br /> <br /> The name of the writer sounds Israeli or something of that nature, but of course he has no idea about the subject he is writing about. Looking at his biography, it is shocking that he lived in New York and wondered how much of a real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre movies like "The Stranger Among Us" are better and closer to the truth than this movie. Reading the credits of this guy, it's no wonder that he's written scripts on all C-level movies that somehow feature stars. shocking. Maybe he knows someone because this script is below the expected for a bad Dolph Lundgren movie.
