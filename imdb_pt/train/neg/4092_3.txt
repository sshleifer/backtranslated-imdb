I like the Fulci movies, I really like it and not in a boring ironic way too, but I recognize that they seem hopelessly ineffective and confusing to many people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at epic fantasy. gender and really does not succeed. Structurally, it's like most of the Fulci movies you've seen. Some things happen, some things happen and occasionally one scene may be tangentially related to another. It really is like Conan without sets, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is hardly an actor too), no budget, stupid soldiers and a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> This was hard to pass and I could have lived without the inch of Vaseline blurred on the camera to give that musical video look of Hair Metal.
