Based on the personal experiences of the time of director John Singleton at the University of Southern California, comes Higher Learning. A film centered on racial politics that takes place in modern colleges. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters for whom the film bases its foundation around its history: Malik Williams, a downtrodden carefree athlete who is an African. American male. Kristin Conner, a soft white girl, and Remy, a white, unsophisticated white man. All three are overcome by the sudden reality that university life is not as good as advertised, since all three are disappointed to be unprepared (Malik), for being naive (Kristin) and unwanted (Remy). <BR> <BR> One good thing about the movie is that it shows that modern American colleges are just great schools. Colleges are not places to build character, develop potential or increase personal advancement, but are institutions used to bring together all kinds of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere. It is an experience that is usually built for the failure of most students. It would have been nice if the film had built a story about this farce rather than racial politics. <br /> <br /> But that did not happen and that's where the movies are undone. Singleton, it seems, had a very bad experience in Southern California. Through this movie, he lets it all out. No need to knock around the bush here. Singleton allows the heroes and villains of this piece to be easily seen. The black characters of the film are practically seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains except for Kristin who was raped by a white colleague. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points to them who allegedly raped her? The ease that black gang members have at the university as a group of skinheads finds themselves in a dark little dormitory plotting violence? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristin Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They seem to be the third choices for the roles they played in this film (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore should play Malik and Kristin, but they were not available). O'Shea Jackson, also known as Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King, were all annoying in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history teacher. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character, of the three main characters, has changed more in the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to take up the issue of race and inequality in American college life with this film. And he did very badly. It was like killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is much more complex than it looks and people are all the same and he should know that. Higher Education is proof that he did not understand it. Seeing the movie, then and now, would only confuse, disappoint, and infuriate the same audience with whom he wished to speak. Not to mention that I would not entertain them at all.
