As soon as I started to see posters and hear about this movie, I was immediately excited. The Matrix was amazing to see and I could not wait to see the second, especially after starting to see his trailers in other movies. However, when I saw it, I left the theater extremely disappointed, as did many other movie goers in the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie were as incredible as ever, there were simply few of them. In the first film, there were constant fights going on, but the second had a much more (and very unhappy) point of view. To sum up the plot, there was not much that was not expected. The machines were digging toward Zion with the intention of destroying it (this is not a spoiler, everyone saw it in the commercials). The dialogue in the movie was absolutely horrendous. Unless you are a psychologist, you probably will not understand more of what is said in the film and because of that you simply will not care. It has become a bit of a romantic movie with the showing of events taking place in the lives and in the relationship of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, however much he was in the first film, seemed to be all religious and preacher. Personally, I do not need to hear about it or pay to listen to it. The film was a big waste of my time, and I guess I can not watch the first one. The dialogue and the constant boring monologues of basically all the characters made me lose interest in the movie quickly, and the small amount of good fight scenes pushed me closer to the edge, and the end of the film pushed me. Which movie ends with "To Be Concluded"? How original these people are. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn the midnight oil to get to that one. In conclusion, the movie was bad and that's the end.
