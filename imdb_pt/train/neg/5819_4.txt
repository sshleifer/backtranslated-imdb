This is a story of a dysfunctional Jewish family. The parents are divorced and the mother is in the east of the house. His father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children to California, and moves around Beverly Hills so his children can have the best education possible. <br /> <br /> Things really look funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece. lives with the group. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter is a woman who wants Murray to live with her since she wants a mate. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno arrive at the end. They play Murray's brother and sister-in-law respectively; They are also Tomei's parents. In front of the children, Reiner looses reminding Murray that he has paid the bills for them all the time. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a bitter note as the embarrassed family leaves their digs and takes to walk around Beverly Hills in their car. I think the film is promoting independence and good old self-esteem.
