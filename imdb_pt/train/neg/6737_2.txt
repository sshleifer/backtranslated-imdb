If Deborah Messing was not already cast as "Grace," this could be a tolerable movie. However, it is simply another tale of a troubled spinster who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) who reads in an article in Time magazine to travel to London for her sister's wedding in London. How new is this plot? <br /> <br /> Not funny, not even remotely romantic, the wedding date slips over the plot of the sex deceived by the bride and godfather, and paid for escorts to pass the movie as four weddings without Hugh, and definitely a business no way out for the naive groom who is ignorant of the sexual history of his fiancee (Amy Adams). While Messing has perfected the repressed princess, a 30-something woman with a failed relationship story, her neurotic and drunken movements in yet another fake boyfriend is simply updating her TV series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that does not redo what is already prime time. <br /> <br /> Many drunken female leads, visual cricket jokes and Mulroney in a towel (cool!), but the movie is a boring one with the obvious happy ending. Expected Messers Sequela: Date of Divorce.
