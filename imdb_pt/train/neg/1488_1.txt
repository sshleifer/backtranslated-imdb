I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment about how horrible this movie is ... my cats and a string ball have a better story than that. It's not the worst acting I've ever seen, but when you end up with almost the entire cast of the movie in 5 minutes, that leaves a bit to be desired. There was not a single 'scare' moment in the movie, except when they were watching the movie 'Halloween' on TV. All around, it looks like it might have been a good story, rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss, as I did not immediately recognize her and her scene was over before I could say 'oh yeah, there she is'. I am so glad that I saw this in a hotel and did not pay for it, as I would be really ticked off if I had paid a penny to see it. I usually like or can at least find a ransom factor in a movie, but this is an exception. It's so bad it's not even that much fun-good-it-bad .... it's just bad.
