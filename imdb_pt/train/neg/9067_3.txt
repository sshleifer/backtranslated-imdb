Although I have some hopes for this film, particularly because I like Jason Segel's performance (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared), I must say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in recent memory (Loser and Dr T and women too are on this list. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were a few moments of laughter, although the film might have been a lot better. <br /> <br /> The premise was not that ill-reckoned artists who cheat on college found the match when they (Jason Schwartzman) was a psychopath so big that it was not funny to see him in the first place, it was not disturbed in a particularly funny or charming way, he was just a wacky loser, which was actually quite dangerous and not fun to watch. cil to follow - kept cutting between fantasy and reality and often was not clear which was which. Only two or three of the gang scams were actually shown, you just had to believe that they were in fact scammers - showing that your plans would have made a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact, it was silly and poorly written and directed everywhere. I could talk about the flaws in the movie, but you get it. Not worth the $ 4 rent or the gas it takes to come and go from the rental property to rent!
