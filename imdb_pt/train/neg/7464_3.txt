I did not watch the whole movie. I could not watch the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I suggest that someone think about stopping before getting the disc out of the case. <br /> <br /> I like both tragic and comic mafia films, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt by a mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano simply tries a lot for the audience to laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely exaggerated and lacks subtlety or credulity - all of his strange mannerisms appear as planned - Chris Kattan is clearly 'acting' instead of taking a role - this gets you straight out of the story. Each scene is totally predictable, the "comic event" that will occur on set is obvious as each scene is presented. In comedies like Mr. Bean, the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you may have empathy with the characters' motivations and the initial event and situation where the character ends is not telegraphed. Corky, however, gives the impression that he is deliberately spoiling in a desperate attempt to get a laugh out of the audience. If Chris had not played an alien character (which never connects with the other characters in the movie) and whose behavior is totally unexplainable (except for trying to draw laughs) and the comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotyped - all jokes seemed too familiar - this movie could have been watched. But it is not. Do not watch.
