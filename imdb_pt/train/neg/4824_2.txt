I wanted to like this movie, but a lot of elements ruined it. The use of a fisheye lens everywhere and unstable editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of methamphetamine but it made me think that I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The film never seemed to go anywhere and the acting was really a great example of overdone acting. I love movies that give us a glimpse of the decadent underworld, but this movie could not decide whether it was a bad horror movie or a seriously serious commentary about the horrors of addiction.
