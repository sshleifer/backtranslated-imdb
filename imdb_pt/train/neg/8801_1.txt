Pieced together from dead body parts (Anchorman), Frankenstein's monster (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes (something you would never want to watch twice ... .. maybe even once for that matter.) More often than not the relativity of the scenes in WURB are made relevant by a third person narrator. Even more disturbing is that the characters in WURB are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (in the opening narration we are told WURB occurs shortly after the original.) At the end of Anchorman, Burgundy had grown from the beginning of the film and embraced having a co-anchor / hybrid lover. In this film, he is back to his immature banter with phone calls to Veronica (very clearly these are the same scenes of the original Anchorman inserted in the WURB). <br /> <br /> The part that makes this a movie, a constantly evolving story, involves a clan that steals money without a cause called the Alarm Clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit on. This part has been dismantled from Anchorman's original scripts. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes involving our Channel 4 news crew are clearly alternated / deleted in scenes from Anchorman. They go to the same party as in the original, the same original scene of "group complaining about having a woman on the team", and the same segment of fashion shows that Veronica had objections to report. <br /> <br /> Burgundy recreates its first encounter with the drive-in overlooking San Diego and dine at its favorite club, Tinos. No character mentions that he was in the drive-in before and when Burgundy enters Tinos with Veronica, he introduces her as if they had never been before. Oh, and they're wearing the same clothes as on the original date. <br /> <br /> Still, I have to give some credit to the filmmakers - even though WURB is nothing more than a clever way to present deleted scenes. tied together with narration. Between the two stories of Ron Burgundy - this is the weakest. Looking back, it is a great feat for Anchorman to have risen from the ashes of WURB. You look elegant, IMDb. Thank you for showing up.
