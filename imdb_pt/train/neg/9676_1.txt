The movies put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done it twice, so I took three sessions to finish it. The dialogue was bad. The women spoke with expression and the men were caricatures. And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese, had Chinese names, and clearly spoke Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why Emmenthal's men were sexually involved with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a hard choice: Do I give this movie a rating of one? or two? <br /> <br /> The movies put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done it twice, so I took three sessions to finish it.
