Some children walk through the mountains, and one of them enters a large tunnel and discovers an old mummified gladiator. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is so completely meaningless that it's maddening. Here is a short list of things that do not make sense: 1) A guy and a girl are in the tent and think they hear something from outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears the girlfriend scream, then they go back to the tent - arriving the next morning? It was only 15 feet away! <br /> <br /> 2) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream (100 yards away?), but do not investigate because they are afraid of getting lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and in their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances, the protocol no longer requires him to address her as a teacher . I mean, what ... First of all, this is just a really stupid thing to say, secondly he never called her teacher in the first nine scenes they were together. <br /> <br /> 4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him to injure without killing. Um, yeah, we realize she's hurt and she's not dead because she's awake and walking around. But, thanks for that bit of information. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is tied in the den of Demonicus, and when someone tries to free her, she instructs that person to seek help. Um, look, idiot, if she frees you, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need for help. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on. The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the forest, so they fight, so they throw a tent and ignore the screams of their friends, so they wander a little more. It's so boring and meaningless that I opened the DVD halfway. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are nice, especially the ones that get most of the time on screen. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a child in a Halloween costume, frowning to look bad. He runs, or I should say scampers around as he is gay. The special effects are comical, the acting is for the most part horrible, and nothing makes sense. Overall, maybe this concept could have produced a fun movie if they put in more time and effort getting rid of ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with really nice personalities, having some kind of logical flow to the action , and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator costume. But no, instead, we have that absurd stack of nonsense that bores you to death.
