Madhur gave us a powerful Chandni Bar movie in the past. His next film was one of the worst movies of all time. Apparently, it tells the story of some high-class people in India. After seeing a scene in which the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidentally I did. The reason the film contains scenes of child pornography and sexual abuse. I literally threw up and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing things, there was no need to show the children completely naked. One of the wealthy guys likes to kidnap poor kids and sell them to foreign people, British men in this movie. I am shocked to learn that this movie was a hit in some parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I'm from the UK, and that sort of thing makes me sick, it should not have been released in the UK.
