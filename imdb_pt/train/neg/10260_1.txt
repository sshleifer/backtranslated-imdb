This movie was terrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I watched the first 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb. The acting was bad and there was no plot. The monster is so fake. also does not move. Also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster. Very well, neither waste your time (1 out of 10)
