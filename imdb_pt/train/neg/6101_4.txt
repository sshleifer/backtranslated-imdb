Almost one piece for two people and, as such, the dialogue and the actions of the leaderships will be important. None of them is particularly good. This could have been stronger, in fact, if it had been initially worked as a piece for two people, and then worked on a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a nervous vampire who looks a bit autistic falls in love with a stripper (as a result of watching too much pornography in his low quality home). He wants her to tell you about the light of day. It would have been better to find someone with a daily job, or someone who stands out in painting an image with words like a poet, but then they may not have a warm body. <br /> <br /> After he makes her do whatever he wants (and he's not very good at it), he plans to feed her at 6 in the morning when the sun rises. Much is made of that deadline, despite the fact that he also says that he can go without food, this will only make him more hungry. In addition, he claims he can not let the stripper go as long as she knows about him, but he lets a number of other people go to know who he is. There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Why does this vampire choose to live in such a poorly enclosed house that the light from the light poles and neighboring buildings comes in as if it were daytime, I'm not sure. With all the time in the world, you would think he would have done a better job, or fixed the place up a bit. He is clearly not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> This is supposedly a remake, and I'm curious to see the original version of it, Dance of the Damned. Although, this was directed by Katt Shea, and the other films she directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were very bad.
