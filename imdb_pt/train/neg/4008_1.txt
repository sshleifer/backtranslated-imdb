As a fan of Sookie Stackhouse's books, I think this series is a grossly crude representation of them. The Vampire Bill is not very handsome and looks much older than the one described in the book. I have found that they have already made wonderfully colorful characters look very rational and vulgar. One of the things I loved about the books is that despite all the crap she's going through Sookie is always a lady, and still in the TV series she does not look like any of that. Not only that, but the biases exhibited in the TV series are not so widespread in books. I did not expect an exact replica of the books, but at least I expected their feeling to be used for the series.
