I read Tom Robbins' book Even Hand Gets The Blues as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny and full of glamorous landscapes and beautiful writings. But when I saw the movie, I could not believe it was a piece of boring, sour junk and no joy. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it in "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". Now, anyone over the age of 12 who reads the book will know they DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING to do with real lesbians, just like STAR WARS is not about real space travel. The book was obviously - and I mean OBVIOUSLY - written by a heterosexual man who loves the IDEA of lesbians (naked, all the time), but never actually met one. <br /> <br /> Still, someone in Hollywood said, "Oh, you better give this to a gay director or gay people are going to cause trouble." Then they delivered it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but - as gay as he may be - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant had a playful fantasy of guilt-free girl / girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a bumbling lesbian power recruitment poster. It's like turning a comedy from Oscar Wilde into a tragedy of Arthur Miller. It's not pretty. <br /> <br /> The main sign that Gus Van Sant had no idea what to do with the source material is the ill-intentioned cast. His influence allowed him to hire the best. His ignorance of the real subtext of romance (the fantasy of a straight man, not a gay pride recruiting poster) made him make choices that were not only bad but bizarre. <br /> <br /> Let's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET The Blues. PAT MORITA as "THE CHINK" Ok, there are few Asian name recognition actors. And Pat Morita, on HAPPY DAYS, was pretty funny. But cast it as the CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did not tell him.) Pat also does not seem to know that Chink is. . . well, SEXY !!! In the book, he is not the wise Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He is an old goat and knows a lot about how to please Sache and Bonanza Jellybean. (You see, in the book, they're NOT REALLY lesbian. Do you realize that this is the fantasy of a straight man still?) JOHN HURT as "THE CONDITION". Okay, he's a gay friendly man. But he's a SERIOUS ACTOR, SHAKESPEAREAN !!!! You need someone who is fun and a camper for that role. For John Hurt to be cast as a silly face as the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept expecting Paul Scofield to be dressed all as Thomas More, and sadly I shook my head. "Now, Richard, you know you've lost your soul completely. For shame, my ex-student!" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and very gay) like Caligula. But this was the dark humor, not the cheerful and cheerful humor like the book. <br /> <br /> CHEVE FIX as "Bonanza Jellybean". No talent, no training, no problems. Only in the book Bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the film she is taciturn, passive, without expression and without grace. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it that way. "God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man who fits." Gus? Did you read this book? <br /> <br /> A THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw". This is a difficult role. In the book, Sissy is really an exceptionally passive and timid heroine. Still, a more talented actress could have produced a sparkle in her eyes, or a swing in her walk, to suggest some sort of occult strength or hidden pleasure from her adventures. One can not, probably because Gus never told her that Sissy should enjoy being a wanderer with a handsome body and giant thumbs. One interprets more as if it were in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This movie is sour and bland. And I accuse you, Gus Van Sant!
