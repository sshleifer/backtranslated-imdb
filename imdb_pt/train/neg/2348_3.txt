Ashley Judd in an early role and I think her first leading role shows her rebellious nature of real life in this slow feminist novel. Wow, is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? Being a convinced feminist in real life, she must have enjoyed this script. No wonder the left-wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; is well in its political alley as well. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the critics here, I'm glad Judd rises from this stupid idiot to better roles in entertaining films, and did not preach the heavy liberal agenda.
