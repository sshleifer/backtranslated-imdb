'Major Payne' is a movie about a major who makes life hell for his small group of boys in the Marines. This movie does not have much to offer, but offers several hilarious moments that are worth watching. Do not expect it to be a memorable movie, though. Just expect to laugh your way through the movie and at the expense of other people. The clash between Major Payne and the chubby kid was hilarious, and that's all I remember about the movie except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a great movie, and it's probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughs.
