I've never been impressed with JD anyway, and Final Justice (which I had not seen before showing MST3k) is no exception. Not that the character is less sympathetic than Mitchell: it's just that there is less than Geronimo ("Call Me Heronimo") to dislike. <br /> <br /> In fact, Mitchell and the Final Court are suspected of all scheming for an agent seeking Joe's revenge for trying to get the "star" dead for inducing a heart attack. Joe Don must have found a new agent as he is now graduated to "comic relief." The problem is that it's hard to tell the difference between your comedy characters and your "serious" characters in your action movies like that. <br /> <br /> As for the plot ... They repeat the same pieces so repeatedly that you think you were watching Groundhog Day 2. Presumably, the fact that they continue to use the same Geronimo scene coming out of prison is supposed to be a comic relief of some sort. Ummm, yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the scenery of Malta is very beautiful, so this gave me a 2 for me. lick set Malta tourism back a couple of decades, however.
