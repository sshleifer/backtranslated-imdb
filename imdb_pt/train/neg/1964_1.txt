When I saw the movie cover, the first thing I thought was that it was made for video. The second thing that came to my mind was the resemblance to the other terrible movie "Darkness Falls", the story of this idiot witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was a masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage, and this film should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a little story for the witch, or, more like a useless introduction of two little children who will find the tooth fairy in the hope that it will give them a shiny new bike for their teeth . The opening is badly filmed, and like the rest of the film, it certainly is not scary. At present, the film is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter is renting his house, and his ex-girlfriend, Darcy (Chandra West), and her daughter Cole come to stay there. Cole knows a child from the neighborhood, and they talk about the Tooth Fairy, and how you should not lose the tooth, or she will come after you. Unfortunately, seconds later, it seems that the Tooth Fairy steals your bike and beats the tooth (which is ironic). Will Cole will survive the wrath of the Tooth Fairy, and will his mother and Peter be able to save her, and rekindle their romance? This is a bad movie, you could probably figure it out. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this stupid movie is how indefinite the tooth fairy is. They say it kills you if you lose your tooth, but no. She is more like a serial killer who kills randomly, and if you lose your tooth, you will definitely go away. She steals a bike, so apparently she's a thief too. I said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the appearance of Tooth Fairy? We will see. She looks like a burn victim, and she previously went around the neighborhood killing kids. Hmmm ... it's almost like she's an exact copy of Freddy Krueger from the movies "Nightmare on Elm Street." And this is not the worst part of this terrible mess, the climax is. This movie may have the most laughable climax (not literally laughable because I found it more sickly than funny) that I have ever seen. I do not see that. <br /> <br /> Just a little trivia. Lochlyn Munroe was in the Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and both were in it, so apparently the horror movie stars are forced to end their career with bad horror films. <br /> <br />: 1/2 out of **** 80 min. R for violence.
