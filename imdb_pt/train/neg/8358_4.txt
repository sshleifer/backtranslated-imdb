This is not one of the best Arbuckle or Keaton movies, for sure. Fatty's wife is tired of all her drinking, so she takes him to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed cure! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to surgery. Then he escapes and is chased over the place where he meets a beautiful girl who also wants to escape. Finally, despite the team chasing them, they escape and then it becomes apparent that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon recaptured. However, he wakes up and everything after surgery has been a dream - there was no sexy crazy girl and Dr. Keaton is not as incompetent as he looked in the dream. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is the biggest problem with the movie. Of course, making fun of the mentally ill is very low, but in your day was guaranteed laughs. I would also laugh if there was something funny to answer! Lots of energy and that's all. FYI - During one of the pursuit sequences, Fatty wonders about a race for men over 200 pounds (wow, what are the chances of that?). And right after that, he goes back to a post in which the number 5 was freshly painted. As a result, the five are now on the back of Fatty's shirt and he looks like a regular contender. However, the number must have appeared back in Fatty's shirt, but came out ahead - a mistake, as they should have realized that the image in the mirror would have been a setback 5.
