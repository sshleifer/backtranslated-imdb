I'll say it - this director is all about RAW images ... things that most of us are not ready to confront head on. Images of sex, suicide, murder and "relieving" people are constantly bombarding the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. Although I do not think I can see this movie again, I'll say the director has a good eye. There were some really cool scenes and "snapshots" in the movie (the fans, the wire hairs in the hair), but the story left me needing more (strictly since we kept asking ourselves "what the hell did we do?" only? "). Note: If you have a tendency to vomit or vomit easily ... do not watch this movie.
