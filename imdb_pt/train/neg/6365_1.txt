Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Footer Roddy Piper is a sickly retired cop (cliché!), Helping everyone - smiling like a postoperative lobotomy patient all the time and whining about his dead son. His adopted son returns from the Special Ops Armed Forces and because he "saw things" - pictured for clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. Time to clean up the streets of another guy who once met Piper and her dead son (who the bad boy killed) and his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, love interest is a beautiful young woman who decides there's no reason for her to want to skip the bones of the former Army guy. This happens in about 2 minutes of a scene. <br /> <br /> The action could have saved this movie, but it's even worse than plot and acting. Everything was done before, everything was done much better (Ong-Bak is a great example). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the film is called HONOR (written wrong for Americans) and the slogan has "Bloodsport's and Kickboxer's Creators" - check out the other films of director David Worth and you'll soon realize why they put these two films there, despite being over 10 years old. Such classics as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - it really says it all. <br /> <br /> I'll give you £ 10 if you do not go see this movie. PS - Apologize for not knowing the names of the characters, say something.
