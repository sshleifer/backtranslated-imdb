I watched this .... let me rephrase ... I suffered from it because I'm Eva's fan. I do not think this is a movie that she's going to put on the back of her pictures in the head. I like gangsta flix, but that was not even close. The budget could not have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably spent with the vendor. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you had the chance to worry. her or not. <br /> <br /> I will not mind telling you who did what and how, because it's not worth the effort. I'm just glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local rental store, I did not have to pay for that garbage. <br /> <br /> OH !! Before you fall in love with me, I love movies, I found that many flips were good that some of you played, so for me to improvise it tells you everything you need to know.
