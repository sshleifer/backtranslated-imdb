Let me put it another way: balls. Or that such a bun * ks. This is really awful, more embarrassing than those who try to satirize. Julia Roberts is a skilled actress and her work is generally of the highest standard. This film is so lacking in direction that it even strives to look proficient. Usually she is a consummate professional, but I swear that in her eyes there were signs of perplexity and despair. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have rescued this movement was the director's idea (Chris Walken). transforming the film into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, this theme has not been exploited to its full potential. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal was to continue acting. Buffy's two talented former stars have had different experiences - Green hopelessly badly shaped and Balfour underused. Well done to Julia for practically preventing this from being the worst movie ever made.
