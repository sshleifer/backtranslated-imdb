What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a policeman who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and holds them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and the size of the jar he's already taken about fifty times) and a secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who, for some reason, direct him to Mexico. If they were intentionally sent there or if they were really lost, it is never clear. And you'll never hear another script, the word "butthorn" either. Gary Busey experiences the role of Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is an actor who serves, the script condemns the whole movie to mediocrity. William Smith takes another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in "Red Dawn" a few years earlier. After playing the bikers for most of the '70s, it was kind of fun to see him expand his reach by playing heavy-duty communists. Unfortunately, he will probably always be remembered as the guy Clint Eastwood did in "Every Which Way You Can".
