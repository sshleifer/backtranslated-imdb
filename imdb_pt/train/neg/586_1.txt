After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River, WHY was replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It simply was not the same without Spur and Harrison, as portrayed by Douglas. Maybe he recognized how poor the plot was - Jim returns after a long absence, to find Jessica being chased by another man. He could not expect a girl to wait so long without contact, and find no contest. For a Disney movie, this contains foul language, in addition to the highly unnecessary part when Jim and Jessica got married without getting married - very LAME. Very an insult to the intelligence of the viewer, according to members of my family. I'll stick with the first one and try to forget I've seen the sequel!
