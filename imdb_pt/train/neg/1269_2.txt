This series earns 2 stars just because it puts some of Dickens Bleak House in the movie and maybe someone else reads the book. Contrary to what is probably the opinion received, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock. She was awkward and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character, but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. So I'm going to interrupt and respond to all the people who are saying, "I did not read the book, so I do not have to accept the opinion of this guy because he's basing his assessments on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is poor in her role because of bad acting, whether or not you have read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passable (though very old) Jarndyce. The series fails not because it is unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various story lines and characters just do not come together to create a coherent, dramatic, mysterious, and compelling entertainment. It's boring and flat. If you want to make a good Bleak House, you need to spend 20 hours of film in 10 two-hour episodes. But I suggest that producers, etc., leave Dickens alone (even A Christmas Carol). Television cushions the genius of Dickens, manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters.
