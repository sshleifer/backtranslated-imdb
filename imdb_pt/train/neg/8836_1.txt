This is not art, it's urban propaganda, politically correct! Jindabyne's political intolerance is beyond unforgivable ... does not see people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. <br /> <br /> This is the most patronizingly offensive Australian movie I've ever remembered (and it's up against some pretty tough competition!). A message film, every tired and beloved theme of fashion is there: Aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholic; white women are not that bad - especially if they are lesbians - but they are more susceptible to a depressive nature. <br /> <br /> Four men go fishing, find the body of a murdered woman (aboriginal, of course) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch the trout. It is a strange decision made almost without discussion, as if men were animals. The only man who for a moment disdains is goodie ... we know this because he is living with a bisexual woman - he is very fond of holding the baby - and eventually moves to a more elegant costal location (away from all these This is a film made by those fashionable urbanites who live in fear of the Australian landscape and the perverse peasants who live in the countryside.The ignorance of country life is almost as shocking as its contempt. a long-distance course of the bush supported by a mysterious foreboding song.It is very clear in the end that the Aborigines are the only ones at home in this landscape.It concludes with a relentlessly relentless scene of black-white reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne , life in the countryside is reduced to little more than a backdrop to a story that, by implication, proclaims the superiority of the values ​​of the enlightened urban left. <br /> <br /> This film was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the government's Film Finance Corporation. It is a product of the art scene, which has no soul populated by the beautiful people for whom government funding sustains these offensive projects (which are as far from real life as possible), as opposed to making popular movies that people want to see. It does not matter if the movie is bad, they are still paid. <br /> <br /> Spare yourself from wasting time, avoid it like the plague. Social comment more tired than real entertainment, this movie deserves bread!
