An innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) has a night with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). She sees a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) being attacked from the outside, but she can not call the police because it would ruin her marriage to Gutenberg's boss (Paul Shenar). So Guttenberg, honest citizen he is, when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed only half an hour later, introduces himself and claims to have witnessed the first attack, only intending to pass the information given to him by Huppert. Well, never give false testimony against your neighbor, as they say. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police catch a killer quickly becomes distorted. When he finds the first near-victim, McGovern, she immediately writes down what happened, but agrees to be quiet for now. But then Guttenberg is in court, supposedly to identify the heavy (Greenquist) and we find through the interrogation that he is DISTURBED and can not identify objects from a distance, much less faces. (Not that it matters because, after all, he's never seen fluency in the first place.) The plot gets virtually labyrinthine. Guttenberg ends up being the prime suspect when Huppert is murdered as well. <br /> <br /> He barely escapes from prison and sticks with the now friendly McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern create a plan to arrest the killer. It will serve as bait. They will follow the flag creep into one of their haunting thugs and McGovern will act as the doxy the killer is drawn to, just to make him try to kill her. But all will be well, see, because not only will Guttenberg keep an eye on her, and not only will she alert the police a few minutes after she gets into that dive, but she'll keep a can of handy - just in case. <br /> <br /> I ask you, the alert viewer, does this scenario unfold as planned? Elizabeth McGovern has an oddly interesting bony structure. She looks like every jaw and little mouth sometimes, but she's vibrant. Steve Guttenberg has hair on his strength and that's about it. Otherwise, he is as impotent as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert can act, it is not evident in this film. The killer is so fashioned and so neat that it looks like he's wearing one of those deformity masks in the Twilight Zone episode about greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Has director, Curtis Hanson, not done the same? "Confidential LA"? That was a job well done. Everything here looks awkward and planned, even small parts. Just before the inevitable violent climax, a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay McGovern's rescue, and the scene is embarrassing to watch. Dick Olsen has a small part as a late buyer. He is a cool guy and always reliable. Paul Shenar as the betrayed husband has a striking face that looks made for the stage and he does a good job too. <br /> <br /> In that place where McGovern attracts the attention of the killer, where she plays pool with a couple of hairy monkeys, was shot in a bar in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, not far from where I lived The way the interior is set up, of course this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive. In fact, it looks more elegant on the screen than in reality. <br /> <br /> In general, this is Hitchcock's territory and brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story.
