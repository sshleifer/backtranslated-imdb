Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and enter into horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground," is an abysmal piece of trash. Now, I had noticed his name in association with this particular movie. I would have put it back, but no, I did not have my glasses and therefore I missed it, damn, I really need to bring those with me while the video purchases. The first question would be, who the heck is the target audience for that? It's almost like a "scary" children's movie, but then again there are topless girls and some gags and some profanity spouts here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see somebody, anyone, go after them with some kind of agricultural implements. It seems like a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a killer witch of children who has collected the teeth of the children lived there. Probably something that the real estate agent did not mention. Of course now, in modern days, there are little girl ghosts to warn the real little girl who lives there and that something bad will happen. There are, and there are also two Bubbas who were squatting on that property when the new owner took over, so they also took their revenge. This whole thing has the feel of some trash made for cable that is for kids on Halloween except, of course, things that are not suitable for small children, so not only is this mediocre, it is confusing as well. A big boo and whistle for Anchor Bay for putting that too, considering your usual track record with well releases this is a new low. The UK receives a Phantasm Box Set, we receive "The Tooth Fairy". It hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute rubbish.
