At Comic, modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks more like an anorexic model. She has neither the moral nor the personality that Modesty has in the comics. Modesty would never give a woman advice to show more skin to make more money. I can not see similarities with my comics with Modesty and this movie. It's like an Impossible Mission movie that would be about Ethan Hunt locked up in the high school detention room talking to the caretaker about when he went to high school and that Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). Soo if you are a fan of modesty do not see the movie you will only be angry. If you do not know much about the comics of Modesty, rent another movie and do not have time with this one. I can not understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on him. I'll ask for a refund at my DVD rental store tomorrow.
