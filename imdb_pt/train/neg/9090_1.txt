A propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will need to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semitic (or simply an anti-Zionist - nothing wrong in upholding the destruction of a country, right?) Or without criticism in support of Palestinian objectives (eg mass murder, destruction of Israel) , is the documentary for you. Must do for a fun evening on college campuses across the UK and USA. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged by the large number of lies presented in this video. I just hope that those who are not really aware of the situation are not corrupted by this anti-Semitic dirt.
