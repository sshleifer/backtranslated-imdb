I just saw it yesterday at the SÃ£o Paulo International Film Festival. Shortly before going I came here to see how it was evaluated, and at that time it was 7.4, a very cool rate ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes I was dying to leave (I never did it ), but I felt ashamed to do so as the producer of the film was in the screening. <br /> <br /> I did not like it at all, the dialogues are superficial and lead nowhere, the characters are shallower than the dialogues, nothing to get anywhere, and worse and worse: a lot of publicity from Siemens and Organics in the movie. Despite the fact that I have already paid to go to the movies and entertain myself, I still have to be bombarded by the main character talking on the internet and the Siemens cell phone showing up all the time on his laptop; or other character bathing or cutting hair just to have the Organics shampoo displayed on the screen! All this would be bearable if the plot, characters, novels, anything was good, but it was bad, very bad! A "I do not know how to do" sex in the city. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money.
