It's hard to find any good points in this movie. It seems the producer needed to make a buck without much effort and so we're treated to a full display of the Galaxy, which is the most ridiculous excuse for a movie in history. The cops looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More scenes of action from the two police and much less from the Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course this would increase the budget, so they decided to fill the space with that unfortunate reprise. Ms Albright makes excellent looking sexy and her acting is first rate. Stabs, whom I had heard of but had not seen on the screen before, also seemed very desirable but did not seem to have the basic acting talent. Besides Ms Albright, this is real rubbish.
