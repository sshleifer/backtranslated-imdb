The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy films. They have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is they never had the money to get compelling special effects. This film, released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures, from giant octopus to giant lobster, trying to dominate humans. It is extremely clumsy and laughable, but very nice too. After all, we like these creatures and these movies after all, do not we?
