As many others have stated, this is a terrible movie from every aspect of cinema. As they have already received some names from known actors to take on this project is incredible. <br /> <br /> Many people complained that they were filmed on 'cheap' video cameras. Yes, it was shot on video, but not on "cheap" video. What hurt her was lighting, white balance, shooting technique and editing. <br /> <br /> There were so many different techniques of filming and editing used that it was a production mess. Harsh, inconsistent lighting, on the use of hand-drawn (Woody Allen wing), shaken editing (another Allen technique), but poorly done, no real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant's kitchen scenes is embarrassing; very amateurs. <br /> <br /> The simulated sex scenes had no value in action at any level. <br /> <br /> How this video came to be printed is beyond me. Worth watching just to be amazed at how bad it is.
