ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth film in the series and shows the direction in which it was inevitably directed. Characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were in front and center. The rest of the cast was also going to just punch the clock and collect their checks. The show would return to the occasion again and have its moments, but a fatal decline settled. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue to portray the character JUDGE HARDY in a nice way. The rest of the cast would be professional, although it has less and less to do. Mickey Rooney, on the other hand, would continue his character as if there was no learning curve. Andy's reaction to any situation was naive and unbelievable. Even after returning as a World War II service veteran in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946), his reaction to any "teapot storm" was the same, youthful. <br /> <br /> In this film, it is clearly illustrated. . ANDY enters into several unbelievable situations that, with a simple explanation, would have been resolved. This on-screen writing device was known as "idiot plot." A means of lengthening a poorly written scenario. Maybe it was less of Mickey Rooney's fault than the Director and the Writers. More likely, George B. Seitz has driven too much and a firmer hand was needed to excessively control the excesses of Rooneys. To see our overview of the entire series, go to YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE (1937).
