I started watching this movie waiting for someone who was just tolerant of the horror movie Hammer ... and I was not too far away. There is a considerable amount of glory glimpsed, and they cast a lot of nudity, but the second half of the movie features some ironic twists. Sacred cow, they really put a little thought into the story and did not completely fall into the predictable things we were expecting at first. And I dare say, some of the "free" nudity was not so gratuitous, after all, because it fit the story and the setting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, it's still a bad movie, but as bad movies go, it's a smarter shadow than the horrible gut like Lost Women's Tablet and Robot Monster.
