Kurosawa really messed it all up. Every genie is allowed a failure. The concept is good, but the execution is badly erased. <br /> <br /> There is an air of fantasy about this film, becoming a kind of art film. The poverty of Tokyo deserves a fairer and more realistic portrait. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing movie.
