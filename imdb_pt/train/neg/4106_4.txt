It was almost unfathomable to me that this movie would be a failure, but I was really disappointed. Having been a connoisseur of Pekinpah cinema for years, I found this drastically reduced DVD for sale and thought it was worth a shot. The few initial credits, iconic for Pekinpah fans, have the inter-cut between man and animal, but here we have a non-diegetic environmental noise of kids playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted. Fantastic thrill. So when the criminals, Caan and Duval, travel to their next mission, Duval overthrows the bomb in Cann that their meeting last night had an STD, found only by snooping around his purse while Cann was being intimate with her. The laughter that follows is fantastic, and is clearly honored in Brian Depalma's Dressed to Kill, at the expense of Angle Dickenson. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits, the movie fails. Even Bring Me The Head, by Alfredo Garcia, has a stronger production value, a daring appeal to anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah credits as supplemental lecture material, but as soon as they're done, turn off the Killer Elite.
