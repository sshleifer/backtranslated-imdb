I was so excited and excited to watch this movie when the first promos were released in November! It looked amazing and the songs! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch! This is a movie that weaves 6 couples together. It has a multi cast of 12 people! A huge amount of stars worked on this movie. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, did not manage the situation well and should not have had many people in this film as this would make it easier for him. Compared to the debut in Nikhil's direction, "Kal Ho Naa Ho", "Salaam-e-Ishq" is well behind. I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast. I think the best factors in this movie are the songs! The songs are great and I think all the songs are amazing, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did a great job and did some great work over the years. I think the ratings for this movie may go up because of the great songs! One thing that disappointed me is that the director should not have included nudity in this film, which is made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this extremely rude watching this with the family! Although, some might find this naked as comedy, it's not something you'd like to watch with parents! I think the best performance was played by Salman and Priyanka. Overall, I think it's a great movie!
