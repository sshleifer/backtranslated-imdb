Miscegenation happens. Susannah Yorke is a bright young woman, Jane Eyre, and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester should be 35 years old. George C. Scott, with white hair, looks and behaves like an arthritic 80. The late uncle of Jane is in better shape! He cracks and growls, unpleasant and gloomy. He looks like an assassin of axes who sent his ax to be sharp; we are not surprised that he keeps a wife caged in the attic! The great love story seems like a sadomasochistic nightmare. There is plenty of darkness in the novel, but Rochester's Bronte is relatively young, athletic, powerful and charming when he chooses to be. He has a good voice and speech, a good mind and a conscience that he tries unsuccessfully to stifle.
