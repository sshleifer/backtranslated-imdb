This is the sound of Stan and Ollie spinning in their graves. <br /> <br /> I will not bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as they are so obvious that they go unsaid. Little things like "All the New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy," though the stars have been dead for more than thirty years when it was made. Little things like that. <br /> <br /> One bad idea would be to have actors making clowns who happen to be called Laurel and Hardy. Worst of all, it may have worked. For a really bad idea, try casting two actors to represent the duo. Ok, they can call themselves nephews, but the end result is the same. <br /> <br /> Bronson Pinchot can be funny. Okay, forget about the strange eccentric "Cousin Larry" in Perfect Strangers, and look at it in True Romance. But here he stinks. It's probably not all his fault and as the director and support cast - all of which are better than the material - he was probably desperate for money. There are those who claim that Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent. This cause is not helped here by Pinchot. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranian? Pakistani? Only in Stan's trademark cry does he come close, though the scream is exaggerated to the point of boredom which is nothing to write home about. Gailard Sartain does a little better like Ollie, but is it like saying the worst - stepping on dog dirt or kicking at knackers? <br /> <br /> Do you remember the originals with split-second timing, intuitive teamwork, and innate kindness? Well, this is completely absent, replaced by two old idiots and jokes so confusing that you could park a bus through the gaps. Considering that the originals had plots that could be summarized in some panels, this one has a long Mummy Hokum (and what a bad title!) Mixed with the fraternity scenario of the boys. I can not claim to have seen each of the Laurel and Hardy films, 108, but I think it's a safe bet that even your nadir was ahead of it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem is that the originals were playing with themselves, or at least using their own accents. At least it seemed natural and not forced, unlike the invented caricatures that Pinchot and Sartain get. And since when Stan did malapropisms, and so many in that? "I was going to give you a standing cremation"; "I'd like to marinate my friend." Stop this! <br /> <br /> Only one notable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown, the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon's L & H comic. Harmon bought the copyright name (as disconcerting to see a Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and was co-director and producer of this farce. <br /> <br /> Questions are plentiful. Would Stan and Ollie make pags if they were alive today? Would they be glass mummies with broken bottles? Has Stan being beaten on the genitals with a spear and ends in a big CGI finale? Let's hope not. <br /> <br /> I laughed once but I think it was only out of disbelief at how terrible all this is. Why was this movie made in the first place? Who do breeders think they would like? Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, an absolute disgust I got tired of watching after only the first five minutes. It's as much fun as having your head stuck in an addiction while a red-hot poker and nettles are forcibly inserted into your back passage.
