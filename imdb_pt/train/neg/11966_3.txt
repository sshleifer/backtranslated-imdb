Bob Clampett's "Porky's Poor Fish" is a cartoon full of terrible puns and one or two nice moments. Set in Porky's Fish Shoppe, Porky's Poor Fish occupies an uncomfortable area between a black-and-white standard Porky cartoon and one of the Merrie Melodies books that were popular back then. Typically of many of the early Porky cartoons, Porky is far from the star, appearing only in a fairly formal musical number and at the climax of the film. For the rest of the time, the star is a shaggy cat who sees the fishmonger as an opportunity for a free meal but earns more than he expected. Unfortunately, the public gets much less than they expected. As was sometimes the case in the books-for-a-life series, the focus is thrown on signs of punishment that could have worked so well in a non-animated medium. The laughter is scarce, and while the cartoon is practically saved by Clampett's energetic direction, there is very little to recommend "Porky's Poor Fish" over any of the other Porky cartoons.
