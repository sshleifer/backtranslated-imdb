Well, God, I'm disappointed. When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, "The Haunting," I feared it would be ruined by an abundance of visual effects the size of a summer movie. But deep down, I had faith. Certainly, with such a talented cast intact ... De Bont and company will not spoil a movie, whose original was a fantastic and scary movie that comprised the delicate art of subtlety. Well, subtlety, where are you now !!? My fears were manifested ... a promising film went awry. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the film is beautifully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never go wrong. But the script puts their great actors to the test ... asking them to deliver the kind of flamboyant dialogue that is only spoken in films. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only artist to flee with some dignity ... and that is little. But the crime of all crimes is that horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imaginations, feel this terrible fear of the fear of the unknown. No, we have some visual effects to show us what we should be afraid of ... and you know what? As beautifully perceived as they are ... the visual effects emerge as a kind of fool. And the climax is a ghostly mess ... but things were terribly wrong long before that. <br /> <br /> Everything in The Haunting is exaggerated and exaggerated. I fear there are no real emotions or noises in this haunted house monstrosity ... just moan. Check out the original instead. <br /> <br />
