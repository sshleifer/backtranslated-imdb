This documentary is a reconstitution of the last years of the career of Betty Page (Paige Richards). The Tennessee teaser was the best-known pin-up queen in history. Her most memorable work came in the 1950s and was photos of fetish, bondage and cat fight "female moves". Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) in her Movie Star News instructed Betty on what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous photos or "bachelor party" movies, but even so, Klaw was accused of distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid legal proceedings. It's no surprise that Betty has a follower cult at the height of her career. The girl next door, with black hair, blue eyes and an hourglass figure dressed in fetish clothes or not, would be mesmerized for decades. After all, it was said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion. This movie really could have been so much better; but good enough to keep interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is impressive in her own right. Bra, panties, strap and hose do not hurt her image at all. Also in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Be aware that this movie may change your heart rate.
