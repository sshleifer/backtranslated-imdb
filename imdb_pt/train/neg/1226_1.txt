Mine, how the mighty have fallen. Kim Basinger is an excellent actress, but she was definitely sloppy when she took on that role. This movie is bad for one particular reason: lapses in logic. Its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all of its plot holes if it had come out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it seems really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> The story details that Della (Kim Basinger) is just beginning to buy gifts at a mall and is besieged by a gang of thugs who end up killing a police officer who came to his aid. Thereafter she is pursued by these idiot bullies through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> So many things are wrong with this movie. As I said, this movie skips logic around every corner and, except for Kim Basinger, the acting is bad for the TV. Hell, this pseudo thriller is made for bad TV. The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian, and 1 African American, all coming together to chase a Caucasian woman. Do not you just love America?) It's laughable to failure. The way she killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main villain was so out in the field on the left that makes you shake your head in shame. I only recommend this to lovers of bad movies and no one else. Anyone else, especially Kim Basinger fans, would do well not to own this movie. Do not you want to see an actress you respect in such a bad movie now you? Of course not. You have been warned.
