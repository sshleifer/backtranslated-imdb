This is the only movie I've ever seen that has led me to write a review on any Internet site, and that's a meaningful statement from someone who likes "The Attack of the Monster Monoliths." This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a harmless movie. It is devoid of sex and violence, for example. I believe this movie is safe for kids of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained, challenged or stimulated in any way. Adults can easily regain sleep in front of the TV while children watch this movie. Do not be surprised, however, if you wake up and find out that the kids have turned off the TV and started a board game. As an adult who likes to be entertained, who likes everything, from the mundane to the fantastic in realism, drama, comedy and action, all those adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination, this movie has nothing to see offer.
