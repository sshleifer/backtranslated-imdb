This movie is very, very poor. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was a bit of tension, but not much to make you jump out of the chair. It begins slowly with the construction of tension. Which is not a success. At least if you ask me. Although at some points or times I should say it was a bit funny when people were shot and how they fell. <br /> <br /> They should have done something like a horror movie, so it could be a better movie. Because I watched only pieces of the movie, skipping scenes and came to annoy the movie. I must say that I felt sleepy watching this movie, so I can certainly say it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time thinking about doing something with this movie, other than leaving it where it is already. Somewhere very dusty ..
