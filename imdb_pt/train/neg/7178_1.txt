Overworked and only for those people in their 20s who wear particularly thick pink glasses, which they never really saw in the first place because they were young. Horrible animation, dialogue and a tired narrative. A real product of the 80s, the new trick of a TOY puzzle (which is not the absurd, pretentious and childish alienating the "collector's action figure"), sold on the back of a poor caricature and other paraphernalia, only matters to those who bought TOY when they were "real" children in the period from '84 'to '87. It became cult because those same adults are immature to leave their memories. Avoid.
