I do not know what you're inhaling, but please stop. This movie was complete trash. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was adorable, cute, sweet, loving and extremely fun to watch. He had this innocence, but at the same time he was strong as well. <br /> <br /> This new kid, Alex? Annoying like all hell! Just a blatant imitation of trying to match Culkin's charm and grace, failing miserably at it. <br /> <br /> The villains, complete crap. Harry and Marv, they were so much fun on the screen crew. They were comical, they were good-humored, and just made you really want to cheer for Culkin even more, which is what a good villain should do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely perfect for these roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who only fight and try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. Not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really that much fun. More on the tacky side, actually. <br /> <br /> So we have the real movies. Part 1 and 2, classics. Memorable. Perfect for watching around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings so many emotions. This makes you fall in love with the story and cares about the characters. Simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? Crappy masterpiece. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone, I do not know why people like it. I think people really do not know what a good movie is anymore. It's a horrible sequel with more unrealistic traps and an idiot kid of the new main character that I'd like the thieves to at least tap into. <br /> <br /> Run, run away from this crap. And let's not even start with Part 4!
