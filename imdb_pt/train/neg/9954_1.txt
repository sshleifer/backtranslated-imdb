From beginning to end, this is the most emotionally exhausted movie about NOTHING I've ever seen. The characterizations and interactions between the title character and the character of Marthe Kller are pure torture. The track as a metaphor is so exaggerated that it borders on the clich√©, but director Pollack treats each closed curve as if it were something profoundly important. <br /> <br /> There may be some value to an MSFT3000 version of some of the scenes, such as Pacino, getting in touch with his inner woman for value. But even this accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
