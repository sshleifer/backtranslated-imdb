This initial role of Barbara Shelley (in fact, she was the first in Britain after working in Italy), was made at the age of 24, and it is certainly safe to say that she made an impressive debut in "Cat Girl" 1957. While blonde and brunette receive most of the attention (I always appreciate Yutte Stensgaard), the lovely red-haired actress with the deep voice always exudes intelligence and vulnerability (one such example is Village of the Damned 1960). that her screen time was much shorter than her character's husband, George Sanders). She is the only reason to see this monotonous update of "Cat People" and is seen as a big advantage everywhere (it's hard to tell if her beauty has found a better showcase). Her character apparently sleeps naked, and we are exposed to her bare and lush back when she is awakened (also exposed 8 years later in "Rasputin-The Mad Monk", 1965). The dazzling dress she wears for the most part the film is a dazzling wonder without straps (I do not see what held that dress, but I sure would like it). All in all, positive proof that Barbara Shelley, in a poorly written paper that would defeat most actresses, rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable, a real test of star power, which she would soon find in the studios of Hammer in Bray, for the duration of the 1960s.
