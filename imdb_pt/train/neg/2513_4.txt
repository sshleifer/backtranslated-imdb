When I first saw this movie, I thought I should have come from the children's section - it's really fun and sometimes humorous, and it's actually a really good story, but it lacks the "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are able to deliver. I should note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the role of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but that is the only exception. This movie seems a bit forced, the direction lacks substance, and oh yeah ... the music is ridiculously horrible, did not leave me in a good mood. But if you're not expecting a clever and well-crafted comedy / romance tale, then this can certainly be fun, as I said ... it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends are a welcome relief from Tim Robbins' boring and almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflicting film, but as long as it's not taken seriously, it can be a good movie.
