An absolutely miserable waste of film !! Nothing happens. No ghost, almost no train, no mystery, no interest. The constant and brutal comedy attempts are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a bunch of people stranded in the middle of nowhere because the train was stationary for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railroad leaves them no room to stay in a heavy storm? I think not. Oh, they can walk 4 miles through the dead black fields. yea. Right. Or they can force themselves on the railroad hospitality and stay at the "haunted" train station. A station that proved to be nothing more than MORTAL CHORING, totally without ghosts, interest or plot. <br /> <br /> So very terribly boring that this seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added. for the list LOST FILMS !! aargh !!
