Yes, he is! ... No, not because of Pintilie likes to undress its actors and publicly show their particularities. Pintilie is the "emperor" naked - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It's a long time for someone to tell the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, a brat trapped in an old man's body. Its abundance of nudity scenes has no artistic legitimacy. It's a 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks making the actors undress and look at their girls. And if he does it in front of the public, he can have a hard cock! Did you know that on the set of "Niki Ardelean," he used to shame poor Coke Bloss, telling her, "Oh, Coke, how I want to fuck you!" She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she was unspeakably ashamed - with her little satisfaction! And, as a disturbing alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in the Romanian public, many people are still so foolish in declaring these visual obscenities "works of art"! Does anyone have the decency to expose the truth of all this?
