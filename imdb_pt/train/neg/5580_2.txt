I really like the actors involved in this project, so being insulted by the film is even worse than if they used a stranger. The main problem was that this film was clearly just a concept created to attract baby boomers. 30 years Nbc will probably make a movie like this in the early 90's. I can now see a black family where children are involved in the riot and the white family has rebellious kids and listen to grunge rock. The soundtrack will feature bands like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden etc. as this will be as flamboyant as the '60s and I guarantee that NBC will do it. See the biggest problem with period pieces when bought networks are when you are living in a certain period of time you are not thinking that I am living in the 60's or any decade is retro trendy in season. Next time someone does something like that, they should put more weight on there design
