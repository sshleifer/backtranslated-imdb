The film attempts to be a mockumentary - filmed in the form of a documentary, but with many parts obviously scripted - but fails to provide the public with any characters with which to create the mockumentary illusion. In addition, the film claims to be a true love in Los Angeles, but nothing more than an unattractive look at an amateur filmmaker who tries to make his first "big movie."
