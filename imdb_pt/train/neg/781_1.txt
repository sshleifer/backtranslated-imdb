This show was absolutely terrible. On the one hand, George is not funny, and his children are snobbish little brats. He also treats his mother without respect. As a Hispanic, I'm very offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed. <br /> <br /> In addition, the dysfunctional family thing was done to the death. For the first time, I want to see something original. What makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times? I thought ABC would fall on itself and take that piece of junk out of the air, but unfortunately, we're going to have to swallow it until they "jump the shark." <br /> <br /> In my opinion, they already did.
