This movie reminded me of the Sopranos, and not in a good way. David Chase's seminal opera only missed twice, the most shocking and inexplicable case occurred in his fourth season when Junior Soprano was on trial for his life. Instead of following this fascinating (and fundamental) plot, the writers chose to ignore it altogether, concentrating instead on Bobby Baccalieri's constant whimpering over his recently deceased wife's plate of frozen dough. <br /> <br /> When something of genuine interest happens in Notorious - for example, the first mysterious assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur that triggered the entire East Coast / West Coast dispute in the first place, and eventually led to death both of Tupac and of Christopher Wallace - the film treats just like another piece of plot to delve into. Why exactly was Tupac so convinced that he was exhausted by his own people? Did he alone harbor his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil 'Kim's transformation from a drone-to-vampire-sex-obsessed-diva bureau so banal as it sounds here? <br /> <br /> None of these issues is fleetingly addressed by the screenwriters of the film, who are much more interested in portraying Wallace's turbulent love life at zero dramatic dramatic advantage. These sequences (including a clich√© groupie's indecority in a hotel room) are so edentulous and painfully manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a networked TV movie. <br /> <br /> The narrative, in both structure and content, is simplistic and banal. But more fundamentally, as a biographical film; as something designed to celebrate his subject and to educate the uninitiated about the complexities of his life and work; the film is almost totally useless. Confidence in the graphic representation of meat and potatoes along with lifeless musical performances (an area in which a movie like this must surely fly) will result in a movie that seems to have been designed just to satisfy the whims and demands of those involved, leaving Wallace's questionable status as a giant in his field as the preservation of the easily persuaded and converted just previously. <br /> <br /> And the final twenty minutes, in which Wallace's posthumous cultural identity is broadly painted to resemble that of a late-time saint, frankly made me want to vomit. <br /> <br /> In this sense, just like any other, Notorious is rude, calculating and committed.
