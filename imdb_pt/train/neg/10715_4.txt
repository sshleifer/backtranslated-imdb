What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie misses it. In fact, it never worked. There was a bit of excitement when we discovered that Angie is not really pregnant, but then she finds out she is, after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was terrible and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, in addition to making it longer. I'd really like to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe I did not try a pure comedy, which unfortunately was not, but maybe a comedic drama. I think if the movie did that, it could have been really funny since both actresses are pretty funny and sitting here I can think of several scenarios that would have been a riot.
