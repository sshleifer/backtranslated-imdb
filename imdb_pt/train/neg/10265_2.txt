Kirstie Alley, looking a little thinner, but just a little bit, is in this mess with a man who looks like MacGuyver, blond and bleached hair and all. The premise of the film is about an older woman (50 !!!) who may not have her screenplay produced due to age discrimination, so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer. It's not an original idea or a very good movie, with poor acting, futile dialogues and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot about a writer with a downfall or admiration for Kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who plays Kirstie's brother is so wooden and miscast, it was torture to watch his scenes. What is there to say about this movie? Avoid this.
