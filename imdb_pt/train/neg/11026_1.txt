I just read a book about Dillinger. This movie was terribly inaccurate. It's as if they have a list of names and just make up everything. Their robberies and escapes were well planned, until the second - when the time was up, they left if they had all the money or not. They had notes of all the roads, where to go, etc. Purvis never saw him in the restaurant, they told him that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never saw Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed, just pictures of him. The way his gang members died was fictitious. Dillinger never stole a bank by himself, as he did in that movie. If I had never read the book, I might have liked the movie. The acting was a little overdone in some places. The action was too exaggerated. On the second thought, I doubt I would have liked it much, even if I had not read the book.
