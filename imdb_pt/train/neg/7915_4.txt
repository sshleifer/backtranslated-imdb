All the X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including the hated X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best, in my opinion), and a good story arc. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I heard this movie was in production, and my expectations grew larger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is The Fountain, although you do not hear about this movie when they talk about the actor), and his acting is not The whole movie is plagued with many meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot (like Blob or Gambit) that were played there to make fans believe the filmmakers had read the original comics. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMen, I read many, many of your stories and this movie did not respect any of them. None. Not even continuity. Does not respect the Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, the motivations for Wolverine are simply stupid and seen in millions of movies: Revenge for the death of a loved one. <br /> <br /> Oh. What I was expecting the whole movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to what he has in X2 at school when the Stryker men arrive and he alone decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is the Fox, this family movie and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome Marvel hero. <br /> <br /> In addition, I had a constant feeling deja v√π with this movie because Origins of Wolverine are already explained in X2, we already know how he got his skeleton of adamantium, so it does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that Wolverine is one of those few characters who does not need a solid story. because mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker got his scars?
