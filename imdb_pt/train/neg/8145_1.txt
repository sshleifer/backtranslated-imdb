This movie is so bad I can not believe it was filmed. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, you crazy? Did we really watch the same movie? Or the same sh ** I must say. Everything is wrong in this movie. The story (is there a story?) Is going nowhere, completely incoherent, acting (some dialogues are simply ridiculous), soundtrack (what is it?), Editing, and especially artistic direction, a pure disaster . Reminds me of the old Macist films ... To give an example of production amateurism, the mermaid's fantasy is a sleeping bag with sequins stuck to it. I'm not kidding, that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Another example of the huge mistakes we find here: you see in one scene an extra, a fat woman of about 200 pounds who is talking about her. cell phone. The next scene, which is in a totally different place, you can see this same woman, still talking on your cell phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> A big, huge waste of money. Useless.
