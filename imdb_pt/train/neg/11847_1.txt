I'm shocked at how bad this movie is. As a pastiche of early 20th century Hollywood artists, it sets a new past, even though The Moderns or Cradle Will & I Rock never thought that I would see a movie worse than those 2. Granted that they were about an environment a little different period. However, the attempts and results were afflicted similarly. <br /> <br /> First, is there the horrible cast: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, do you owe something to this guy? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Sacred smoke, these people do not even begin to try to capture the appearance or sound of the period they are supposedly portraying. <br /> <br /> Well, Last Picture Show was a decent movie, but this thing is a disaster. And the rest of the Bogdonovitch photos were not much better. Guess rubbing against Welles & Hitch & Ford has worn out a long time. Still good for hosting the TCM.
