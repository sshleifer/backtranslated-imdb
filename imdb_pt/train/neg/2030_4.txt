The comment of "eliz7212-1" reaches the proverbial "nail in the head" for this turkey of a program. But it is a joke to see William Shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the "" brands in the word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and ranks a few stars to see more or less Shatner, who seems to have taken the "camp" to new heights - whether on paper or himself. . But the guy is funny. <br /> <br /> Girls in the cubicle areas with game data scrolls will be very unlucky when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a rebirth the whiskey-a-go-go, with a demand resurrected by well-formed young women to dance in high cages once again. <br /> <br /> I noticed the first competitor, who was boring and literally "dumber than a: post", still out of luck, left with a quarter of a thousand or more. The second competitor, a little smarter, but lucky to win $ 1,000 in Jeopardy !, was attacked by the card that required an answer to a special question - which he did not know and therefore left with zilch. <br /> <br /> This plethora of gaming programs, which rock and sometimes give large sums to individuals of everyday life, is admittedly a cheap effort, generally, to try to attract viewers. Even if the host is well rewarded, and they donate six numbers in an average episode, I suppose the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you do not have a sitcom cast where multiple stars are getting six or seven numbers per episode , with some major residual deals as well. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the best will wear out in no time. This has almost reached this point. I think his offerings, especially with James Spader, and the others on "Boston Legal" should give us a satisfactory amount of Bill Shatner's offerings. <br /> <br /> Again, the above rating is simply appropriate to see Bill hoot and prance, maybe once; that should be enough.
