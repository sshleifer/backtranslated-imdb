To be brutally honest ... I LOVED Severed. That's why I gave him a 1/10 stars because of his story / shooting / acting / everything that is absolutely unimaginative. <br /> <br /> This movie was a RIOT to watch. If you like watching bad movies to mock them, you'll really like Severed. <br /> <br /> The story does not really matter, it involves a guy who is bald and has a sword and goes around beheading random people. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural touch ... no one ever sees him do it. <br /> <br /> Even when, in a memorable scene, he enters a jabacked nightclub and knocks a little on a girl's pasta and no one sees. <br /> <br /> Severed does not seem to just have been shot on video - it was shot on someone's video camera. The filmmakers had knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition really holds true in some scenes. But most of the time you can not hear <br /> <br /> the actors ... you can not understand what they're doing, and you laugh <br /> <br /> when the next victim gets your pumpkin of your body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. Support movies like this - they're a joke and a hollar!
