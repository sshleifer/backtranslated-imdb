In short, the film had a weak first act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and rhythm, a bit of a decent second act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent rhythm and some inferior performances by the cast, and the third act ... there was virtually NO ANY THIRD ACT! <br /> <br /> In relation to the third act, the film ends abruptly. There is no resolution and no path of the climax of the second act, so there was not much of a third act. The bad guys die and that's it; the final credits roll. There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on. The audience probably would have left the theater after the movie, asking "is that it?" A real disappointment. <br /> <br /> The song was composed by David Bell, who worked properly enough to serve the film most of the time, but certainly not exceptional at all. It's just functional, but you get it being merely generic and derivative. It is also evident that the score is VERY dated with the use of synthesized eardrums for some of the percussions. What struck me less about the scoreboard is that some moments of tension announce musical signals sounding as if they had been wrested from James Horner's "48 HRS." and "Commando", particularly bronze. <br /> <br /> In all, the film had potential, because the basic story itself is good, but the execution was dull, with mediocre direction, weak performance and a rather incoherent rhythm. <br /> <br /> There was virtually no third act to adequately finalize the story, and this omission is important and unforgivable, as it does not allow the film to end satisfactorily. This could be the script or possibly the production had to cut the footage or edit the third act in the final film due to budget constraints (but I'm speculating on why there is no third act). Whatever the reason, the abrupt ending really hurts the movie in general. <br /> <br /> This is good for a view if you are curious and you can get the movie to VERY cheap as well as to learn the reason WHY you need to have the 3 acts (beginning, middle, end) if you write scripts and make movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not want to waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version at least to get a few laughs out of it.
