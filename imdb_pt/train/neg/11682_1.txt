Now is not it? Considering all the good work done by danzel, Clive and Jodie, the film has never turned into anything more than a horrible die-hard / heist film copier. Yes, some jokes, no unpredictable twists, to be honest, the only unpredictable moments are there because the director and editor made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame for them and a waste of time for us. If anyone can tell me why the hell they were digging a hole in that vault, who the hell is the Rebbe and how they knew the diamonds were in the particular cell, it might just make my day, but it seems like Spike asks us to give a lot of importance to this kind of thing, and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid ... it's just another studio contract to relax and enjoy ...
