Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a high-class housewife who lives in a private suburban condominium with her twin children and abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all the attention to the twins, neglecting her house and her appearance and disturbing Kenneth. On Christmas Eve, she drives to the local mall in the evening to buy wrapping paper for gifts, and finds no parking space available. When she sees an old car parked in two places, she leaves a message to the owner calling him "selfish idiot." When the mall closes, Della's car is held by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), African-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Singer-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin American Tomás (Luis Chávez). When the mall's security guard protects her, he is shot in the head by Chuckie, Della speeds up her car trying to escape the criminals. However, she knocks her truck near a forest while pursued by the gang. She picks up the toolbox and hides in the woods, fighting the gang to survive. <br /> <br /> A couple of days ago, I saw the trailer for "While She Was Out" and I was looking forward to watching the DVD. Unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie, and I'm totally disappointed with this collection of monotonous and implausible cliches. Della Myers is portrayed as an insecure and negligent housewife and nonexistent as a wife; motherhood is her only interest in her family concept. She is pursued by four criminals, but she defeats them with a toolbox that appears to be Batman's utility belt. So the plot is so absurd that it annoys. The gang of criminals is made up of the favorite cliché of American films, with an African American, a Sino-American and a Latin along with an American lord to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent acting, but her kids are too young for a fifty-five-year-old woman. My vote is four. Title (Brazil): "While She's Out"
