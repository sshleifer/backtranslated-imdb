** SPOILERS ** This is a bad movie. Seriously. Acting absolutely horrible, the FX is terrible and the plot is horribly wrong. But hey, it's so bad that it's fun to watch! The script is so bad it's fun! You just have to shrink and laugh at lines like "I think it's what you call CROCTEASING". while women blink their breasts in the crocodile. I mean, it's funny because it's so bad! It has horrible jokes that are funny! But after a while, it becomes as much as the movie turns into junk. I really started falling asleep. Trust me, however, the plastic crocodile foot hitting the leaves and the constant movements of a tail well keep laughter for a long time. Although I have to say I had a cool part when the crocodile tore that guy in half and he stood there for a while, trying to figure out what to do. Heh heh meaningless movie, which has to be named for the MST3K line !!
