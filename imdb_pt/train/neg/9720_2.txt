This movie is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> He tries to copy some borrowed effects to a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's too much. The dialogues are very bad, some of the worst I've heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I almost never found him very convincing), his father in the movie plays very poorly, the story is dumb, the end is .. stupid. <br /> <br /> I do not think I like a movie so much since Christophe Gans' "le pacte des loups" (and watch / see about 80-100 films a year), but at least film had some action and many good actors. <br /> <br /> I had never commented here (only rated), and when I saw the rating and the comments, I thought I had to write I think we will have no problem selling the DVD that we were offered: not a movie so bad in our (large) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I am open minded (I watch SF, westerns, drama, comedies, silences, horror, fantasy ... movies!), but this movie was so annoying that I felt like I lost an hour and a half.
