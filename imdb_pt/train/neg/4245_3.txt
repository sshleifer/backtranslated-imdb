Was this movie based on actual events? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We begin to see what seems to be numerous armed police evacuate an equal amount of guns on 2 guys who only have armored torso. That's a great idea; point at armor! ... excuse me, but how about those fat heads not to be missed or the legs to scream out loud. Or were there invisible tanks protecting them? Were they from Crypton? Did I miss anything here? <br /> <br /> This movie started decent enough, but after 20 minutes of filming it really becomes a boredom. <br /> <br /> And that documentary style did not work for me either, but that's something that you might find nice or not. <br/> <br/> Highly unbelievable things that make it difficult to see until the end. <br /> 3/10 for good editing.
