I saw this movie during an interim lecture with a Tolkien theme during my sophomore year of college. I was sitting unfortunately near the screen and my teacher chose me to serve as a boy whipping, everyone was laughing, but they were not within constant vision. Let's get him out of the way: Peter Jackson's films, "Lord of the Rings," owe something to the movie Bakshi. In Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, for example, the scene in which the Black Riders assaulted the inn's empty beds is almost a complete copy of the shot scene of the Bakshi movie. You could call this plagiarism or homage, depending on your schedule. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities do not stop there. I will not do any research to find out what they are because it would imply that I have a little respect for this movie. I'm sure others have described the similarities - look around. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete disaster in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological way - if I left out anything else that offended me is because I am completely overwhelmed, confronted with a lot of flaws (and, in high points, heavy use of rotoscopy, Gandalf is no longer a gentle and wise witch, but a savage prophet of doom (whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film). <br /> <br /> * Saruman, the white, is sometimes called "Aruman" during the film, without explanation. He uses purple and red for some mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> Sam is completely crazy. The portrait of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childlike and unsatisfying. Yes, hobbits are small like children, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> Merry and Pippin are never introduced - they simply appear during a scene change with an explanation of a phrase. The movie is full of sloppy editing like that. <br /> <br /> Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are singing happily as they pass the road. One of the hobbits gets a lute at least twice as large as he on the back - which was not visible before - and begins to pick out the typical fashion of a fantasy bard, as they all become "la-la-la ". AWFUL. Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotyped fantasy coat (no pants), complete with a huge square belt buckle. He is undoubtedly the worst swordsman in the entire film - often he takes stock before being knocked over in his butt. <br /> <br /> The Black Knights seem more leprous than threatening instruments of evil. They clean everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace. This is disturbing to be sure, but not scary. <br /> <br /> The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen (where they face Frodo, who is on the other side of the horse) continues forever, during which the Riders mount their horses from one vaguely threatening and ... they do nothing else. The scene was probably intended to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline when he succumbed to his wound. It ends up being more laborious than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli, the Dwarf, is as tall as Legolas, the Elf. He is a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for this. He also looks like a bastard David the Gnome. It is a crude description but accurate. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have stolen Elmer Fudd's golden Viking armor from that episode of the opera Bugs Bunny. He looks ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the resemblance to Tolkien's illustration, the Balrog is the inducing howl and the least threatening villain in the entire film. It looks like someone wearing pink slippers and is a little taller than Gandalf. "Purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I'll take the Jackson version sometime. <br /> <br /> * The battle scenes are embarrassing and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters exhibits any level of competence with their armaments. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's movie, but they should be fighting. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very short appearance, and I'm sorry he bothered to show up at all. Watch the movie, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Alright, now for the GOOD parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the voiceovers are very good. It's not that Aragorn Sound is bad, he just looks like the Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> Galadriel is a little interesting in this picture; like Tom Bombadil, she seems immune to the Tempting powers of the Ring, and her actress voice is not awful either. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as painful as in Jackson's picture of the same scene, but it is still appropriately dramatic (and more faithful to his death in the book, although I do not believe that Jackson has committed one photographed the way he did). As my teacher pointed out (among whispered threats), the orcs (mostly in Helm's Deep, if I am correct) resemble the corpses of war-torn soldiers, a political statement that works very well if you realize what you are being tempted. While this is not really a plus point about the movie, Bakshi can not be blamed for most of the failures in this movie, or so I was told - the project was on a tight budget, and by the end of your movie. production he lost creative control to some of the superiors (which I'm sure had not read the books). <br /> <br /> Let me be clear: I respect Bakshi for trying to even something Hing of that magnitude. I simply have a hard time believing that he was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughs, unless you have already read the books and have your own views of the characters, places, and events . I'm sure someone, somewhere, will get a copy of this in confusion; if you do, keep an open mind and see what is good about it.
