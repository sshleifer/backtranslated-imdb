I do not know what this movie is about, really. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always darkness except for seconds per day. There are long, interrupting shots of insects of all kinds, without reason. The small dialogue that exists in the film is as insane and meaningless as the images. A black woman enters the apartment of the main character. Somehow she gets pregnant during the night, then gets shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white nude woman emerges. I've never been so impressed with how bad and meaningless a movie can be. Honestly, I'd like someone to watch so they can tell me what they think it is. But I would not wish that level of hell on anyone else.
