A painfully prolonged, mushy and predictable drama, my twenty-fifth Sidney Lumet movie, Garbo Talks, is filed hastily at the end of my low-quality quest. <br /> <br /> The film documents a young worker named Gilbert. (Ron Silver), son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, moody and above all obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle suffers from a brain tumor, her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of himself: track down Greta Garbo and bring her to her mother. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is in full, chewing-the-scene mode Auntie-Mame here, that kind of moody girl that the movie loves, where she talks to people, and defends her ideals, and ends up in jail all the time. She stands outside the film as an obvious artificial construction, and every scene with her is limp and yuk-yuk; each note marked false. The rest of the characters are equally one-dimensional, but tremendously less interesting. Ron Silver is flat as can be, and his love triangle attempt is as telegraphed as anything else in the film: he is dating affluent Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but falls in love with eccentric colleague Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), and I called each scene three scenes before they happened. <br /> <br /> That's the other problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are put into an intriguing and captivating story, but there is simply nothing here. The rhythm of the film is glacial, resplendent with strange material that does not strengthen anything at all, and when the film begins to follow a linear plot, it is arduous and uninteresting. There are many invited stars, so to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker (imagine this) in yet another highly non-essential scene. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, he tries to reach half. a decent statement about the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but at that time, none of the characters exist as real people, and the movie bored me into submission, so it works like a case of too little, too late. The film is my twenty-fifth film directed by Lumet, making him easily my most-watched director, but out of some notable errors (The Stranger Among Us?), He did not plumb the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks. . <br /> <br /> {Grade: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (out of 24) of 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumet movies}
