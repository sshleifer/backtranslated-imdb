I suppose if you like endless dialogue that does not convey the camera's flashy story and effects, like the scene transitions on the _Angel_ television show, you'll enjoy the movie. I? All I wanted was a little good story, and it was not there. The pace was almost behind schedule, the plot points were buried under a sea of ​​unnecessary dialogs, and there was absolutely no feeling of dread or tension, or ANYTHING. <br /> <br /> Is it redneck? Is it Wendigo? No, he's a cameraman at speed. This is not scary. It does not generate a single note of tension or atmosphere, unless you are afraid of MTV. Like those reviewers before me, I also realized that by the end the movie invokes mocking laughter from the audience. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie.
