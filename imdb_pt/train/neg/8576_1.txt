Solid entertainment comedy, with musical interludes, creates a fast pace that drives the proceedings in a lively pace through a maze of humorous complications and chiller. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong configuration of sinister villainy. The script contains all the standard mystery movies - sliding panels, secret passages, thunders and lightning and poisoned darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre go after obvious heavy and melodramatic readings of the gaslit era. Kay Kyser and his band offered great entertainment to people living in the 1940s who were trying to forget the horror of World War II.
