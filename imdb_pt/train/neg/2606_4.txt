Drew Barrymore portrays young Holly Gooding, who moves in with aspiring screenwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely disturbs her life claiming that her "doppelganger", or evil twin, is willing to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This horror movie is kind of hard to take seriously, even if the filmmakers and the actors seem to be serious. "Doppelganger" is confusing, with some disagreeably idiotic dialogue. Some viewers will note that the name of Drew's character was taken from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and that the name of the character of Newbern is a game named after the famous author Patricia Highsmith (he's actually trying to rewrite "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I suppose it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror movie - I mean, writer / director Avi Nesher seems genuinely to care about his characters, and gives his film more plot than a standard slasher. <br /> <br /> After a silly villain-explains-all-to-the-confrontation with the public, the film goes on to present a heinous and extravagant climax that needs to be seen to be believed. This film certainly does not save on the blood. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew kills her mother on this. No, I'm not joking. Jaid Barrymore appears near the beginning only to be struck down violently. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very watchable and very sexy on this one. Newbern comes out as a friendly and "nice" guy. But the high point of the movie has to be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in her single scene as a former nun who started a phone sex business (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is basically junk, but quite entertaining on a small sleazy and sleazy level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
