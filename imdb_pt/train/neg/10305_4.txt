As an engineer, I must say that the first season of this program started very promising. Most of the applied mathematics was somewhat plausible, and the relations portrayed between the brothers and father of Eppes gave an interesting advantage to the program. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show began to degrade, heavily. Most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving today is totally meaningless and laughable to everyone involved with science and technology. The involvement of the actors still looks good and I can imagine The amount of money still goes into producing each episode, but in the end, this has degraded to a very nasty tasting dish which is a mix of a C-class action thriller and a CSI-style police show. <br /> <br /> You will watch it, go only for the first season and possibly parts of the second. After that, I would not waste my time. I even did the show in the middle of season three. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> Let's sum up this up to 4 stars. As Charlie no longer knows his math, I will not bother with the accuracy of mine either.
