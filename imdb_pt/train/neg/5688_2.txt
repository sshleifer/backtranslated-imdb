Short version: The seed is not useless. It's just derivative and inferior. And without soul. Long Version: If you've never seen any of the films that make up the vaguely defined "psychological horror" genre, this movie will probably melt your face. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. The initial montage of real animal abuse will be enough to open your eyes to the possibilities of video brutality, and the gore scene (only) memorable at the end of the movie will be perhaps more than you can handle. The climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has. <br /> <br /> But if you do not have much experience with the genre. If you've seen the real thing ... "August Underground's Penance", for example, you'll have, like me, a lot of trouble staying up until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers compared this to the old problems of video. I understand that comparison. Like nasties video, "Seed" is more violent than a mainstream and less subtle horror movie. But the reason why videos are still known to us is not just for the reasons above - those that are still popular had something special. Let me be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who stayed around had "soul". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of the Burial Ground, in an interview on the new DVD: "... we will never have more movies like these, because today technology has surpassed and the technology is cold so many things will disappear because little movies like these will no longer be produced.Today we have some great tricks that are very expensive but they are cold.Today, a horror, such a terrorist movie costs more than one million dollars.These movies were not so expensive ... they are real effects, made with our hands. "It may be wrong to take the comparison to the old school horror so seriously. But Crisanti was right on the head. Even in its most exploitative appearance, the best of the evils of the video pursued a primitive "truth." And that's where Boll falls short. It's as if he had seen the movies and did not understand them. Everything on the list is there ... BS about "making a statement about humanity", an obscene torture scene, etc. But it is, as Crisanti says, "cold." Blood is all CGI. The whole thing looks like scenes gathered from other films of various genres. And the pace is so slow. Dude, so slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: the scene of a gore really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough BS. Weak movie.
