Hunters chase what they think is a man through the forest, although the public sees that he is a werewolf. Hunters never seem to realize this, because after they shoot him, he seems normal when he beheaded. <br /> <br /> A doctor transplants the werewolf's eyes into a man who has lost his own in a laboratory experiment. The man, Rich, can have sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before even removing his bandages. <br /> <br /> After he leaves the hospital, he discovers that his wife is also cheating on him. When a smoke machine sends clouds through an amateur painting of a moon (with a fake tree branch in the foreground), it turns into a werewolf! His torso grows, splitting his shirt, and he creates a giant werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in his eyes. Your pants remain intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, though some kind of robotic (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows gives it a sinister look at times. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a good amount of blood and blood, and those are reasonably well done. There is even a very good decapitation afterwards in the film. However, when a man falls from a height, a bad doll does the job. Rich has a friend named Siodmak who is some kind of occult specialist, and he accidentally stumbles on a small man with crutches called Androse, who is also a specialist. They try to help you a little. <br /> <br /> Rich kills people who have done it wrong. A police officer investigates the murders and tries to beat Beaton, who does not care much about lesbian scenes, so nothing comes of it. <br /> <br /> Very cheap, but between nudity and blood and blood, and a terrible no-matching History (more or less) The Most Dangerous Game with the Hands of Orlac and the Man of the Wolves, is a little funny. Available on their own, or in the box set Scream Queens Vol. 1
