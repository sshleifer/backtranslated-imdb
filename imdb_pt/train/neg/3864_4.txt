Just a regular Jason Lee movie, there were some parts of the movie that were funny. The tone of the movement is to live life on the edge, I think. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at pajama parties. It was a right movie. It's one of those movies you have in the background and looks from time to time for when something catches your eye. I think Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. He's just a guy who knows a girl's movie. This is the perfect movie they would show in the Central comedy. I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But I guess that's why I did not see it in the movies.
