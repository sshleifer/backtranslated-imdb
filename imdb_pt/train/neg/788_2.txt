A movie with very little positive to say for him. <br /> <br /> First, it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama. <br /> <br /> In addition to being incredibly slow, Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same material repeatedly. I lost count of how many times I had seen "that" field at night or that piece of cracked earth. <br /> <br /> It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the public does not know about things, they will be grabbed instead of just confused. So, with no signs that there is a problem, we suddenly find that marriage is not what it seems to be, even though it feels right. We think Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe, since he does not seem to spend time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a completely useless acre. Beth has a key to a bookstore? There are numerous other issues, some of which are resolved later in the film, much later, in fact, very late. <br /> <br /> And on the acre spot. Do horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are not inherently scary? and also if they are made to be a great acre, then make them so. <br /> <br /> There is also a frightening lack of reasonableness as Beth (the best performer in the play, followed by Jefferson ??) suddenly seems to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on "medication". <br /> <br /> With the full ten minutes more running through the fields looking for the missing child (he crawled out the window? He's six months old) the movie comes down on a badly written scene after a poorly written scene. Bad plinky plonk "horror" music can not add atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often bad movies can be fun, but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.
