I went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about, and I was as disappointed as I was surprised to have 6 (?) Oscars and 7.9 points in IMDb as of today. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Bigelow must be the luckiest director who has ever won the best picture and best direction of the Oscars for this kind of really bad movie and I wonder why? Does the totally unrealistic "bombboy" cowboy plot mean something to someone I have not seen? Why did I continue to get the mental image that this movie was a remake of some old western movie about a cowboy doing "brave deeds" in the Wild West, infected with "evil" red Indians; but only that it was set in a different context this time around? Was it given the Oscar because the director was ex-James Cameron, and did a nice story (gossip) for TV shows during the day to chew? Or was it some kind of Emperor's Clothing syndrome - where most people realized it was rubbish, but simply could not say it because the others did not seem to say it out loud? <br /> <br /> And finally what was there with that sniper scene where they showed the casing falling in high resolution, super slow, as if conveying a "deep message" or something? Something on the lines of 'EOD guys make good shooters all of a sudden and they're going to have filthy terrorists all the time'? Was it just me who felt that there were so many pieces here and there in the film squeezed for no apparent reason? And you can get the Oscar editing and direction for it? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait until they get on TV in a couple of years. You will not miss much.
