I think it sucked in the ice because it left the cube, and gave us a lot of information about what it is and why. The original CUBE never left the cube and left everything to their imagination. This crap fest however, gives you everything. and I did not like it ... Although the acting is solid, I think the reason this was a fall was because it was made by people other than the original filmmakers, if they had Vincenzo Natali doing this prequel, or even sequel I I think I would have done better and would have been more faithful to the source. so I recommend you stay away, far from it, and HYPERCUBE, another movie that I do not even want to discuss ... (I gave a 2 just to act)
