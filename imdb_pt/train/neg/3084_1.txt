this is the result. A piece of junk movie that does not even deserve to be categorized as a movie, is just a bunch of stuff on a film roll, which makes no sense at all. Well back to the actors, who from the beginning seem to be just a bunch of friends who thought they would get a small amount of money together and try to make a movie that would be a great horror movie. Well, it's a great horror anyway, it's no longer a movie. There's a lot of horrible acting in "Hobgoblins," but the worst is the main guy named Richard, who's just kind of too weak to devote to it. Well, when you make a lot of friends and try to make the movie scary, with a budget less than the minimum, that's what's going to happen. Well, at least the MST3K version was hilarious. But this is still a horrible movie, which deserves the whole attack. 9 for the MST version.
