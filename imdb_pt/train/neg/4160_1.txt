This was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched with a large group of friends and after it was over, none of us understood the plot. Besides the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. The only redeeming factor in the movie is that it's so incredibly bad that it's pretty funny. You can not help laughing at a zombie being run over while the actors are spewing out low-quality dialogues. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh. Now it's a joke between my friends and me. 1 in 10.
