Letting the class watch this in English was a bad idea. Films that are serious and educational may have an effect, but it does not seem to have any effect on the lesson - whenever the teacher left, the conversations started quickly - and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Tempest" being used in all. And when you look at it, it's easy to see why. The acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored, just reading the page without caring about the world. Shakespeare always preferred the expository dialogue to action and death, but I just could not understand a word someone was saying. The costumes are not so bad nor the special effects - the class may not have loved the movie, but they were not picking up the p * ss. But it's hard to play in a movie that is devoid of any kind of inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the beginning of the movie were not very badly made - although the rain seemed a bit unreal, everything else was well done. But where were the severed heads and the masts exploding? Where did death go? Where was the inspiration? Ariel's character would have been taken much more seriously if he was wearing clothes - but since everything was on display, it was just another excuse for a joke. This film is by no means attractive to both sexes. Women and girls will have no romance or comedy to enjoy, and there are plenty of nude men and lack of action or death that will ward off most men and boys. The Tempest was not badly made, but that seemed like something the producers had to do, not something they wanted to do. And the general boredom and lack of inspiration show. 3/10
