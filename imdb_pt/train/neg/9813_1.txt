... and I've seen some bad ones. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this movie. The performance is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as you would expect. Daryl Hannah does a good job but nothing close to being able to save this movie. The biggest flaw in this movie is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer resorted to the "stupid heroine's trick" to create an artificial suspense. When all Daryl Hannah has to do is hide, she runs in front of her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without exposing much of what goes through a plot, I think it would be difficult for a bloody little woman to take a pregnant woman from a hospital without being noticed. Lame. Very lame. <br /> <br /> Save some time and choose another movie.
