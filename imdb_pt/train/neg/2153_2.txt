The 3-D featured in "The Man Who Was not There" depicts DUMB, DUMB, DUMP! This inept comedy features awful 3D effects that make the 3-D effects on "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3" look better by comparison. Not to mention the film is asinine to the extreme. This was one of the many films of 1983 to present the pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor got stuck in this mess, but at least they did not kill their careers. Drummer would star in HBO's "Larry Sanders Show," and Ron Howard's blockbuster hit "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," while Guttenberg followed that failure with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon." What they on those projects instead of them here in "The man who was not there". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (of four)
