This is one of the best celebrity reality shows. we can see the shows, we can see the life of Britney, I love the five episodes. I was always being surprised by Britney and the themes of the show I think some people do not watch the show in all we can as a great person her him. she is really funny, very kind and loves her fans and we can see how she loves her job. I just do not give 10 because of k-fed, he's a real jerk, he does not seem to like Britney. I do a second season of this great show because it shows to some people how Britney really is. Go Britney your best and you will never leave our hearts.
