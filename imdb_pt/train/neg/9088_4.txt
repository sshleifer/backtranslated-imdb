It has been said several times - at least for me - that watching an Eric Rohmer movie is like watching paint dry; it seems that Monsieur Rohmer resents this (he does not deny it, but as he could, he just resents it) so much that his new film, which can also be his last, Inch Allah, is so far away. time that is like watching woad dry. Those wonderful people who gave you the Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema, have already named you one of the best films of 2007, so that should give you an idea. Reality is not at the top of Rohmer's agenda, so that in fifth-century France we have at one end a castle that would not be out of place in the Loire Valley, while the only other dwelling we see is a rough hut of wood. The story involves nymphs and shepherds and, as it always does, Rohmer threw it with strangers who happened to be passing, so the overall effect is that the annual class at a school for students with Special Needs was captured in the film by accident. One is almost tempted to say, "Come back, Godard, all is forgiven," but even this pitiful production can not make me utter those words.
