If this series was supposed to be an improvement over Batman - The Animated Series, I, for example, think it failed terribly. The character's drawing sucks ... (Catwoman, for example, looks horrible ...) But what really bothered me is that it made Batman look like a kind of coward who just can not handle himself in a battle without the help of two, up to three helpers. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comics, I know the Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batman's allies, plus Robin, but still ... making Batman say that he needs their help ... What, he Can not take some punches? In BTAS, he could face a dozen opponents without any problem ... Is he getting old? Come on ... <br /> <br /> And another thing: I do not really think that Batman would allow a boy like Tim Drake to go to battle so early, without years of hard training. One, it's irresponsible (and Batman is all but irresponsible), and two is not what happened in the comics if we want to stay true to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The Animated Series made history, with its animation, its stories and its characters ... This really was a Batman legend. The New Adventures series turned the legend into just one more Batman movie.
