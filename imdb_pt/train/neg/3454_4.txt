Cut tries to be as most post-scream slashers have tried to be, a parody of the horror genre that tried to be clever when referring to other famous horror films. Now, I'm not bagging 'Scream' because I think 'Scream' is a really good horror movie that does a great job of mixing horror and comedy. Cutting fails at most levels. He has his moments but overall it just does not work, not even as a movie "so bad it's good", just below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so are OK and set the story pretty well, plus the fact that Kylie Minogue can not really act, and ironically she sticks her tongue out, go figure. Go forward a little and a group of film students wants to finish their movie, which is apparently cursed. And, as you probably predicted, one by one, the cast and crew are slowly chosen by a masked madman. <br /> <br /> Non-original plot, bad acting and a predictable ending are some of the elements that follow. There are plenty of references in the film, from "Scream" to "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". That too is not smart, it seems the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror films like Scream. For a slasher there is a minimum of gore and no nudity, which is a big negative point when it comes to a slasher that does not have much for that. Actually, I should be supporting this film because I'm Australian and we're not that good when it comes to terror (we have our jewelry, though), but Cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, he kept me watching for the 90 minutes, so that's a good thing, at least. I would not recommend this to anyone other than hardcore slasher fans who may be able to enjoy what this movie is trying to point out but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
