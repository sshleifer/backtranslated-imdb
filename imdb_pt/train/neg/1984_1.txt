An absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It's amazing to me that this movie was really made. Hip-hop and the old westerns do not seem to mix. In what target audience these people thought when they planned this shipwreck. <br /> <br /> Not only is the concept and plot a joke, but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this movie nightmare makes a whole career a laughingstock. The clueless girl should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue, she should be asking which of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research, I actually found a list of other actors who have gone through this movie: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I'd rather look at a blank TV than watch this movie again.
