Encouraged by the positive comments about this movie here, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad mistake. I've seen more than 950 films and this is really one of the worst - it's horrible in almost every way: editing, rhythm, plot, 'acting', soundtrack (single movie song - a lame country song - is not played less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and it's annoying in the extreme. I've rarely been so happy to see the final credits of a movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps me from giving a grade 1 is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance, he seems to be making a little effort. One for obsessive Keitel only.
