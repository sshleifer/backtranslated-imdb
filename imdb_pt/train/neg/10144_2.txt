As Steven Segal's films go this is the bottom of the barrel. His best was just fodder for bored teenagers. This tilts the scale and then falls. The characters are all cardboard. The story is twofold. I can not ruin counting the end. You already know how all Steven Segal's films end if you've ever seen one. Here goes. He is a super-dooper government agent who knows too much to let go, so they decide, instead of killing him, dope his brain until he does not remember to squat. He escapes, of course, is arrested and is located by his old general who needs a man in a million experience to retrieve a sneaky plane that was delivered to a terrorist group in Afghanistan by an Air Force pilot who, surprise Surprise, Segal trained. All heroes, except the character of Segal and his somber girlfriend, die heroically and Steve-Baby saves the whole world in a single swell or falls. Whatever. Made with some surplus of the Air Force and the Navy flying movie. And lots of booms. Get some Popeye drawings instead.
