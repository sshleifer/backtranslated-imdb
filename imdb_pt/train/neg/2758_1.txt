I'm giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in the IMDb rating system. This movie was horrible. It was very misunderstood, the story was poorly written, the action was unbelievable. I doubt that even the Salvation Army could fight as badly as the troops did in this movie. I will not even write any spoilers because the movie is not good enough for spoilers. Writing comments about the plot would be useless. If I were to compare this movie, I would have to compare it to Reign of Fire, however, although I did not like Reign of Fire, this movie at least was better than this. <br /> <br /> Some of the people in the theater left before the movie even got in the way. The only reason I did not was because I simply did not think to do it. I was hoping for a CGI feast and fighting masterfully done, but that was not what happened. The martial arts lasted 30 seconds and this was the result of an exercise routine done during the flashback scene, very disappointing. The CGI was not well done either. A scene comes to mind. During one of the previous tank battles, the troops are firing at ...... nothing. Someone forgot to give the animation guys a chance in that movie, so the street was totally devoid of bad guys. I'm also thinking that the bandit's voice was dubbed by Imotep's voice from the Mummy movies. There was that same irregular, echoing thing going on. (Someone owed some royalties here?) Ever since I mentioned the fight scene, I'll say this can be considered a spoiler, but only for the purists, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this. , do not buy the DVD when it comes out as well. You have been warned.
