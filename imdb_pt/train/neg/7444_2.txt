Unless you are petrified of Russian people or wild boars, this movie is a snorefest. In fact, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and had to fight the urge to leave the theater. I want to have. A waste of a perfectly lovely Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Even "Silent Hill" was more frightening. Heck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was scarier. I'm still not clear on what should be scary in this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I'm very suspicious of movies that use "pidgin Russian" like this in the opening credits. It's embarrassing for me since I brought a bunch of my Russian friends and we all shrunk. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably you too) this movie has already escaped my brain and I just left an hour ago. So I have no details, just obscure visuals going nowhere and some hopeful, now dead, that anything would happen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I've seen a completely mutilated version of this movie because I can not believe it. I got great reviews here (and that's why I saw it) and ended up being completely devoid of terror and suspense, but also of the overall entertainment value. <br /> <br /> I give 2 because, yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and did not leave.
