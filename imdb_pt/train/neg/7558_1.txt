Whatever you do, do not waste your time on this useless one. movie. A remake that did not have to be retold. Everyone leaving the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money !!! Nicolas Cage was riding his bicycle in the hills, swimming in murky waters and down hills while being attacked by bees, but still his suit was still perfectly pressed and the white shirt very last scene. <br /> <br /> Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage acting was as unbelievable as the film itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad movies. They do not get a copy of the script first. If you still have some interest in watching the movie, at the very least, expect it to come out on DVD.
