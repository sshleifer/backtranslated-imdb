If fully juvenile, regressive, self-indulgent, anti-establishment, anti-youth civilization appeals to you, then this is the ideal movie. Very poorly written, with often inaudible dialogues and infuriatingly exhausting cameras everywhere, this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic Manichaean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are insensitive and stumbling in the best of hypotheses. and predatory monsters at worst. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is the abundance of primitive shouts (yawns) and infantile regressions (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the forest, with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again, in the woods (of course ...). It shows all the weaknesses of a first movie and much more besides.
