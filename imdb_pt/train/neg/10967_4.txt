Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent movies. And I like low budget B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I even like bad interpretations, complicated scripts, wooden lines, improbable situations, and the like. However, I did not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on many levels. For all the reasons listed above and many others. This includes the absurd and brazen use of images of the female genitalia. And the many allusions to the male genitalia, in a very Freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is purely by ineptitude. Unlike some attempt to do something really different. I mean, any movie that takes years to film, simply can not maintain the level of congruence and focus required by the modern audience. <br /> <br /> I hoped the whole movie was just a dream or a hallucination of the main character. . However, unfortunately, it was made to happen, as we saw things unfolding on the screen. <br /> <br /> About the only kindness I can express, is that the image at the end was great. If this had been used in the beginning, instead of the end, it could have allowed the film to take off where the year 2001 ended ... <br /> <br /> For evil, they did not try it. I just do not understand what was so important about this movie that it had to be done. Was it the plot? Certainly, it could not be. Were the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without knowing about Ed 15. Was it the dialogue? Not emphatically. The music? Perhaps, but it is more likely that the ego without decorations of the directors needs to be caressed. Much better effort died on the cutting room floor.
