This movie is not only bad, not just tacky, it's repulsive. Something about Daphne, about the scary girl program, about the whole movie (and I use the word literally) radiates a grotesque that would offend a brothel lover. This movie makes my skin shiver, makes me regret having reproductive organs, and makes me feel impure. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothers me about this movie is that they used such a good concept. A creature who fantasizes with disastrous results, instead of the clich√© Worst Nightmare and the exaggerated Twisted Wish, is a truly fascinating movie idea. <br /> <br /> I thought: the reason hobgoblins need to be killed before the day is that they are attracted to bright lights. During the day, bright lights did not show up well so they could go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Count the Hobgoblins: Four hobgoblins leave the movie studio, and still at least nine of the pernicious stuffed animals. toys are killed in the course of the movie. <br /> <br /> Question for discussion: If you had a frigid, demanding and unappreciating girlfriend, would you enter the garden with a military bully? Explain.
