This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island." The sound editing is very bad. You hear the dialogue on set and hear the voices being recorded in a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur movie with actors from Boston and filmed in New Hampshire. For those who live in New Engalnd and anyone reading this review will be amazed at a capital W. This movie is full of flaws. You begin to hear the director's voice giving instructions and giving instructions to the actress. "Okay, now stand up." As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks to your mind instead of your voice and this blue alien. The alien speaks in a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the voice of the actor. As for special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's first job to cry aloud! The creatures are good, but the animation is erratic. Really spasmodic. More or less like the animation of Karl Zeman in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). Special effects are imaginative. The music is good. Bottom line, this movie does EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like an epic from Ray Harryhausen. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoestring budget? One should pay attention to aspiring filmmakers.
