This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It's a curious WW2 movie and serves as a statement about racism. It pays to watch to understand the fact that Movies reflects how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the length of time they depict. Which means that this is a 1970s movie and not a 1940s movie. Still, there are some good action scenes of seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam. The story revolves around the captain knowing that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could be from a Civil War movie and not a WWII movie that reflects on what the movie is. The black lieutenant gives the German women an innocent kiss on the cheek, and the white captain is annoyed. I liked the film from a point of view of curiosity since the stars and the genre were interesting to me.
