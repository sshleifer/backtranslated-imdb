This movie is considered by some as a classic - I have no idea why. It's terrible to the point of being laughable. The only saving grace with this movie is the delivery of cheesy lines that are so curiously embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are some good songs and good choreography in this movie. movie, but SO WHAT! There is no plot, it is set in a theater without change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this movie because he said that I would not believe how a movie can be bad! Was he right. <br /> <br /> Normally, with such a horrible movie, I would recommend that people not watch, but in that case, I think people should, since it will put all the other bad movies that you saw in perspective.
