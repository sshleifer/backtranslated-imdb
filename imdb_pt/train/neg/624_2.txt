The director states in the behind-the-scenes movie that he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the film to Dario Argento, as well as other notable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically, dedicating this movie to these great directors is like giving your mother some shit for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the cast. CASTLE THAT CAN ACT. Also, do not choose a person who is 40 for the role of an incomprehensible inmate of 18 years. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. Reactions made by people when they see their boyfriends have their hearts torn out are fun. Or as a part when a guy is stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha understood), and his girlfriend says, "Oh ... my God?" The scarecrow itself is such a character. Doing turns cars and calling losers. <br /> <br /> The film has a redeeming factor ... ah, wait, no, no. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely MUST see this movie, than just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers everything and has a very rude music face.
