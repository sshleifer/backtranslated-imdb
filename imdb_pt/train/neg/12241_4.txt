This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an undisputed error in his narrative. In dealing with Ralphie's situation, Christopher claims to have heard about Pie-O-My's death in the fire accident. This is an important detail because, in this context, it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the only one who must have killed Ralphie. However, there is no way Chris has heard of the accident. Who should have told him and when? The moment he gets ripped from his delirium by Tony's phone call, no one else has been told. Tony knows this - which makes it even worse! Listening to Christopher talk about Pie-O-My's death could therefore lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself hit the fire. Given the elaborate and elaborate writing process told by the writers themselves on the DVD, I really wonder if none of them noticed the problem there. The story simply does not work that way. Needless to say, I'm a big fan of the Sopranos. Otherwise, I certainly would not mind.
