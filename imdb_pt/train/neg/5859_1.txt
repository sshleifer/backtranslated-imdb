Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in global cinema. They are local and folk but want to be international. This brings kitsch results like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has translated jokes for Turkish Spanish and they have no meaning for the non-Turkish audience. Even for the Turkish public after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players, even Ferhan SENSOY, perform worse than average. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing includes Cuba. Then Cuba is thought of as a republic of bananas. <br /> <br /> Waste of money, waste of time.
