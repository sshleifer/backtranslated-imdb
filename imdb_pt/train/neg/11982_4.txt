In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (as Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (as Lizzie Praskins) supervise the marriage of their children, Anita Page (as Helen) and Norman Foster (as John). Before the celebration, Dressler transforms the reigns of her small town bank into her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bank closures and financial insecurity. Banker Foster is able to survive due to the wise planning of Mother Dressler. But Moran is worried about her fortune and out loud demands a complete withdrawal. Other "Warren Bank" clients hear Moran's speech and begin to question their own solvency. Soon, the family is in financial crisis. <br /> <br /> Dressler's huge success in critics and financial films, "Emma," was released earlier this year, and MGM had to have wanted to release a new Dressler movie as soon as it was released. possible. Dressler's successes in 1931, "Reducing" and "Politics" were still making a lot of money; and Dressler became the No. 1 US box office in 1932, according to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications. "Prosperity" certainly celebrated Dressler's status, but the production seems oddly sloppy and rushed. The cast does well considering. Some more care in directing and editing, and some resumes, would have helped ?? apparently, they needed it in theaters for the holidays. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Poliana Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
