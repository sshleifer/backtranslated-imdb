First of all, I must say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9th grade class and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The film was so disappointing for me. The movie cuts out a few characters and loses many of the book's main points. He jumps a lot and explains nothing in detail. If someone watched this movie without having read the book for the first time, it would be confusing. The most disappointing thing about this movie for me was the ending. The end of the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed! It was supposed to be pigs and men in an alliance and kind of "merging" together, but instead, the film made it seem like the animals would rebel against the pigs. In short, I do not think this film has captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.
