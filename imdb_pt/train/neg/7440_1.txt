I go to the album as the second person who, after years using IMDb to search for movies, was motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned, to create an account and post a comment. This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was on the verge of nonexistence, and none of the "puzzle pieces" added up anyway. The performance was laughable and the writing was embarrassing. How this movie was supported and came to be completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille's insightful and repetitive use of the word f. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this movie again or being attacked by savages, I would be facing a difficult decision. I am disappointed not to be able to give 0 stars.
