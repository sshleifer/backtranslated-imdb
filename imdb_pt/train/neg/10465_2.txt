I really wish I was not writing this review. I am a Christian, so I waited anxiously to see this movie. It sounded great-a Christian movie with some quite famous stars and a plot that looked intriguing (not that I bought the Bible Code itself - you can make it say whatever you want.) But I do believe everything in the Bible ). So I'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews when the movie arrives and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (I would have been shattered by the people applauding the awkward but basically uplifting scenes and panting with the insanely obvious and predictable tension scenes, I'm sure ). Once the final credits started rolling, however, I might reflect. There were many parts of the movie that I liked - a few mostly unexpected twists, some effects that were in fact special (I'm not counting the Visions. Those were poorly made), and some interesting technical work - fades, sets, which kind of thing. Unfortunately, I had the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation for a monkey and put the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could have gotten a better script. And the song went beyond cheesy (even for a Bond fan who likes rather tacky music in action scenes and intrigue). So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like the people who came out crying and out of breath because of how incredible it was - but I'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who plays a few words about a Biblical Shield and beats a Christian seal on it. I need a good plot and a convincing dialogue before I can enjoy most of the movies, and that did not happen either. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And that's the tragedy. When are we going to see some clever Christian fiction? It has to be out there somewhere ...
