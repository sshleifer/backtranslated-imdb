After watching KHAKEE I felt that I will get to watch another good movie but unfortunately The movie is a joke and really trying to present Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is the producer RKS talked a lot about the film during the promotions, saying that the film has different flesh from the films released at that time, I wonder what movie he was talking about. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually a typical Masala movie with lots of comedy, romance, action, all cluttered <br /> <br /> The ease with which children kidnap the family is one of the funniest parts of all time, Imagine children kidnapping Dawood's family <br /> <br /> The end is one complete confusion with sudden change of characterization <RKS gives his weaker film to date, except for some scenes of Bachchan that the film is a boring <br /> The music is boring <br /> <br /> Amitabh tries to play the part of his everything, he does part of it well, though not s I better though he wriggles his face a lot while pulling a trigger and makes a strange look while smoking the cigar H is dubbing is also not matched correctly sometimes Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his acts and fangs <br /> <br /> Aryeman seems unimpressive, tries too much but exaggerates some scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika emerges the best of the lot <br /> <br /> The rest is fine
