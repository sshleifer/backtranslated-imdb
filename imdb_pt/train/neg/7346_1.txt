I feel like I've just been watching a snuff movie ... a beautifully represented, tense, captivating and horrible thing! A litany of two hours of perversion in the most basic and comprehensive sense of the word, sexual violence and torture, rape, decapitation, incest, corruption, live burial and abuse, abuse, abuse. No redemption, whatever. And I was entertained. I could not stop watching. What it says about me, about the people who do and act on that kind of thing, and about a world that has become so desensitized that eventually the actual snuff films will be the norm. And I'm neither puritan nor humorless, I do not try to hide from the existence of darkness, and I definitely did not lead a sheltered life, but I'm ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my British cousins ​​dragging the sewers in the same way as my own tribe. It does not have to be cozy, but does he have to drown in vicarious sadism?
