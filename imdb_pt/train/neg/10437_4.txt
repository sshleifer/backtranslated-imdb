An admirably strange, though malicious, dramatic comedy about a young stranger who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. The quasi-comedy directed by Robert Altman, with eccentric characters, is so overwhelmed with strangers that it begins to squeak at the beginning of the weight. Part of the cinematography is evocative, Shelley Duvall is a point in her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman looks like glamourpuss as Bud Cort's vision of a "mother bird" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her !) In the lead, Bud Cort is - again, after "Harold & Maude" - a true original; Not discouraged like, say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be nerdy, crazy and harmless, a difficult act to do. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's mistakes. He can put together a cast and a play piece like no one but let him get entangled with some misguided inspiration and he leans down. ** in ****
