Good Folks, I stumbled into this movie the night while I was evaluating the roles. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever made the genre the honor it deserves. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I have ever seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version ranks with the Christopher Lambert version. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What I did not like? CGI for one. Surprisingly bad. More important is the fidelity to the plot, not to mention the blistering performance. I'm accustomed to both with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Delighted Regardless, Peter
