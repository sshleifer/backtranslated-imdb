A question for you: A family goes to a new home and is persecuted by demonic forces. What movie am I talking about? Every horror movie you saw? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I will reduce it by saying that there are many scenes of distress for teenagers. Does'nt help? Well there are many bits in which the characters are chased by a creature and you see the characters through the creature's POV. Not good enough? Okay, is there a dream sequence involving a lot of blood? Still it can be any horror movie you say. Oh gawd this could take weeks, so I'll tell the movie that I'm talking about loads loads of Aussies many of which have appeared in NEIGHBORHOODS and HOME AND OUTSIDE. Yes, it is true that the movie is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and you understand what the above exercise is? It's about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely unlike any horror movie that has ever been made
