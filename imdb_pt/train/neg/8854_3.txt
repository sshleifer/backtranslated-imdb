We had STARZ's free weekend and I called the station to see what was going on. It was this movie Howling II: The performance was terrible, but the eye drop was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the eye candy mentioned above. I was laughing a lot at the few scenes I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I never wanted to go to horror movies, if they saw this movie, they would know why. I'd be thrown out for laughing so hard. Just a few curiosities: Reb Brown, who played Ben White, played Captain American in a TV movie. Marsha Brown was Mick Jaggers' inspiration for music. "Brown Sugar" Mick has great taste in women, for sure.
