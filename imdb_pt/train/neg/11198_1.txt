I should not even review this movie, since it's not really a horror movie - and therefore does not deserve the attention of Dr. Cheese. At least, it is not horror in the usual sense. It's certainly a horrible proposition to waste your time watching this crap. That's why I hung up after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, then, when the clock showed that only 45 minutes passed. Yes that's right; in simple terms, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "The Order" had many flaws, not all exclusive. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's unwillingness to engage Christianity on its own terms. It is quite possible to make truly scary films that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, movies like this are just one thing that makes the filmmakers' imaginations (often boring and illogical). <br /> Think about it. If someone made a movie ostensibly about, say, physics, but not only misunderstood the basic laws of physics but based the whole plot on their wrong pictures, you would soon tire of the useless and resultant plot. The same goes for these types of movies. In other words, "The Order" (and many similar films before it) invent whole things about the Catholic Church and the Christian faith and attempt to build a portion of these inventions. Unsurprisingly, the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid. This movie has the charm of being so interesting to see how the toenails grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steaming pile.
