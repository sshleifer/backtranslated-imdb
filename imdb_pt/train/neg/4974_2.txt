May the saints preserve us, because this movie will not help. <br /> <br /> Someone with access needs to email Mel Gibson and say that we need a faithful production of Beowulf. Something that really has something in common with the epic poem that is the basis of all modern Western literature. <br /> <br /> Beowulf's recent (since 2000) versions lead us to question two things. First, why is there so much interest in history? Second, why are all these filmmakers wasting lots of money on this crap? <br /> <br /> The only reason this has two is that the version with Lambert (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed the 1. <br /> What's even worse, some people will watch this and get a misconception about the poem. How can an industry in which Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to film so well can be so wrong. I mean really, the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. <br /> <br /> And, PLEASE, horns on helmets? Spare me. This is insulting. <br /> <br /> hjm
