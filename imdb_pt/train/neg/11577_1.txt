The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the writers try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway (old version) Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the picture as fast as she can (successfully), do not ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to hide their embarrassment with this low quality material. It offers endless dialogue, meaninglessness and very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff, and a beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright mansion. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. Does not do justice to the place.
