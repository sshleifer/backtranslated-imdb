My God, was this the "Run, Lola, Run" adaptation of Persuasion? It was horrible. Bad enough for the "writer" (and I used the term very freely) to cut and paste dialogues from one character to another, often completely out of context and to hasten the story: Anne Elliott running from one place to another in search of Wentworth near the end of the play was an abomination! Austen must be spinning in her grave. No respectable young lady would have acted so horribly. And the actress who played Mary? Horrors Needless to say, if the rest of Austen's remakes are so bad, they will be turning off a new generation of observers. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a flawless version of this wonderful (otherwise) novel, get the Roger Michell-directed version of 1995 starring Amanda Root (whose expressions alone can speak volumes) and Ciaran Hinds. It's superb.
