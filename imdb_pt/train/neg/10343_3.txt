The Golden Age of Disney's drawings was dying in the late 90's. This Quack Pack show should not even be considered a spin-time because the show had almost nothing to do with DuckTales. It's about a teenage Huey, Dewey and Louie as they create problems for their Uncle Donald and speak in hip-hop language and they are fully clothed, unlike DuckTales. I prefer the little adventurous nephews of DuckTales. There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals that live in Duckburg. There is no reference for Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick humor, I recommend this to you. If you want a better Disney show watch "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
