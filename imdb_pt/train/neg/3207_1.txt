Oh my God this was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This movie takes itself very seriously ... unless, of course, they were funny. I saw this last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the whole audience was laughing at all the scenes. I think my favorite was 'you should not be studying medicine at Oopsalof'! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could fill the single line of Nicalo's character 'we'll be together ... it's our destiny.' I'm sorry, but after the first time, the words have lost their meaning. <br /> <br /> And what about the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend this as a lesson to Americans: you can not anime, so please do not try. You're just ashamed.
