This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school who end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye on one of their schoolmates shards and after being scolded for this act they decide to take off for Florida for a vacation. On the way, they meet some guys at a local restaurant and decide that they will meet somewhere later. The girls end up on one side of the road near the forest and stop for some time and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit, she sees a murder happen where the local sheriff himself is involved. She is scared and runs to tell others what happened. The other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them are killed by the killer. Then the two remaining girls are picked up by the killer and placed in the local cell. Meanwhile, the deputy sheriff is watching over the girls and, despite his insistence that the sheriff is the killer, he ignores them and acts like an ignoramus and everyone in this movie, who can not join two or two, let alone a lousy one detective work on what. The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in his cell and it seems that the girl really wants to be raped by this man and the chest scene that I admit was good, but rather his lips meet, he has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the low budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frankie Avalon looking at it, the same reason only a different part of the character. It's not a movie worth renting for a low-budget movie of the '80s and the ending was the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie and left me wanting my money back!
