I'm sorry to say that, but the acting in this movie is awful. The dialogue sounds as if they are reading your lines for the first time. Maybe I got the "dress rehearsal" version by mistake. The director uses excessive slow motion during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is well written, and the fighting sequences are better than I've seen in many action movies. The fights look real enough. But all this happens while, to the two main actors, over and over again miraculously survive incredible amounts of automatic weapons, grenades, warm bullets and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are definitely some of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially when they have the truck on the run at about 30 yards, and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet. These bazookas need a serious calibration of the site.
