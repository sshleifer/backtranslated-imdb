For a comedy writer, Woody Allen really leaves the paying spectator with this meager attempt at character development. There are some fun times but no more than one of them would have to hear their tennis balls drying out. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is wasting his time in this movie that does not show his normally funny delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but again, she did not have room to move in this corpse-like movie. The movie is so heavy and monotonous that it can not be loaded, but if it was loaded, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that happen in a scene and do nothing but show that the writer can write some lines from time to time then you will love movie.
