What the hell was that. Someone obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We have existential anguish mixed with cheap horror. There were times that were disturbing, but each was canceled for horrible music, CGI or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with such weird narratives is that they are lazy. Even the work of David Lynch seems at times, and just like his interesting shows and films, he runs for a long time. And, unfortunately, that's only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive, and that's the limit for that. I suppose this touches the feelings of teenagers and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but it just does not make the characters nice enough to care about their destinies ... whatever they were. The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.
