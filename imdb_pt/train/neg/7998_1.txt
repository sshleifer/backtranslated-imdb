Not only was he invariably annoying to hear, but he had no jokes. I swear, some fucking Asian guy telling jokes about Mom would have been funnier than Leary's crap. (Well, maybe funny for a few minutes, but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Leary claimed that he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" ... apparently he was still on top of something; he was just a perverted asshole, mostly drug-related. One of his jokes was something like: 'I would not use crack, especially with the same name as between my butt' - Oh man, how did he come up with that? I swear the only guy who needs to shut up is Denis Leary. Thank God I did not have to see him live. This guy sucks. <br /> <br /> If you have fun with the swear word and the "jokes" you might come across, waste your time on this junk.
