Anyone who has seen Child Eaters of Tammuz knows that this is a director who can do better. Let's hope it's not a case of too many hands in the pot (Telefilm, anyone?) And that's a case of second-rate nervousness. Characters are one-dimensional and overused. The scenery is fantastic and shows the Pacific Northwest beautifully. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. Filmed almost entirely from the outside, the images are crisp and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is as good as it looks - only one heart is missing.
