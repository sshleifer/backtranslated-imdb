This is a really horrible B movie. It is bland and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic routine of "doing business of show business," is almost non-existent. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups from 1942, including the Mills brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group gets about three minutes, with the exception of the Mills Brothers, who for some reason have secured two numbers. Ann Miller can not dance until the last minutes of the movie, and she has little to do but flaunt her stuff amid a flurry of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment of the film, in my opinion, occurred in the Duke Ellington segment. The band seems to be playing on a train, in difficult positions. (At the southern end of the season, the band was segregated into wagons when traveling.) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke, and Harry Carney can also be identified. In the last moments of the film, trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance runs the ship into the camera and makes an "Uncle Tom", bothering his eyes and shaking his head the way Willy Best has done in many movies. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this tribute to segregation is really sad. Some movies look better invisible.
