A collection of deleted scenes and alternate captions, edited together and added with voice to make it appear to occur after the events of the first. Very cool idea, but the deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof. As it's not as funny as "Anchorman", and we'll actually admit that the film was not exactly comedy either, so you have a worse movie than one that was moderately funny. In my eyes it still places one or two steps above "Kicking and Screaming," or "Bewitched." Chross his fingers that "The Wedding Crashers" is a return to old school form (no pun intended) <br /> <br /> My Note: D
