I've tried removing anything that might be considered a spoiler. I also assume that you have seen the first movie or at least know the general essence, so if you do not have some of it it may not make sense. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: This movie beats the audience throughout the film. head with tired philosophical phrases again and again in an attempt to convey the theme. We are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose, fate and choice, and forced to endure the long and tortured platitude sessions that contain them. <br /> <br /> Neo, awakened from a dream in the last film, now begins a period of realization about his very existence. There are so many revelations in this movie that I'm going to be lazy so they do not look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you are still worried, vague references will ruin the film, do not read the paragraph below. <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of faith are revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed. The interdependence of human beings and technology and our faith in technology are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining other things that are revealed would go into so much detail, so I will abstain (as the guidelines for writing a commentary ask). Btw, by "revealed" I mean, I hit our ears and eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Plot: So how does Neo and his gang go from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next? In short, they keep the faith, use and abuse of overly stylized actions and bullet time as if it were going out of fashion (and after that exhibition, I hope moviegoers will learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a little more) . More on that later. In order not to ruin anything, I'll say no more than the promotional material already made: Neo is still trying to find out the Matrix, and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans, and Zion, while the villains are chasing him and his cohorts. The film practically picks up where the last one stopped. <br /> <br /> Action: While the martial arts action and shootings peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts, this film focuses much more on martial arts than shootings, adding spades, salts, etc. to the mix. Special effects are so worn and waved on the public's face that it becomes really tiring. I discussed this movie with friends and co-workers, and most of them found some of the action sequences - especially the "Smith fight" we all heard it would be in the movie - to be very long and tedious. This is a huge red flag for action fans because the end of an action sequence should leave you wanting a little more, or completely satisfied with the grandiosity that just happened. <br /> <br /> These fight scenes do not. They are exaggerated and stylized sequences that are wooden and uninspired. In the first film, there was a real sense of desperation in part of the action, a feeling that the fight was for survival, not just good-looking (which I honestly do not think they get in Reloaded anyway) in black and leather. Go watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remember what good sequences of fights are - you will not regret it. In addition, the "matrix skills" that people have in Reloaded are not consistent and what they actually do is not consistent. The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they were not very obvious - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are dumped non-stop. Every little thing anyone does, whether it's just jumping, somersaulting, spinning, and in many cases just posing, is slow, accelerated, or overly accentuated by some kind of destruction. Clearly the WBros had a ton of money to play in this movie, and the boy played it with no real restraint. Sharp's editors could have really helped this, but the first film was such a success that the free reign was obviously given, which brings us to that. . Character and dialogue: I have already said, more or less, that the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical clich√©s. Actors can not really bring much depth to your character when the script and direction are pushing the character's face of character progression, or neglecting it completely. The audience is never given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own. <br /> <br /> Keanu's acting performance is tough at best. Keanu is good at acting confused, and it's about everything he does in this movie. He makes a decent attempt to show passion between Neo and Trinity, but falls flat. Lawrence tries to make everything Morpheus from Moses to Henry V, and be as cool as a cat everywhere. With the script he's provided, he makes a noble attempt but also falls. <br /> <br /> Moss is also not very believable. His look of concern is always the same, much like Keanu's, and the chemistry is not there, although in his very physical scenes they do well enough. <br /> <br /> Hugo once again brought his strange feeling of being an agent program, but he also suffered with the script's hand. In fact, I think he's the most interesting character in the group, but instead of developing, they just make him an excuse for a huge fighting scene. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is beyond disappointing. if you had good expectations, and on your own, like an independent movie (which is not how it should be taken), it's still horrible. I do not see the Matrix so deep, but at least I see it as a nice science fiction joke that has some interesting ideas, good deed, some funny lines and a lot of symbolism and illusions contained to amuse the attentive. Reloaded fails on all these points, and I really hope the W Bros gives us a better experience on the 3rd installment. I do not have much hope for that after this movie.
