**** ATTENTION: here are spoilers **** Why do I waste my years running hastily seeing garbage like this? This film is an impressive collection of clich√©s, poor writing, poor direction, and so we have not gotten to the acting yet. <br /> <br /> And, of course, you can predict the whole story from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The hero specialist fights stupid, corrupt, and incompetent henchmen. An avalanche ends, burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive, despite going through all kinds of cliffhanger perils. Corrupt partner that caused the whole thing gets fried alive along with your reward money. Second avalanche heroically deflected by the adventurous experiment of the renegade specialist. Bad capangas in the end end up having a heart too. Disturbed teenager falls into the arms of her crunchy stepmother after being saved by her. Etc, etc, etc, etc, and so on. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are few reasons to warn about spoilers. You could probably work the whole plot if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, I was not far from the target most of the time, anticipating what would happen next. <br /> <br /> And then we do not discuss factual errors. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous commenter that although there are usually some redeeming features, even from a bad movie. you would be hard pressed to find any in this. I suppose I gave 2 out of 10 for some nice scenes, but that's all. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since a movie made me moan, but it certainly worked.
