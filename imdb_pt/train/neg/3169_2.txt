This movie is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has some talent and the only one who is not boring. I've never watched Despensa Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is at this show, but in this movie she was horrible. It's like she does not know anything about acting. All she does is complain throughout the movie, and she can not be a b **** and still be fun. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion and it's as if you're looking at the suggestion cards as you read them. <br /> <br /> As for history, it's so cookie cutter. It goes from point A to point B with little surprise. Much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit. <br /> <br /> FINAL TRUTH: Not worth watching.
