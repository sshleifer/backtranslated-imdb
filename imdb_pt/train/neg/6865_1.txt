This movie was so bad it was laughable. I could not resist watching him though. The plot is standard, the acting pretty horrible (support cast, like crazy neighbor and friend lawyer, were better actors). It's funny if you have some time to lose and like to see the conclusion of a dramatic plot. The headliner who plays "Kathy" was simply fascinating, because I could not decide if its unimpressive impact was the result of a bad surgery or simply bad acting (I decided it was both). This leaves the script to comment on, which was pretty awful. Pat remarks, stupid decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of all the characters in the movie. Maybe that's what was so fascinating; I do not know. I just watched to see how bad it could be. (Actually, the dialogue does not even qualify to be called a "clich√©" - but it's almost completely futile). <br /> <br /> All in all, very bad and cheap movie. The sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) have been shown repeatedly without art or real connection to the action; more like props that were randomly discarded in the action in a bad move. A chase scene could have been made by any juvenile in a warehouse or old school: failed shot, cheap props, minimal action ... and I still wanted to see the ending. Who knows.
