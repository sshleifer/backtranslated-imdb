This is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the West Indies and is starring Puddy from the show "Seinfeld"! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this planned film and he is noticeably leaner here. Oliver Reed was at the top of the bill, but he's hardly in the movie. Warburton plays a white slave and it's funny to see all the young and excited wives of rich old men offering it because everyone wants to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays a brothel owner and they are so nudity in the movie. If they are not drunken orgies at the brothel, then it is the young wives who turn to him. Then it is clear that in the end the slaves revolt and there is the bloody stalemate. No real political message like the movie "Burn", but just another gimmick planned to carry the story forward. Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and the rest of the cast returned! I hope you have made a lot of money because this first movie is very bad. Nudity keeps her watchful and Warburton's lack of accent makes her laughable at times. Very bad movie, but I have to admit I want to see the sequel.
