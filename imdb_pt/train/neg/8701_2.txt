This is probably one of the worst "I want to be a low budget film" to credit the genre of dinosaurs. The film is so predictable that you can leave, cook dinner, answer the phone or whatever, and when you come back, you'll know exactly what happened. The special effects are so bad that you would think Lego bricks were used and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator. The performance is over. They try so hard, but there simply are not enough characters behind them to get into the characters and as for the scientist ... Yes, we know exactly what will happen to the blonde girl with glasses. Stereotypes was created for movies like this. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you not be in a serious mood as the cast and crew obviously were. And if you really like dinosaurs and know everything about them, do not watch, you can break the screen - the facts are so far apart.
