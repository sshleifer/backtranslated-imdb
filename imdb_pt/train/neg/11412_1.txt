This movie is so bad you can not imagine it. The acting is terrible, even worse than in the third-class soap operas. It's a shame that this movie has been the most successful in the last 20 years in Switzerland. The interactions between the soldiers made no sense at all. The story could have been drawn from a photo story, the dialogues were as wood as the Treebeard and the holes in the plot were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But nowadays it does not need much to satisfy the public. The actors were beautiful, for example the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hanged (woah !!) and certainly there was a lot of drug abuse. That's really cool, man! Particularly for adolescents 12 and 13 years old. But the media created an atmosphere in which you were not allowed to reject the movie because they manipulated the dynamics of the group of colleagues, implicitly saying that you are a nerd if you do not agree with the other "sheep" and say yes. Exactly what it was like when I was in the army / that's exactly what I'm going to do when I'm supposed to go to the military ... for all tacky action that has to do with drugs and coolness. And do not think I like the army. I was there and hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning the sticky bathroom with a toothbrush (which I was forced to do because I offended a lieutenant). It is not necessary for each film to be sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to have fun for a few hours and forget the problems and I think that's not a bad thing. But this kind of film influences teenagers a lot, showing them a cool lifestyle that is actually just stupid and turns them into ignorant, self-centered idiots with no brain. But since I now that my opinion is not very popular I will be quiet now and recommend that you avoid this terrible movie at any cost and for this to spare your wits! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my lousy English)
