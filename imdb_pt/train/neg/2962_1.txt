Dinosaur movies can be fun. The same goes for the films of Whoopi Goldberg. But whoopi and dinosaurs? After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex," I came to the conclusion: this movie is evil. Evil, vile, wicked and reprehensible in his spite for the public. Nothing so bad is done by accident; This is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi does not make good action movies (watch "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the filmmakers do not do that. t care - she's a tough cop here again. <br /> <br /> Seen millions of police friends this week? Well, here's number one and one, my friend. <br /> <br /> Do not like animated and humanistic dinosaurs since Spielberg's TV show about them? Too bad, here's another one and he's a cop, too! <br /> <br /> You are one of those people who hates car chases, shootings, sloppy dialogues, boring futuristic FX and see talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write- Off? A GREAT fiscal agreement? <br /> <br /> And you read this review to the end. You deserve a sequel. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No star, not one. And if they actually make a sequel to "Theodore Rex," Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a flock of rubber-foam dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Now, I would pay to see this.
