The second in the holiday series is easily the least enjoyable, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family to Europe. <br /> <br /> The tasteless, below-the-belt humor that worked so well the first time is virtually nonexistent here. This flaw certainly belongs to director Hackerling, who is obviously a director as good as Harold Ramis and an uninspiring script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around. The cast does what it can; Chevy Chase injects some form of life into the process but simply is not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments are not brought to their full potential and leave the spectator aggravated. All representations of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not funny (as the English are very educated). <br /> <br /> In addition to some scenes, there is almost no laughter in sight and the ending becomes something. one in complete clowning. But if you're a fan of Chevy Chase (like me) the film is watchable, but no more than that.
