This initial Adam Sandler movie could be likened to his life as a comedian during the same period in 1989. His character's constant recognition of his hidden comic genius and frustration over humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than from the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster movies, such as Big Daddy or even the horn Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself consistently, successfully, and funny when this film was made, as well as his character. Most of the "jokes" in the film come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually about unrecognized comedic talent and beating himself because he is very ugly and can not get women. The film is difficult to watch too because it is not treated like a real movie. Sandler talks to the camera and viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is unpleasant and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I even saw this movie after it was over, for fear that, if it found out, it would ruin Sandler's career. I checked into the video store, rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
