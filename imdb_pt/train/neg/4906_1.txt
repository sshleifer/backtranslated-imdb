Well, I do not know where to start. Obviously this was a made for the TV movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised at the general direction of the second hour, but anything before or after that seemed to be a movie-type painting in numbers. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry among the agapornis detectives. .. <br /> <br /> I would go deeper, but this movie really does not deserve it. Note: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
