Unfortunately, the only spoiler of this review is that there is nothing to spoil about the movie. Even if B. Mattei had never done any masterwork, he used to do his job with a bit of humor and madness that made him a fun director of Eurotrash. But in the last 10 years he seemed to have lost. This movie is empty, nothing to wake us from the deep sleep you dive after the first 10 min. No sex, no blood (it's supposed to be about snuff?), No actors, no dialogues, as bad as a 90'TV movie. It's even worse than your last cannibals and epic zombies. To rest in peace Bruno, you go stay in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as: Zombie 3, Robowar, Mice, Hell Mourning, Viruses, Cruel Jaws and a few others. So, unless you want to see B Mattei owned by the new spirit movie by jess Franco, pass this one here. But if you do not know the career of this nice craftsman down your old movies and have fun.
