The brain that would not die is a horrible movie that stinks from the opening credits. It has all the classic signs of being bad: unbelievable plot, terrible acting, low quality ensembles and lighting. The plot is like this: when a doctor and his fiancee are caught in an accident, she is beheaded and he takes her head and takes her to the lab, where he puts his head in a pan with a special liquid that keeps her alive. I bet Virgnina Leath, who threw her head into a pot, had to spend a lot of time uncomfortable using that pan around her neck and crouched under a table. Anyway, the doctor then tries to find a new body for her and hires two strippers so she can choose one to have her new body. Bad all the time, so bad it was ripped to shreds at the Mystery Science Theater 3000.
