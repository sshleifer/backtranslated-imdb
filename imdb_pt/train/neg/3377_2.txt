The Broadway musical, "A Chorus Line", is arguably the best theater musical. It's about the experiences of people who live to dance; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer is auditioning for parts on a Broadway choir line, but what comes out of each is stories of how their lives led them to find the dance as a pause. The film version, however, does not capture anything of the passion or beauty of the show, and is undoubtedly the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical, since it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for the dance. whatever it is. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake was made in giving the director's work to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose direction offered only the right touch and rhythm to "Gandhi." Why would anyone in their right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that happened in a reasonably restricted place? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "The Chorus Line" takes place on the stage of a theater without real sets and limited clothing changes. It is the least flashy of Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, this does not translate well into movies, and no one really thought it would be like this. For that reason, the film should have taken us into the lives of these dancers, and should have gotten out of the process of theater and audition. The singers could have offered their music in other venues and even offered flashbacks for their first ballet, jazz or tap dance class. Heck, they could have danced on Broadway in their animated imaginations. However, no fragment of imagination entered the production of this film, since Attenborough's total indifference to dance and the show itself is evident in its indifferent direction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are frankly strange, as the dancers count. story for the director (Michael Douglas) whether he wants to hear them or not. Douglas's character is capricious about choosing whom he extends a sympathetic ear, and for whom he has no patience. <br /> <br /> While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. The beautiful "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love" - ​​a dizzying number that took the dancers back into their teens - was removed and replaced by the terrible "Surprise", a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar. Adding insult to injury, "Surprise" simply recounted the same story as "Hello, Love," but without the wit or pathos. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see this movie unless you want a lesson on what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to the movies. If you want to see a movie version of this program, the next next thing is Bob Fosse's brilliant "All That Jazz." While the daughter of Fosse is in "A Chorus Line", HE is the Fosse that should be involved like director. He would know what to do with this material, which deserved much more respect than this sad effort.
