When I learned that the Dukes of Hazzard would be redone with current actors and a solid script, I was like, "Okay, I'll give it a try, it will not be better than the first, but we'll see what happens." I saw what happened. I saw a great 70's / 80's show that was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood. It's so sad to see that Hollywood writers can not come up with anything original these days. They are looking to have a great show that had a large audience, and try to "remake" the classic show. Hollywood arrives ... IT IS NOT WORKING !!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they might have picked a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of. Also, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. How low can you go ?? An idiotic and stupid actor to play the lovely Luke. It makes me sick. Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, stubborn and a good girl from southern IL. She was every little girl model growing up! (I owned the doll and the Jeep - thank you !!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson threw a clever butt, 2 bit bitch like Daisy Duke. Daisy has never been blonde. Why did they have to launch it? Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great southern accent and she is beautiful, and she would have done a wonderful job. Anyway, I would say that this movie burst something fierce. I feel like I was robbed by paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and they should refund my money. If you like Dukes of Hazzard (the original series) do not see this movie. This will only upset you. The CMT (country music television) plays the reruns of the Dukes all the time at night. So set your TIVO and go with the real thing, not imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
