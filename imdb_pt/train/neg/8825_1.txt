The only reason to give this movie a single star is how much the ending made me laugh. I had high hopes, since I usually love bad horror movies, but that does not qualify. It's really just a poor attempt to show a character slowly slipping into insanity, which, again, is not a bad plot but is done poorly here. There are some scenes (like the ending), which are not meant to be funny, but really made me laugh out loud. There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would really go in an interesting direction, but it never fulfills what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you're looking for a Christmas horror movie, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
