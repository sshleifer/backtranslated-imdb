So I've heard from some people that this movie has brought them to tears in the theater. While watching for the first time, I was expecting another romantic and barbarian film from Barbra Streisand; Something like the way we were. I was certainly wrong. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, was non-existent, making it impossible to cling to the characters. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's character fell to an alcoholic drug addict who could not sing a single note without making me want to press the fast-forward button. At one point your character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about a rock star and a woman who seems not to notice until he actually dies. Parts of the movie seemed to drag on indefinitely, and I kept wondering when that was going to end. <br /> <br /> John Howard's death was completely predictable. There was an obvious anticipation of his reckless behavior at the beginning of the movie, and when he died I did not feel any emotion. It was not a tragic accident, basically he was an idiot. Not to mention throughout the film that I was distracted by his hideous beard. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this movie that are worth seeing are Streisand's songs. The end of the movie, when she sings "With One More Look At You / Watch Near Now", was my reason for giving this movie a whopping 3/10. Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I really felt a different excitement of irritation and anger.
