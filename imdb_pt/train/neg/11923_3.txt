An illegal immigrant resists the social support system, causing terrible consequences for many. Well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced, yet the slow pace really triggers the conclusion. The feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed. The little lost person in the big society is something we can all relate to, but I can not endorse getting out of your way to see this movie.
