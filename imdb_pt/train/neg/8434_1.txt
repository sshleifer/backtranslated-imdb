This movie showed more racial hatred to the Jews by David Mamet than I have ever encountered in an American movie. The stereotypes are so exaggerated that my ability to continue watching is dead. I was so disappointed in Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna calling a group of men, sitting in a jewish center of New York, cleaning guns, heroes that common sense prevailed and I stopped. I am deeply disturbed by the concept that Jews are not American and "different." I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred and not a healer of it.
