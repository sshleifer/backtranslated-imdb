This is not a bad movie ... but it's the kind your girlfriend makes you watch. The story is not bad ... it only makes the hour and a half seem so long. It's hard for me to ruin this movie because I really like the idea of ​​it, but it was only for long and thin story ... too bad. The main character never seems to change much from beginning to end. I mean it goes through something "change of life" and he can barely break a smile. I really thought the Mac was really good. His weird oddity prevented the film from being a complete disaster. Maybe I just do not "get" this movie. If anyone can explain it to me, I'd love to be informed.
