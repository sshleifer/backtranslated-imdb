I found this on the shelf while houseitting and bored. How can people give a 10? It's not just the supposed rescue movie (I think), because it also does not work on that level. Bad plot, bad dialogue, terrible acting; there is nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent but has nothing to work on, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are terrible. The progression of the plot (especially the relation between Byron and Ashley) does not make sense. It seems that the writers wanted the plot to follow a certain path and do so without writing down the bits needed to make it flow. It's only an hour and a half, but it's 90 minutes of your life that you will never get back.
