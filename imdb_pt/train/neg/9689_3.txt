In one respect, it's like "The Wizard of Oz," with Paris in black and white and Riviera in color. But it's supposed to be about possessive love, destructiveness, and moral decadence, while it's really about designer dresses, Riveria photos, lots of expensive cars and interludes of music and dance suggested by Vincente Minnelli on one of his days off. Watchable but a remarkable example of desperate, dark plot material and flashy style going in opposite directions. (Was this the model for 'The Talented Mister Ripley? Does anyone feel an affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
