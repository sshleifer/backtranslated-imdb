Over time they released this movie on DVD. I know some say WB accelerate the release of this movie because of the movie The Dreamgirls. But how can you rush the release of a movie that has been in its catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this film, no special feature, no 5.1 DD sound. Come on WB, you can do much better than that. The audio and image quality in this film needs serious help. <br /> <br /> It seems that WB has not given so much time and attention to this film because it is a black movie and I have good sales. They could have kept the CD which by the way does not have all the songs on the original CD. <br /> <br /> I recommend this DVD for purchase. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB needs to add some more special feature. Take notes of other group films, The Five Heatbeats, or The Temptation where you can see just the performance, and the sound in both is much, much, much better than this DVD.
