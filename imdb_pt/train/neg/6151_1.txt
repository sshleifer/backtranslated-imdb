... and by no means clean, logical and understandable as in the photo of that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood cliches. I am 27 years old and have spent 16 years of my life. life struggling with delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. As the main character in the film, I was successful mainly because of the logic: because I kept thinking several times to keep the illusion away from reality, and to know what was really happening and what was not. In the end I was very successful because of the medication, by the way, but I certainly escaped the madness because I knew before taking the medication the difference between what was real and what was not. <br /> <br /> So, I have the right to say that this movie is a total fraud. Not only did he cheat on the story of the main character (who was not faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but mostly, it shows a comforting view of schizophrenia - which is totally wrong. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a mental structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic * is not a "normal man with an illness", is someone who from an early age sees and feels things differently from most people: for him, things like time, space and personality of people are not solid. He feels he can be bent, can change, can mutate, and even disappear. To deal with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, imaginative inner world that "normal" people do not expect - but he's stuck because he can not relate to most people, and his world gets worse and worse until he's done in an illusory dead end, blank. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is portrayed in this ridiculous "cure" movie. It must be frighteningly scary. People other than the main character must seem strange, strange and absurd, as in Lynch's "Eraserhead", for example. There must be * really * impressive, strange, and gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is about. It's not about * details *. I mean, watch "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read PK Dick "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", DO watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City, "or play" American McGee's Alice "on the PC, and you may have a vague idea of ​​what it's like. Do not watch the "feel good" movie of the month, with mundane situations, characters and clean visuals and stupid tricks. "The Cell" is the most accurate film about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions and his inner consistency - it is violent, strange, confusing and very, very scary. <br /> <br /> Again, schizophrenia is not about details, it's not a tame trick for you. He jumps in your face and will not let you go: walls crumble, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you're back in time, you're not sure who you are who you think you are, it all seems. .. strange, not natural. Believe me, this is much more than what is shown in this soap melodrama
