Here's one that you can watch with a serious face, with such a bad script, even Will Ferrell would not be in it. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1 The Punch-Dance. Rod "needs to go to his quiet place" and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is walking with passion a bodyswerve passionate about the strings of a band that wishes to have the faux metal chops from Europe. <BR> <BR> You are the voice of John Farnham. In one of those epic sequences in which the star and his companions make the Slomo Walk down Main Street and the villagers follow on their heels in support, the soundtrack is the joke. How did the filmmakers come across this Australian artist? A great Australian vocalist (and a genuine talent) who gained fame in the early 1970s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin 'On My Head, and disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You The Voice, John Farnham's anthem is so ugly , leveled mountains in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two highlights in the film - both spoiled anyway with careless writing - the rest of the film is like choking on someone else's vomit. <br /> <Andy Samberg is Rod, an acrobat jumper who has never jumped. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he's driving a moped in the heart of the dark. Or his fake mustache. Yeh, someone really thought it was funny. Without a leap under his star belt, he plans an extravaganza of 15 buses - which would surely kill a bad little comedian such as Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and, at the same time, end cancer and whatever ... who watches these films by plot? Along the way (as usual for idiot leads in these comedies), he punctuates a wholesome girl (Isla Fisher), who certainly must be retarded to consider trading chromosomes with that loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost phoned her performance - then changed her mind and hung up. Ian McShane must have lost a bet to be here.
