I gave this movie loooooooooooooooo a "2" because of the attractive actors and semi-sexy love scenes. Otherwise, if you can not read as a speed reader, you will NEVER go through the subtitles that try to keep up with the Spanish speaking speed! And what the heck is going on in the plot if you can not read the subtitles. Endless looks and stares and constant rejection. Just annoying after an hour or so. Some good cinematography, but also some so dark that you think your screen is exhausted. How it has gained something that I will never understand. Difficult to talk about "ACTING", since the main actors seem to just look and gaze lovingly at one another when they are not moving away from each other. The character Geraldo is so attractive that it is hard to believe that NOBODY takes him away. And what about his mother? I just did not GET IT most of the time except that there were three guys who all seem to have had a story with each other .... but I never found out who was "EX".
