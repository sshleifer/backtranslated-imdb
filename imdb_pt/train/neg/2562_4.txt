Let me start by saying that this movie has a funny point at the beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: Huh? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: Me the new George. Studio very cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the part? George: New George just lucky, I guess. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's the only funny part in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still fun ... But again, I have fun easily <br /> <br /> I would not say this is the worst movie I've ever seen (this title goes for the terribly unfunny Disaster movie ...), This movie falls into 7th place on my list of the lowest 15 ... <br /> <br /> If you are a small child who has fun easily, you will enjoy of this film. If you are a movie watcher who wants a good and funny movie, you will end up killing yourself in the middle of it.
