this movie was as gay as if it were a mother and a cat who have sex, they are also afraid of kittens. they are set afire by them. the alien thing of the mother cat kills a guy stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn? they are bulletproof. invisible. and what not. the star of the movie, Clovis, is the cops' cat, Clovis leads the cops to find the alien mother, and after the mother kills the cops, Clovis kills his mother by eating her head, so she catches fire. This movie sucks. It was a lot funnier than scary, not scary at all. the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera, he dominates it. she then goes and hugs her. then he grabs her and begins to rape her. once again, Clovis comes to the rescue
