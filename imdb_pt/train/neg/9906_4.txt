After reading the reviews, it became obvious that everyone was intellectualizing this work. How utterly annoying. Oh how about the good old days and there was nothing like it. Of all the comments, no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other. <br /> <br /> I grew up just after the end of the steamy era and this cinematic gem along with Dan'l Boone graced the Saturday afternoon matinees. . This was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with chatter, barking, farting, laughing, monsters like me or myself. And it was a movie movie at the time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. The IMDb insists that every review contains something about the plot. Trouble was, he was a role model. Here goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and defeats these evil people. Alive! <br /> <br /> All of us children discover the plot before we set up our room to watch. That was just about the plot of all the Scott films, John Wayne and Roy Rogers ever made. If you take the time to go back and review each movie - just do not ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> You have to remember the context of the times. There was not much TV. None for children. There was school. There was great outdoors. There were toy guns. No cyber time. And the steam age had just collapsed. But movies like this provided entertainment and filled the imagination of young Whippersnappers. Even the girls got into it. <br /> <br /> This movie was the entertainment. And it's as unconscious as anything produced today. It had a purpose originally to be propaganda. But they quickly came to be children's films. <br /> <br /> Our parents had experienced the real thing. And it would not be until Sam Peckinpah, a decade later, that red imitation blood splatters finally appear in realistic, abundant quantities. Not until his direction did someone die slowly, with much pain and miserably. Until the Peckinpah war and the arms fights were a rather bloodless affair. Thank you Sam. <br /> <br /> To see a movie had little or no blood, the adults did not care. They would not have tolerated this, I guess. There is no courage to spray the life of plants. So this movie had all the glory and nothing bloody. Gung Ho was child friendly then. <br /> <br /> You will see that I assigned a four to this rating. Why would I do that? It's a terrible movie. No matter how I love it. I love this movie because it brought back one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But it's not that good of a movie in terms of quality. Basically, Gung Ho transited to become a children's novel. <br /> <br /> People should watch it. Clear. I'm not saying to stay away. Realistically, though. The plot is simple. The shallow characters? they are shoals. You can love a bad movie.
