It was a painful experience, the whole story is really there, so I'm not going to get into it, but the acting was horrible, there's that part in the beginning, when the scientist brother goes to work, he actually wears a white lab coat at home before leaving. to work, I thought working with biohazard material meant you should wear sterile clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab. There is a monitor on top of a file that has nothing to do with the whole scene. to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a jar labeled with biological risk and his boss intrudes him and does not even tell him anything about it ... he did not mention bad acting too bad it can not get worse than my advice does not watch and I thought nothing could be worse than the house of the dead, apparently the Uwi Boll movies look like classic Shakespeare compared to this!
