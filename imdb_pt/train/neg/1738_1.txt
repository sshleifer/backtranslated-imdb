This miserable movie is a remake of a 1927 movie. They should have let it stay that way. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks shows absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is submitted to a role as a real idiot and Bette Grable sings with a chorus - What I'm Gonna Do With It Hungarian! <br /> <br /> The ridiculous plot deals with a photo of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome who saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now, let's move on to 300 years later, where Grable, married to Count Romero, faces a similar situation when on their wedding night there is an invasion of Hungarian soldiers. <br /> <br /> Romero acts cowardly and runs away before the army arrives. He disguises himself as a gypsy and is obliged to remain in the castle when his violin plays pleases Fairbanks. The ending is worse than the whole miserable movie when Grable meets with Fairbanks to tell him the good news - an enraged Romero nullified the marriage. <br /> <br /> This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. Like Harry Davenport, a veteran support player who is in it, he died in 1949; this must have been his last film. What a pump to leave after such a distinguished career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel is co-starring but little can do with such poor writing. The costumes look more like those that would come out of stone age. I can not understand what Fairbanks was wearing.
