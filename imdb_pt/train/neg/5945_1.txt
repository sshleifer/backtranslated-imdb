A black guy fights ..... and supposedly wins .... yeah ... 1/10. Obviously fiction. <br /> <br /> So we are presented with a great title, a really cool slogan and even a legal plot. It's about that, that's where it ends ... We turn to fiction after Michael Jai White, the black guy, so do not get confused by the name .. it portrays a black guy .. Umm, that's all there is to the name .. <br /> <br /> It is so difficult to find decent help, must have engaged the black guys friends to help cause the low budget, low unfitness of this film, has the shadow of the camera dragging the first scenes .... idiot obvious to the average guy like you and me .. but yeah ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. review submitted. If you paid to see this movie, you screwed up.
