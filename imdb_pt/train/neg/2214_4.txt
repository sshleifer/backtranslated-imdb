this movie was not atrocious at all, but it was very bad. the acting really was very good! Jeffrey's pigeons did a very good job as the mad scientist, which is kind of their specialty if you do not know such things: D. bill forsythe .. well, I'm not exactly sure why he was in this movie. He's too good for that sort of thing, and his role was not exactly picky. I rented this with the strength of these two tracks and was not disappointed. I mean, it's a half-man / half-shark movie. It is not Shakespeare's personal. Besides the plot, which is full of holes, and poor dialogue, I would like to note that cinematography has also left many things to be desired. there were shots they were trying to look "cool" but they ended up obscuring the scene or just coming out of a simple cheezy. They also exploded many times when they had a decent dialogue and cut prematurely before the person could deliver the line. it was really bad. but if you are a jeffrey combs fan, it is worth checking out this one. he does a great performance and does what he can with the character. forsythe is not bad either, and it is also the female lead. Heck if I can remember her name though. Bottom line, I would not waste your time.
