DEAD HUSBANDS is a rather silly comedy about a bunch of wives who conspire to kill each other's husbands. It's by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies I could mention, but it never compromises its potential. Imagine how good that would be if we had the Farrelly brothers directing Ben Stiller as Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Oh, Carter is based on Jerry Springer? Just curious why the phrase in Dr. Elson's program is "take care of each other and keep talking"
