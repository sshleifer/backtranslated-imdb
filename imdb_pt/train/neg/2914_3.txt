The above title is used to present the movie "Gen" to your audience. Gen is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The movie begins with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While she drives, we realize she is not as close to home as the hospital is in a remote area. As she enters the hospital garden, she sees the body of a patient's death. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers arrive at the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut due to poor weather conditions. All your communication with the outside world is also cut off. There is no escape! In those few days, there will be more unpleasant murders. Now everyone is suspicious of each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been really scary. There are positive sides to the film, of course. I really like the beginning of the movie. Especially when she drives to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. Actings are fine. Some of them are trying very hard to be mysterious and scary though. I think the final shock should have been scattered throughout the film. What I'm saying is that it was a good turnaround, but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realized it was coming when we see what is happening. The director needed to explain it completely, which I think did not work well. Also the most dangerous patient in the movie must be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure he'll get better. This is your first attempt. I recently discovered that he is only 21 years old. It made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I'm not going to rate this movie though.
