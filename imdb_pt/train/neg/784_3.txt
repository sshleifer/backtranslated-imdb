Despite positive reviews and exhibitions at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other films, in which a teenager from the immigrant family needs to overcome many common problems. problems of his age, and also to fight against the pressure of ethnic traditions in his family. She does this by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy who for some reason falls in love with her, she faces her problems and wins. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight's boxing, in Bend as Beckham is football, and now it's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But the Fighter is a far inferior product to these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, the "actress" who plays the role of a teenager, may be able to do many things, but one thing she can not do is act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and awkward, the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions, are terrible, her body and facial language are amateur actress, poorly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a bit better, but they just can not save this clich√© movie with stereotypical characters and superficial plot. In addition to a few relatively good moments, this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer. <br /> <br /> Even the kung fu fight is not a reason to watch it, it's so annoying. Slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and uninspired, and most kung fu scenes are only trained or standing in all sorts of kung fu positions, not actually struggling. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small, skinny girl struggles with big, muscular boys and knocks them down. <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie was noticed is because it is European. It's very easy to spread this film - A first Danish martial arts film, but make no mistake, it's not. It's just a drama about a stupid teenager and her problems, which, by the way, are not really convincing. <br /> <br /> Bad movie with embarrassing traits, acting and history.
