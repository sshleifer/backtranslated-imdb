I bought Unhinged because I was sucked by the bloody image on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. All the killings are shown and I can honestly say they look much better in the frames than in the movie. <br /> <br /> That said, let's look at the plot. A group of college girls heading for a rock show (through a deep, dark grove in one of the longest driving sequences captured on celluloid) gets off the road. No visible damage is done to the car, but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a coma for the rest of the movie (or maybe she read the script and was already in a coma before filming started). <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The two remaining girls wake up in a large, secluded home. The house, by the way, is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the movie. For some reason, however, this house has no roads for that. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five miles through the woods. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged sitting listening to strange conversations between a rich old whore (who looks like George Washington in the drag) and her equally homely and sexually repressed daughter. The girls apparently were in no hurry to return from that gig, as they packed more clothes than the Gilligan's Island cast for their three-hour tour. <br /> <br /> When we, the spectators, arrive at the kill scenes, we do not care anymore. We want someone to kill us just to end our suffering. Unhinged finally ends with a very shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better movie. It's almost as if the ending, the only good idea of ​​the movie, was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie that would take him to him. <br /> <br /> Unhinged is ultimately a boring movie with bad acting, inept direction, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (sorry .. I'm not sure where that came from ). You'll get an idea of ​​how bad this movie is during opening credits when, for some reason that is never explained, the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering. Do not waste your time. You will just feel unbalanced and want your time and money back.
