This movie was worth five strokes on my "hurter card". I saw this while I was parked in Virginia in the mid-'70s. I saw it alone so I was not distracted while watching. He sucked. It was the most ridiculous and utter waste of celluloid I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that others who reviewed this movie thought it was incredible. I offer you this: if it was so incredible what was the box office? End of discussion.
