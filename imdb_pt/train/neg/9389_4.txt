According to IMDb, as well as to all other sites that hold a review; this "thing" has no director. Well, that would certainly explain a lot! Just a bunch of people gathered to film some perverted pornographic sequences and cast an ultra-thin plot about demon worship and women's sacrifices inside the walls of an isolated sanitarium. "Hardgore" is a prime example of a fully time-consuming 70's movie, as it is done with a minimum of production values ​​and script inspiration. Horror films about satanic cults were very popular during the early 70's and also pornography, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac who is committed to an asylum, and since the first night she is already involved in a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo action. Really, a lot of action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but her throat is cut that night. The aspects of horror are really poorly crafted, ranging from smugly non-frightening Satan masks to severe and virulent penis attacks. The performance of photography and acting is almost intolerably amateurish, but what do you expect from a movie that shows scenes of sperm dildos and talks about male reproductive organs? Leader Justina Lynn is a pretty girl with a ravishing body, but most of her co-stars (male and female) are horrible and overly hairy.
