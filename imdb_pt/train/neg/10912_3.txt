I really did not really like this movie. It was not very funny and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely an enormously talented individual and while his acting was well on it, it seemed like a real waste for him to star. I mean, there were some parts that were nice and a little funny in a half-cute way, but that's about it. The only thing that really caught my attention during all this ordeal about the best jokes was that there were some very beautiful women and I'm not to watch a movie just because of this but in that case it was the only corner where even the smallest case of redemption could be found. All in all, it was a couple of peaks below an average movie! <br /> <br /> Last query: <br /> <br /> Theaters: So glad I did not waste a lot of money on this. <Br /> <br /> Buy on DVD: Ummm, let me think ... no! <br /> <br /> Rent: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor, why not?
