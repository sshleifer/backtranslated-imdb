Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psychopathic killer trying to kill her on her graduation night. And in doing so, he killed his family, friends and his enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before you begin, let me tell you that you've been sick of PG-13 horror movies that have not been scary lately. You're tired of stupid girl talk 'Oh my god' and talking about girl things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying? And the last thing you're tired of the US redoing Asian, Japanese and Chinese movies. This pretty much sums up the night of graduation, but I have not finished the review yet. <br /> <br /> The only reason to watch 'prom night' is to laugh at the deaths. If not, do not see the night of graduation. You never see the deaths and you just hear screams and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way, the killings are repeating like 24/7. Therefore, they are not only scary but also unpleasant. When I met the cast, I think I was ready to vomit. Lots of girls talk, lots of boys talk, and lots of 'Oh my God. It's our prom. I understand it's fun, but seriously it would be asking too much not to focus. <br /> <br /> If I put Prom Night on the list of the worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films, I would be the first too. I will not be surprised if it's released on DVD for cheap and fast. Seriously, do not spend your money or time to act dull, cheap scares and a 'Night to Die' when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star of 10. (PS If I could give the movie zero stars I would).
