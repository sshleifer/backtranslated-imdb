I found this a good movie to spend your time, but not for any chance of any historical value. Cleopatra's picture reminded me of a cheap novel. <br /> <br /> The twist of facts is ... funny! She gave birth while she fed her people!?!? Please ... A pregnant queen from Egypt (especially this one) would not mind going from one room to another for that reason! They tried to make her look holy for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify it by murdering their own sister ... beyond description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest policy of her time. Her decisions were based on everything but her feelings and morals. She did it all for only two reasons: power and self-preservation! She was born into a family where she had to fight for survival, something she did very well. Anything in his path was murdered (his brothers and sister) or seduced (Ceasar and Mark Anthony). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Octavian was too powerful to kill and also ... gay to be seduced. So, it was the end of it ...
