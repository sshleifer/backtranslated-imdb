End of the World is a monotonous film, which is strange, since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the Earth. The main character is some kind of scientist, I do not know exactly what kind. He has two jobs in a government facility (?) Guarded by four security guards. His first job is to monitor broadcasts to and from space (though this actually looks more like a hobby than he does when he's not working at work # 2). The second job requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room ... at least it's the best I can imagine. Apparently, the "plant" is not exactly top secret, as the scientist brings his wife there. She leaves (they are on their way to dinner) as he discovers a message from space: Major Earth Disruption, repeated several times. It says something about being the first space message he has ever deciphered; his wife says they will be late for dinner. So they go out and go to the party (!?!). Moments later, he discovers that China has suffered a major earthquake. From there, the movie goes ... nothing! Yes, Christopher Lee is at it, but that does not help much. In addition, Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring but has elements stupid enough for you to suffer once, whether you like Christopher Lee or science fiction. In addition, there are many images of the earth being destroyed.
