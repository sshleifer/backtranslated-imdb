What a horrible movie. I can not believe I missed 90 minutes of my life watching this re-make. Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer starred in this movie? Mehki Pfifer is great at E.R and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. The music scene that I must say did not fit ALLLLL with the story and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no life in creating a well-balanced film. I hope that in the future, no director as horrible as this one has been able to distract such a classic movie. This movie should not have been made in the first place. A word of advice to all who saw him, please tell me that I am right, because I could not be the only spectator who did not like him. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.
