I rated the basic instinct 2 high, but this movie received less than 4 points. This movie has only 4 of me but has 7.3 of over 600 people. I do not see any reason why they like this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This movie is annoying because it hardly leaves the rooms in that big house broken. And it only has a total of 5 people in this movie. It's almost two hours long, which is totally unnecessary. Many of the dialogues are slow and meaningless. The tone of the film is also dark blue, which is depressing to watch. The movie can be shortened for a few sentences. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of "Three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien, which is equally boring, the dialogues are also equally boring. Also has a high rating! I had to stop watching it after the first story ended. <br /> <br /> This movie has no passion or enthusiasm.
