Okay, so I'm dying to see this movie. Stoked about the "who's who" in horror land that are in the movie .... well, my friend rented it, brought it, and we started watching. It's supposed to be a comedy .... I did not smile until once, until the 40 minute mark. <br /> <br /> Does it have to do with the budget? No way, actually, there are movies out there that cost ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and they are incredible (for me anyway). Also, while watching this movie, I could not help noticing the similarities (ie STEALING) for a low budget independent movie entitled, "APENCALYPSE ATRIZ", read my comment on it (DESTROY this movie BTW). This movie ... had potential, really. He had the "power of the star", plotting stolen (lets you film the backstage of a movie ... IE ... "ATTRACTION APOCALYPSE" ... seriously, it annoys me the more and more I think about). .. it really could have been funny. VERY, MANY of the jokes fall. Performance is good for what it is. But that crawled, not funny, and the plot was totally stolen. <br /> <br /> I give it to two, because it was not SOOO AWFUL, but that's the only reason.
