I, like many other Bachchan fans, waited anxiously for Sholay's remake. This movie was not that. Thank God they did not let them use the name "Sholay" in the movie title. The remake of Ram Gopal is not worthy of the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the dance totally out of place, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money to the cast. The only unpaid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first film. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for his marriage to Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not bother with this movie or the DVD when it happens.
