The film confuses both religious ethics and ideals that fail to create consistent arguments against the death penalty at any level. In presenting the legal execution of a condemned murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind, the film elevates a killer of fathers to the status of Christ's martyr. Somehow, according to the plot, God is outraged that society has chosen to get rid of a fanatic who killed his own parents, burning them helplessly in their beds. However, this same god has no indignation for the murderer's actions. The main character, a pregnant non-religious suicidal woman, ends up giving her own life in a challenging but implausible attempt to save this condemned murderer unsuccessfully. In other segments of the underdeveloped plot, Jesus returns as an impotent and frustrated tramp to symbolically free the wrath of God. The modern, shining incarnation of Christ not only dehumanizes it, but mocks the Messianic ideal of all religions as well. He is incapable of affecting mankind for good and, without emotion, skates the limits of life, waiting for humanity to destroy itself. Meanwhile, with little help from Jesus, the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate in her soulless newborn son, who somehow saves all mankind from the wrath of the almighty. I also interpreted this as a statement in support of abortion on some levels. This movie, which tries to turn many religious themes into a thriller, does not make any religious point that I can interpret clearly, except mocking people's beliefs. It raises many questions that it never tries to answer. He disregards the religious values ​​of his audience by attempting to portray an asinine version of his achievement. Fool
