Here is an independent movie that I really wanted to like but in the end I could not. The lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows and kills the image. The story is a meaningless mess that is not worth trying to find out. I quickly got bored in 10 minutes, then spent the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before stopping at the chapter to (fortunately) get to the end ... even if it was not worth the extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries very hard to be smart, raising his best sequences of EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has not been done earlier and better. This movie would have been a lot more fun as a short 10 to 20 minutes, but as a feature, it just seems crowded and forced. Of course, there is money in shorts, so I completely understand the financial reasons that I suppose motivated the fact to be extended to more than 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinauer is a great promise and wish good luck to him.
