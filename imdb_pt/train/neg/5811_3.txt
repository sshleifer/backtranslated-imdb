I have not seen this movie for centuries, but I figured I'd comment on it anyway, mainly because the memory of not liking it so intensely is burned into my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was not a prize to begin with, but at least it had the distinctions of being 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) It was a relatively painless way to spend an hour and half of the time. In comparison, the 1994 version appears as little more than a piece of vanity for Alec Baldwin and his divorced wife, Kim Basinger. McQueen and his then-wife, Allie McBride, also separated shortly after their version of the film was made, and you can imagine the Baldwins in the wedding council discussing who the stupid idea is of making this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's just say and get out of the way - Alec Baldwin has never been and will never be anything close to Cooler King, and one of the reasons this remake bothered me so much is Baldwin's perceived arrogance of presume to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. As another person points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a piece of satire to classify the parody of the action / adventure genre. In contrast, Baldwin, Bassinger and company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only unprincipled villains from Michael Madsen and James Woods dating as real people. <br /> <br /> The film is also decidedly bad. witty and unpleasant at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. One sight was more than enough, not just because it had nothing new to offer, but because of the way it was made. Peckinpah's film was actually a small and elegant entertainment that had a climate of optimism, where this version is a task that takes a long time to reach little or nothing. There is no artistic urgency for its existence and some of the most uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that make the film difficult to enjoy. <br /> <br /> So, I do not know, this was probably one of the movies that helped to start the wave of big, mindless, artistically insipid budget remakes backed around a branded actor / actress, which itself is not a really good thing. I always prefer to see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie and come face-to-face with something original. This film just made me want to get my eyebrows out, and is revealing that in the next 15 years since it was released, Baldwin has become widely recognized as one of Hollywood's biggest idiots. Thank God for "Team America" ​​for putting it in its place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
