No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for "The House Next Door" from her 1970s romance of the same title, or someone else did. This Lifetime movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. Having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film was shown in a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when critical moments precede commercials, which, of course, can not be found in this version we see. <br /> <br /> The star of the film is Lara Flynn Boyle, who bears a new look that threw this viewer a turnaround because of the cosmetic transformation that this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of his body, Boyle is not recognizable as Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. This was not one of the best moments of the actress in front of the camera. That goes for the rest of the mostly Canadian actors who deserved the best. The film has a sense of a cross between "Desperate Houswives" with "The Stepford Wives" and other well-known features, combined with a moderate dose of creepiness. The best thing about the movie was the house that serves as the setting.
