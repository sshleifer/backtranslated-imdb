In short, this film is completely useless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think about the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of compelling stories or characters prevents us from suspending our disbelief, so the idea simply ends. <br /> <br /> Apparently the whole movie was made with actors in front of green screens and we're supposed to be impressed. But as a graphic person, over-smoothing was an obvious crutch to hide the difficult problem of sharp edge with green shielding. The color is predominantly washed to have no relevant effect except to reduce the visual quality. And I do not understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie as revolutionary. If anything, ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar to really bad graphics - they do not match the old Jurassic Park graphics. The models for the robots were so simple, simple, and very unusual. There were a bunch of weirdoes prehistoric animals on that island, but they are not explained at all. <br /> <br /> The story is horrible beyond belief. Actually, I can not believe I did not get out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated, and the whole film is based on mistrust and disappointment. Why is the character Morris Paley there? We are by no means convinced that Joe is heroic - I mean he flew a plane and saved a person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little time on the screen, so why should we worry about Joe wanting to save him? Who was the Nepalease who locked Joe and Polly in the mine vault, and why did they do it (remembering that the whole Totenkopf operation was robotic)? <br /> <br /> Plot Holes: (1) Why did Bai Ling's character (a big fall from his excellent character in "The Crow") stop the robots that captured Joe? They searched for the jars and did not find them. (2) Why on earth would Dex be captured, but not dead (he does not have or know about the jars, and the thugs did not know that Polly had the jars and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex)? (3) Polly indicates that "they" know nothing about Totenkopf, but she has a secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete FBI-style file about him. (4) The blank spot on the map as described by the Nepalese - if they know all about this mysterious area, then why on earth is their map blank at that point? (5) At one point, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) - Joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes, but Polly is forced to wear a very strange bulky dress, so in the same line of continuity, all of a sudden, Polly has her original clothes back. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far am I to change my brain to watch this crap? <br /> <br /> We should be excited about the music produced, even when nothing interesting or remotely exciting is happening on the screen. <Br/> <br /> And the acting? Should we be impressed by a lot of bad British accents? Which character is not boring? I think Ling Bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie (she does not have a single line). The dialogue was not the camp and did not even reach the cheese level. It's just bad and annoying. These people are not heroic or attractive; they are the kind of person you would try to ignore or disassociate if you ever had the misfortune to find them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe this movie gets an above-average rating here on IMDb. IMHO must compete with "Batman Forever" in the last 100 of all time.
