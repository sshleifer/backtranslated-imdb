Sixth escape for Freddy Krueger in which he finally managed to kill practically all the youth in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (** SPOILER **) needs a family member to do so. <br /> <br /> A failure like a horror movie because it simply is not scary. It works best as a black and macabre comedy to tell the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all his ability to calm this viewer. (A lot of jokes, of course.) The actors are not interesting (except Robert Englund, as always, and obviously a Yaphet Kotto) and there are just so many visual effects. The ending is good, but it does not provide as many sparks as I think can be expected. <br /> <br /> By adding a new twist to the family history of the dream killer, it offers Englund the opportunity to do more makeup without makeup. <br /> <br /> There are a few notable appearances: a joint participation of then-married couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold who is devoid of entertainment value, a fitting appearance by veteran rocker Alice Cooper, and a special guest appearance by Johnny Depp who also kind of recognized the pop icon that he had become. <br /> <br /> Breckin Meyer's film debut, which plays Spencer. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about is the repetition of key scenes from previous entries during the final credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
