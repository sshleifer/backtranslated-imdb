This had to be one of the worst movies of all time. When Kate shows up and Jed has a bunch of guys and everyone starts clapping ... then Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands down the sidewalk it looked like she was examining the texture of the pavement. Andie's acting is so bad in this movie - I could not connect with them or feel love between them. The other two women, however, were very good and dazzled Andie. Anyway, this was such an exaggerated movie. I usually like this kind of movie, but I could not get into that movie. Many unlikely situations and again the acting of Andie did not help the film. Plus, it's all gums. Lancome should put her makeup on with a spatula because she looks glamorous in commercials.
