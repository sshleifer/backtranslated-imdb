I have always said that some pieces, by their very nature, can not be translated into film, and this is a prime example. <br /> <br /> As a play, this is a very funny farce satire of Catholics. church, with a sharp intelligence and a central character who is so shockingly unreal that we have to root for her when she begins to kill her parishioners (one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting that he had not sinned since his last confession, then she feels she is sending him straight to the sky). <br /> <br /> This is just an example of how far away the reality of the play is, and in the theater world, this works. However, this kind of intensified reality rarely works in the movies, and it certainly is not here. <br /> <br /> Director Marshall Brickman has put together an excellent cast that does a great job, but presenting all this absurdity realistically. fashion comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of the stomach. <br /> <br /> Look for a production of the play, you will not be disappointed.
