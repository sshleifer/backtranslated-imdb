A truly terrible Canadian-German co-production, the ever-wondrous Rosanna Arquette portrays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "troubled child" - a few years before the "action" in which the child murdered her father and mother led to the fall of the offspring. Now she has moved to the northwestern US to start over, but her son still has a problem where she is dedicated to her mother. So devoted, in fact, that it kills anyone who can be seen as a threat to their bond. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (like her daughter) kills more than people - she performs so terrible that she also cleans. the film, although the incoherent script, useless direction and shocking music (check out the saxophone the first time she shows off her bikini body) does not help at all; We must find her sexy and scary, but she fails in both cases. Almost completely uninteresting and not bad enough to be entertaining (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer do not really convince as mother and daughter), all condolences to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, both of which are worthy of much more that this, and both (particularly Rosanna) are the only sensible reasons for anyone to go through that binge. <br /> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three hours "Love, Lies and Murder" (of two short productions) there has been such a "You should be joking" credit.
