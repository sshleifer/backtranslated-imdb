When you look back at another sequel to Nightmare like Freddy's Revenge, you have to at least give some credit for trying something new. And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable, it does not offer anything new to the series. Yes, there are creative deaths as usual, as a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing "Super Freddy", but even scenes like that are not accustomed to their full potential and parties without Freddy are just annoying . This marked the official death of fear in the series. Freddy seems to be the comic relief now ... but to what? My rating: 4/10
