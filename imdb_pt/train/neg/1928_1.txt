As the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful Christmas cartoon that anyone could enjoy with ease, I've never seen the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the design was perfect enough, what is the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a bit strange Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean, he's a great comedy actor, but he's like the Grinch? It simply did not make any sense to me. His performance was a bit exaggerated and unintentionally laughable at times. Not to mention that some of the dialogues added were a bit childish and not pleasant. The whole story of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over and was not necessary. In fact, they just destroyed the story, the period. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Whoville is getting ready for the best Christmas season, where everything must happen perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he will not be as well at Christmas as the other one is. He kicks her out and decides that he does not want Christmas this year and that, in fact, he should just steal Christmas all together to show who his Christmas version is. But soon he realizes who can know that it is a little more than it is the materialized version of Christmas. <br /> <br /> As the Grinch Stole Christmas was not needed and was a little overdone. I really recommend you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a rather disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make-up and presentation of the entire film went a little longer, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more to be a cartoon than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the version of Boris Karloff that is played every Christmas. <br /> 1/10
