Below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music ??? Ordinary Script and Direction with full of errors. Salman Khan was in his usual performance. Ajay's performance deteriorating over time according to his appearance, especially his styles like Rock Star, were pathetic. Asin was just a show piece. Overall, I felt like wasting my money on the movies. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were lots of songs in the movie all boring except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song to impress the UK music sponsor was the most impressive. "Khanabadosh" can be easily understood by an English music sponsor. The other film I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid," which was simple love story slow, with good direction and acting despite the average music
