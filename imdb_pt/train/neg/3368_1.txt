For movie fans who have never heard of the book ("The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson) and have never seen Robert Wise's 1963 production of Julie Harris, this remake will look pretty bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have it, it's just horrible. <br /> <br /> Bad acting (what was Neeson thinking?), Computer improvements and a departure from Jackson's story condemn this remake. <Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. It still effectively freaks out with no fake special effects. The acting is professional and believable. <br /> <br /> For readers of the book, the 1963 follows much more closely.
