First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she's just horrible. This movie has all the clich√©s of terror in the imagination, and all badly played. The teenage couple sexually excited. The comic athlete (not) horny. The girl is cool and moody. The scary local color guy. The parental couple. The virgin girl who incredibly never dies in these movies. The dialogue is so terribly awful and delivered with the depth of a shallow pool. It's almost like you're wishing everyone would die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this movie a while ago, but somehow, it just got worse. Of course, the funniest thing here is that the ghoul tries to eat Jameson's implants, but that hardly qualifies for renting the dog. Avoid at all costs.
