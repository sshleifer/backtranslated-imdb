This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel films. I am accustomed to seeing the CGI's gray stains and amateur special effects, such as fake blood close-ups, which make it very obvious that blood is strawberry syrup or some other variation of syrup. However, I thought I had seen every possible minimum that the Sci-Fi Channel could achieve. So I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand inside a rubbery stocking that is glazed with syrup? These are the top alien vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubber stock puppets. A talking hand comes out of the guts of the victims, and the Vampire on the Vampire Hunter team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvania. How did the alien vampires learn Transylvania? And is not Transylvania in Romania? So they should not be speaking Romanian? Why would a small town have its own language? If you can suspend your reflex of vomit and pass the rubber stockings with your fingers moving clearly inside the head of the aliens; so you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are Leatherfaces who like to use the faces of their victims. Then there are the plain and ugly ones that seem to have many facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so they can sabotage Defense Systems for these space vampires to attack. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth laughing at, you have to deal with the third-rate TV cast of the network rejects that make up this team of angry stereotyped heroes who are constantly fighting each other. Why do almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie have to use main characters that are annoying, abrasive, coarse or just plain unfriendly? I found myself hoping that the rubber socks would win.
