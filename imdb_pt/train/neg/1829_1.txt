Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben any more. How this man can still make movies is beyond me. I can not understand how this happens if I introduce myself at work the way he acts in a movie I would have been fired and I am the owner of the company ..... I would have to resign. GOD! This film was just a smoldering and stinking pile of OOP, which needs to be vapoorized, if at all possible. Another thing I have to say about the 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why websites will require a small written novel when sometimes a brief commentary is all that is needed.
