The early '90s brought many independent "eccentric" and "out of rhythm" films, a particular subgenre of which is the semi-spiritual crime film in the desert. Others of note are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn", and to a certain extent "Natural Born Killers". Good movies like these have generated garbage like "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns on the Radio" and this unprecedented and surreal masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon." It's a comedy that aims at a certain emotional tone, hits it, but keeps getting to the point of irritation. While chasing through the desert spiritual world and Chris Penn's cast are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough to be a good criminal film, and is not focused enough on laughter to actually be a comedy. . I will not blow the ending, but let's just say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of gender cancer. This is the residue of indie-mania.
