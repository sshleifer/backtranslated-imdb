I watched this movie and I have to say that with such a premise and incredible talent, this turkey is there !!! A friend lent me this film and I watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie began with Kevin Costner as a retired hunting pilot ... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He was supposed to be hired by Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot ... well, we never see Costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner runs into a Texan (James Gammon) selling a horse to a great Mexican businessman and Costner brand together for a ride. Without knowing what happened, Gammon is beaten to death and Costner takes him to the meeting, which happens to an associate of Quinn! But nothing comes of it ... nothing, zilcho! Why did they have the character of Gammon? Why had they sold horses with Quinn's partner if nothing happened? <br /> <br /> In addition, after they leave Costner to die, they make Madeline Stowe's character become a prostitute, so she attacks one of Quinn's men who was paying for a turn ... she stab her with her own knife, and the next thing she was transferred to a convent! No explanation as to why it was moved, or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much talent wasted on such a poor script and poor editing !! I just watched it because a friend owned it and let me watch it ... I'm going to play it for him for the 2 hours I missed out on my life watching the damn thing!
