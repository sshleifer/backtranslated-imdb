What a missed opportunity to really make an interesting movie about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what really seems to be a straight man (or gay) working in a gay sexual environment. Dancers continue to talk about their art as if it did not have an erotic component. Not everyone can be a prostitute for rent, but they are, in fact, sex workers playing fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film, it would seem that they attract mostly women who go to gay clubs and end up hiring the "dancers" for private sessions. Even the shots at the club only show the women in front of the stage and the "dancers" only play for the women in the audience. This is not the reality of these clubs. It would be very difficult to earn a living doing private dances for women and heterosexual couples. So, what do they really feel about their gay admirers and customers? We learned very little. Instead, we have padding. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of heterosexual dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the trailing acts, but offers no insight into the lives and attitudes of the dancers. <br /> <br /> The photos of Mexico City are generic. The phallic montage showing baking sausages is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a totally simplistic movie that should be of interest only to those who want to see some pictures of cute boys dancing. The rest of the movie is an insult to gays.
