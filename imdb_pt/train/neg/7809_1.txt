Definitely a strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling around him. Cecil picks up a phone book, looks up a preacher's name, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's house and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and to have Jesus in his heart. That makes it all better. Ahh ... if everything in life were that easy. The fact that this "movie" seems to have been made at about $ 500 certainly does not help. 1/10
