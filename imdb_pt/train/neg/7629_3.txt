I gave this film a very fair chance, and it betrayed me. This is little more than a black-and-white excuse to annoy the audience even when selfish Bogdanavich (who did better with TARGETS) gets "great performances" from a ton of hams in their debut. Many teenage sex cliches come out of this movie, like Making the Wife of the Teacher, Impotence, Making the Ugly Prostitute (which is very clumsily shot and spoils things completely, not that things were really going anywhere) I suppose this movie is funny because of all the nonsense of sex, to me, it was just annoying. I was seriously much more entertained cleaning my nails than watching this mess.
