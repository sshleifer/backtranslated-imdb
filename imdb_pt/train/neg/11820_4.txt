I've seen it on DVD (it's known as CORRUPT in this format) and the synopsis in the case really excited how Harvey Keitel's character Frank is very much like what he played the DEATH LUTUANT in "This cop and powerful cop thriller" . Well, when a character plays music he does not put on the CD player, he picks up a big plastic pancake thing, puts it in a kind of turntable where a type of mechanical arm touches the pancake thing causing the music to be heard.You see my point about this being an old movie? The case of the DVD did not give clues that this film was made 20 years ago , But it is a film with poor production values, like so many other Italian films disguised as Americans. With the exception of Keitel, the cast is horrible, although Johnny Rotten's performance is bizarre and not terrible, cinematography is static with quality image and sound, giving the impression of watching a fourth-generation pirate copy (I do not know if it's a dubious DVD or if it's a really bad movie) and worst of all it's Ennio Morricone's score. dictating that the man who made the annoying incidental intrusive music for CORRUPT is the same one who made the music for those Clint Eastwoods. <br /> <br /> All this is a shame because CORRUPT has its moments. It's by no means the greatest psychological thriller ever invented, but it really interested me and, as always, Keitel does a good job as a violent crazy cop. Just a pity that the rest of the movie did not live up to its high standards
