I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and I thought it would be nice to see locations I know in a movie. I really knew I was not going to get the inside jokes, so I was not surprised when I sat with the deer in the headlights. What struck me was the actions of non-Mormons that were made in this film. <br /> <br /> I know it's a Mormon movie, served to members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of it. the stereotype typical of people who are not of their faith. All non-Mormons, who were not many, drank, smoked, and had an incredible attitude of selfishness, why? <br /> <br /> This really impressed me in this movie, they made the Mormons so pure, but the rest of the state of Utah, I think it is filled with punk psychopaths just because they do not follow the scriptures of the LDS Church. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the plots revolve around all LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not even close to being true. And like I said, the non-Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken idiots, please! <br /> <br /> I guess I do not understand why I do not belong to their faith and I think it never will.
