What a waste of time! I tried to sit through 'Sky Captain ..' about 6 times, and every time, in about 3 minutes, I started doing something else - anything else! It's a boring movie, the acting is terrible, the writing without grace, and obviously a first-time director, because it's hard, and I wanted to love it, I love science fiction, the old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate trying to agree with Flash Gordon, and Metropolis, but my God, who I used to work for Paramount Pictures, and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 on using blue screen for screen tests. She told me that they would never have interest or need to do it 10 years later, the Paramount Sherry releases was right in 1993, but must have forgotten her own advice when she gave this dog a goblin. A blue screen was an effect but not a whole movie. Let's not forget, neither Jude nor Jolie are wonderful actors (but easy on the eyes ) Paltrow's performance reminds me of one Very bad collegiate forfeit - could have run ed, but only under a skillful director. The funny thing is that the director of Captain Sky will continue to work, even after this accident. It's trade, not art!
