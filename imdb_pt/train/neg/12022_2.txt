The idea of ​​the story is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution leaves it down. <br /> <br /> The film has no rhythm on the one hand. It should be an exciting ride, but it is slow and more than a little annoying. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mostly in the script and in the editing. There are not enough obstacles and reversals to increase suspense, and there are scenes that do not really move the story very effectively. <br /> <br /> The producers should have seen this in the script and insisted on a major rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also the writer and the director, this is clearly not going to happen. <br /> <br /> Much of the acting seems a bit boring, and that's up to the director - all the actors have been very competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because with better writing, editing and directing, this could have been a really good thriller.
