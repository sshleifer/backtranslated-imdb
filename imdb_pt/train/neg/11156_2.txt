Black Wolf (Quick Review) Let's get right to the point: this is a disgusting piece of run over run over by cow. It's just a horrible movie. It's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst imaginable acts and a story as faint as any geeky nerd in a high school drama movie of the '80s. Worst is that poor Kane Hodder was fooled into playing the giant werewolf. Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone is trying to make sure that playing Jason Voorhees is the pinnacle of his film career ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, former comic book partner Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and she also becomes a werewolf too . It's kind of like a fucking cop with the meanest werewolf in the world. But there are moments of almost unbridled nudity. But that's all. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is usually an ugly-looking black blur that goes through the screen. And when we are privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence, we are introduced to something that resembles a full-motion video of a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation. The first Playstation. The CG animation is really so primitive. Only good for hardcore horror fanatics who want to see little moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
