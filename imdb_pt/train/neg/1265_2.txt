First I did not want to watch this movie, because the trailer gave the impression of a common and long awaited film ... but as recently I was pleased to discover the surprising "Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité" "beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard (writer of "prête-moi ta main"), I changed my mind and decided to try, thinking that "Prête-moi ta main" would be as good as "mensonges ..." And it's absolutely nothing. , but not as well directed as "Mensonges ...", the actors are not as generous (especially Charlotte, as annoying as she usually is) like Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac., and also be honest, I still do not understand how this crap can be so successful, even with this casting ... Anyway, the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots, but it's not quite as good as Tirard's "Mensonges." has been written by him. without surprise and lazy. Totally overrated!
