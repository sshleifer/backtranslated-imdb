It really does not matter that Superman comic books are incredibly naive and their target is ten years old. What matters is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, a question for you, dear readers, how many of you really believe that Superman will be defeated by bald Kevin Spacey? Anyone? Just like I thought. There are no spoilers here. So let's go to some important issues now. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this movie looks commercial (scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is just the scene that looks like it should). Imagine Superman's commercial, two and a half hour long. Let's be serious this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed." You really feel like this movie is too long. And special effects are not so special by the way. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenery is silly. Sometimes even if something is acceptable in comics, in the movies it just seems stupid. And so it is in this case. Of course the dialogues are a disgrace. I do not believe anyone took money to write them. How many times will we be fed with the villain making speeches? How many times will the laws of physics be raped? (Jesus, it is not only the question of Superman's strength, but also the resistance of the materials with which he deals.) How many times will Lois Lane be deceived by Kent? How many times will Hollywood producers go looking for a useless comic book? Since it's hard to make a good story, why have a weak history for a match? It just does not work. Guys, control yourself. Try more, please. Or just stay on that strike forever, who cares. I have the feeling that the WGA is permanently on strike. No offense. I'm not questioning the money these people get paid, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case, there is no quality whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the acting is weak, which is a big surprise, as Bryan Singer (Comfortable Suspects) is driving. Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he's the only one. The audience is no longer willing to joke. The thing is that the comic book hero can be developed into real personality, with clear motivations, but also with doubts, fears, some depth. In this case, no one has done that job and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the whole effort of the creators turns this movie into a parody. The second unit is so bad that it draws attention, since there is nothing interesting happening on the screen anyway. The more they try (if they try), the funnier it gets (but it's not laughter You could wait). Final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular movie, Ladies and Gentlemen, is camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money either. Stay at home, read a book.
