After a long period in space, searching for the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who married and has a child with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) traces an evil plan, using crystals he stole from the Fortress of Solitude, to create a new land and submerge the US. After so many wonderful Superman films with the Unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a great expectation was created for the return of Superman in the version of this Bryan Singer. Unfortunately, the terrible story is very long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of emotion and overrated in IMDb. Plus, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is shamefully ridiculous. The twenty-two-year-old actress, Kate Bosworth, is mistakenly mistaken for a mature reporter and seasoned mother of a five-year-old boy. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager Clark Kent in "Smallville." The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a silly caricature. Last but not least and despite being an excellent Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, therefore older and older than the rest of the main cast. The tacky conclusion sounds like a soap opera and it's terrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman returns"
