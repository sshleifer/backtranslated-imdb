In my life I have seen many great and terrible films. I'm not an expert on professional reviews, but I definitely have something to say about it. Firstly, these actors are the worst I've seen ... Their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think these actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> Another horrible thing is about these dialogues - they are so dumb. You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It looks like your 14-year-old son could do better. I feel that this film had a budget similar to the cost of my European car of 14 years ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message reaches you - save your time and money.
