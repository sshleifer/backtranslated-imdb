I saw this recent Woody Allen movie because I'm a fan of his work and I make a point of trying to see everything he does, although the reviews in this movie have led me to expect a disappointing effort. They were right. This is a confusing film that can not decide whether to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy or a drama about the female midlife crisis. He failed at all three. Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle-aged woman who has married in great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and her two small children. This rather mundane plot is animated with as many implausibilities as an ancient Chinese healer who makes it invisible with some magic herbs, and the ghost of an ex-lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If those additions seem too fantastic for you, how about something more prosaic, like a case with a saxophonist? <br /> <br /> I was never sure what this mess was trying to say. There are only a handful of truly funny moments in the movie, and the ending is a really absurd touch of Pollyanna. <br /> <br /> Rent 'crimes and misdemeanors' instead, a superbly well-done film that combines comedy combination with a serious consideration of ethics and morals. Or go back to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan."
