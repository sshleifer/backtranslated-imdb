This is a weird sex comedy because there is very little comedy but a lot of sex, most of which happens in the back of a car and is so graphical that it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES. I'm not joking, the sex in this movie is so in your face that it may just smother you, especially if you're watching with your grandparents. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB ALSO there is much more worth mentioning except the language in which every phrase seems to contain the F word. This is a rather hyper-realistic British film somber made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British films, which explains why its made for low budget television feel
