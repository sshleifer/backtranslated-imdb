After reading some very good reviews about this movie, I thought I'd give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the movie, I thought about doing my own review. This is my first time so naked with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would scratch the horror of the genre, since it is by no means horrible or scary (with the exception of a few weak attempts to make you jump, unfortunately, one of whom worked on me.) I'd say calling this movie a thriller is pushing it like I was not particularly happy either! The movie is about a spoiled and sulky girl who faints a few times. During these periods, she visits a house she is drawing. After each visit, she decides to add something else to the house to make it a little more lively, being one of the characteristics a sad boy who is also sick in reality. As she befriends the boy, she realizes that her imaginary world she has created is actually better than the real world she is in. Until she adds her father constantly away to the house, due to an abuse her father turns out to be evil and she and the boy must escape from their clutches. <br /> <br /> Think it's an attempt to be a slightly softer version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but it's more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, my generous 3/10 will, hopefully, prevent at least one of you from watching this monotonous!
