Films like these are for the originals which are the seasons of Album Oriented Rock for what music used to be - repetitive, boring and exhausted of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones. I'm glad that Aragorn was not labeled as an expectant psychopath by this P.O.S. Go back and watch the 1971 version, tell the things that would NEVER be included in a modern version, and thank any deity you love for someone somewhere in the distant past to have the courage to write and film an original conceptual film that was not based on someone else's ideas, and was not passed through a corporate board before seeing the light of day.
