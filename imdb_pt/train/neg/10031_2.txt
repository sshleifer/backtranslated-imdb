I just saw the movie in the theater. The film has very few good points to speak about. The beauty of Kareena and some songs can be. That's it. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed, even the Mumbai Indians too (now Chennai has reached the semifinal). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Now, Bollywood is trying to copy Hollywood action scenes. But they forget that Hollywood directors do much to make it look real. But unfortunately the directors of Bollywood do not have that much time. They spend their time on music and advertising the movie. Now such idiotic action scenes can work in the south, as the public only pays to watch their favorite actor killing many people. But in Bollywood this certainly will not work. All the action scenes I wish I had taken. In the end, even some Chinese appear out of nowhere to defeat Akshay Kumar. That's stupid time. The audience is not paying to watch such stupidity. I think Bollywood should now forget the action movies. They can not do that. The last good deed I saw was "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is very sad for fans of action movies like me. Do these people watch the movie after completion? Can not they find out that slow-motion action (which is done using ropes) is very unrealistic and childish? Better not have action scenes if you can not handle it. I just want to go back to the Amitabh era, where movies like Zanjeer and Deewar were having exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than the scenes of the current era. <br /> <br /> This movie should now open the eyes of Bollywood filmmakers. Please do not do more action movies until you get the art of making it realistic.
