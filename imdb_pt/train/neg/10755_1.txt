I can not really think of any redeeming feature of this totally bad interpretation in Asimov than in the direction of art. Forget the product placement disaster, Will Smith's unconvincing performance and gigantic conspiracy holes. This was not just laughable and painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mix of MTV inspired production values ​​and an extremely poor dialogue, probably aimed at very young children. What a shame this science fiction can still be made after we have Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (by the same director). This really belongs to the list of the 100 lowest. Really awful.
