About 15 minutes, my wife was already wanting to leave. Not so much because of the material, but the lack of it. They decided to fill in the blanks where funny things should be with as much language and utterly vulgar talk as they could. When that would leave (very rare), we would sit and watch (not laughing, remember) and wait for the next rough or offensive remark. After about 35 minutes, we got up and left. Everything we read said how great that was. The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert really called him "smart" and said it was not a rough sex comedy. He went to the right movie? Along with Be Cool, it's the only other movie I've ever had ... and I do not regret it. I'm tired of trying to go see comedies in America.
