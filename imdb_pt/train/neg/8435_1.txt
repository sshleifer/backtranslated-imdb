Very disappointing movie. In the end, I did not care about any of the characters anymore. I enjoyed watching Ving Rhames in a very small part, and William Macy was fine as always, still not worth watching. It starts strong and grows weaker and weaker. The insomniacs will like it, because I'm sure they go to sleep.
