A slow, tedious and one-dimensional movie! Good cast with cliche dialogue, boring plot and unspeakable direction of Mr. Marshal! The conventional and predictable history of the most famous form of prostitution on the Asian continent lacks spirits, new insights and depth. The main character seems out of place due to his little phisique and fake contact lenses. The lexicon employed by geisha is forced and a little too sophisticated for its limited exposure to forms of education. The story continues for hours trying to convince him that this boring and boring Asian girl is the definitive Geisha, they actually say in the movie "She's destined to become a legend," I say the case! The movie is simply boring, it's beautiful to watch, it has a few interesting moments as many you might find coming out with cigarettes. Basically, if you do not believe in the messenger, you will not believe the message, and that girl did not fill her shoe! Borin, boring, skip this!
