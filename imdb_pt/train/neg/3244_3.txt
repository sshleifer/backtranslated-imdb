The effect of this story on a psychiatrist who engages with crooks is so polite that I have to assume that this was the intended intention. The sets are artificial and at no point did I feel like I was watching a movie. It seemed the actors were just reading their lines rather than answering each other. While the film has elements from the beginning of the film noir (except that it is colorful) the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. Given that the presentation had no appeal to me, I was at least expecting an engaging story. Usually I'm very slow in taking when it comes to stories with twists, but you can see what was coming here in the first fifteen minutes. At the time of the moment "I forgot the $ 80,000," I thought to myself that this thing is really ridiculous. For a psychiatrist with stated experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is unbelievable. If at any point she had behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have collapsed. <br /> <br /> This production of wood left me cold.
