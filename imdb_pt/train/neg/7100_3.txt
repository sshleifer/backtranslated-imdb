This movie makes a promising start and then gets very confusing and confusing. Kamal Hasan made a great effort to make the period look right, pity that he did not spend more time in the plot. Most of the small characters in the movie appear for no particular reason. <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
