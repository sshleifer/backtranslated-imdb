There will be a time when children will have grown up without ever having seen the only Bugsy Kiss (technically) another man in the mouth. There will be a time when it will not be the Duck or Rabbit season. There will be a time when the Tazmanian Devil will be dubbed politically incorrect. <br /> <br /> But then helping me now is not that time. <br /> <br /> Nobody really wants an 'EXTREME' version of our beloved Loony characters. Whoever it is in marketing that comes with "Corn Nuts: Corn gone wrong" and "Extreme Doritos" and of course this excrement should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or what does not mean that they know Jack about children. <br /> <br /> I think they are doing a disservice to children, depriving them of one of the biggest and most iconic shows of all time. This show pisses me off, and it's not just the dated artwork or a terrible dialogue. They misuse the talents of the good voice, such as Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo and so many others. There is a lack of style, humor, character development and, most importantly, heart. <br /> <br /> The show, like the remonstrated characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny), is just a shadow of what is old, timeless and beautiful me.
