Ulises is a literature professor who comes to a coastal city. There he fell in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in town. They will begin a torrid romance that will end with the tragic death of Ulysses at sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city and lives a happy and quiet life, surrounded by money. One day, the appearance of Ulysses will cause his passion to rise and act without thinking of the consequences. The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent role. In addition, three-quarters of the film are sexual acts, which, although well filmed, are quite tiring, since we want to see more development of the story. It's just a bad movie from Bigas Luna, with lots of sex, no arguments and stupid characters everywhere.
