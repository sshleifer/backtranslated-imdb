Make up your own mind. Personally I found it as fun as receiving a lumbar puncture from Stevie Wonder. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's comedy, but I think it's stupid. They are not exactly the first two choices to take care of your children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drink vendors, to avoid jail time are ordered by a court to direct two children to a development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a fifth-grader with dirty mouth and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a timid young man who plays the roller coaster in a medieval fantasy world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their offices an invaluable insight into life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with his dry humor analogies. Supporters are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
