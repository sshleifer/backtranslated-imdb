Sometimes I can not understand what the directors think when they make a movie ... I had a trauma after watching Welcome (2007) and I thought they would not do it again. But after many incredible promotions, Tashan finally ended up as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Such amazing 3 promo songs - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what did you get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, many acrobatics of Akshay Kumar and nothing interesting besides watching Kareena after his great weight loss ... !!! Another great musical disaster ... on the music album, they spent time giving little pathetic dialogues of these 4 jokers and they did not think about giving the background music of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing acrobatics .. .! this song is so cool, quite comparable to Tashan Mein and not taken from the music album !!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I would say, watch to hear that background music that is something like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> Overall, very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji tried to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go away dear, I need to vomit!
