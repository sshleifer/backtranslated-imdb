I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", all telling this story! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it was not. I found myself looking at my watch for only 40 minutes for this, being bored to death. Jean Arthur's character was a bit annoying and James Ellison did not even seem to act like "Buffalo Bill". Cooper was also not at his best, looking like a lot of wood. That was several years before he reached his peak as an actor. <br /> <br /> In short, your Western shot plans. Climb the pass and watch another boat because most of them were much better than this.
