In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps without panties, fancy about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a magazine from a newsstand and covets a young scholar he meets at the train station . And he's the hero of this senseless movie that's all dressed up (except for Krabbe in at least one more scene), but he has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple, but is dragged for almost two hours before reaching a nonsensical conclusion. Verhoeven has a beautiful look, but uses scenes of wild hallucinations, symbolism and unnecessary gore when he runs out of ideas.
