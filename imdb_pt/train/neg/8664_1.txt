This is just a joke from a movie, they've already lost me in the opening scene (Spoilerwarning) dangerous creature kills another creature in its cage, this is assisted by a scientist working there on a monitor and guess what it does, well lets go to the cage to check things, omg how stupid those writers think humans are, it's the same as jumping into an aquarium with a great white shark because he ate his goldfish ... Very useless and even dumber and nor am I going to talk about the cast because they are not worth the effort. why they did not fire the guy who wrote this immediately is a mystery to me ..... And that kind of stupidity continues the whole movie. Only good thing where CGI is better than average for these low budget movies. <br /> <br /> If that kind of thing does not bother you you'll see, but be warned if your IQ is over 60 you probably hate it.
