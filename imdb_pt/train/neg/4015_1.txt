a friend told me it was another classic like "Debbie does Dallas." Nowhere near. I think my main complaint is about the most uninteresting mainstream actress in the porn industry of all time. Even more terrible is that she's on the screen practically all the time. But I read somewhere that, in those days, pornography had to have some "artistic" value. I could not find it though. See it only if you are interested in the history of the development of pornography in mainstream, or can enjoy the art in pornographic films. I know I'm not. But the film's director seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they rejected it.
