I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason, but this is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant cast of legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Housewives") could not save this useless piece of junk. This movie should serve as a lesson to all past, present and future filmmakers ... when you have a movie as successful as the original "Corpse Grinders" you should probably leave dogs sleeping and you definitely should not try to revitalize it more than twenty years later (unless you have the financial backing to pull a top sequel, as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with "Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat") Even if you decide to do this you should probably spend a little more money than you did in the original and, for God's sake ... NEVER film a movie on video ... why the filmmakers try to do this when everyone knows that the quality will look horrible ... I personally have yet to see a movie made that way worth the dust to blow it up in hell ... if you can not afford to do a better sequence than your original movie, then sell the movie rights to someone who can ... and what was Ted V Mikels thinking (or smoking) when he wrote this god-a wful script? I mean, dog and cat "foreigners" from another planet? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of crushing human bodies ... bones, clothes and all? If any of these actors, besides Liz Renay, receive more than five dollars for their heinous performances, they are overpaid! Avoid this movie at all costs and watch the original.
