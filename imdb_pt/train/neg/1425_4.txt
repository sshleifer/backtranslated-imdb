I'm not sure what HK movies the other reviewers are watching, but Enter the Eagles is not even close to the top of the stack in HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be happy to get a job as an actress in Hong Kong because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better at leg fighting than her father), but her acting skills are also insignificant. In fact, all English dialogue (90% of the film - even more so than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to save me from the misery of the poor delivery of dialogue and the redundancy of English . subs. Of course, there are some decent shootings (but nothing we have not seen before) and good photography, but the extravagant visual effects really spoil the action. <br /> <br /> That said, it's worth the price of admission to watch Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez go there. Spectacular, and almost worth watching the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, you may notice some scenes that look "familiar" to you, notably a gunfight at an open-air market (think Matrix) and Fitz diving off a helicopter wearing black clothes (think MI: 2 ). I think someone thought that at least some things in this movie were worth being stolen.
