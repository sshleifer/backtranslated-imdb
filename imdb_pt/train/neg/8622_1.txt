Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came, there has been a lot of talk about a revival of the Hong Kong film industry. Do not believe. People now making movies in HK give new meaning to the word crass. Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name drawn here, but he spends most of the film just grinning silly and tossing a coin. He flips the coin over and over again and again and again. Because? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a cop who chases the handsome kid who uses the coin. But again: who knows why? There is a beautiful female lead actress who runs some kind of company and she has to pay a ransom or something, but most of the time it seems she would rather be in a spa or mall than in front of a camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
