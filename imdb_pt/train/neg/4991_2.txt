One of the worst movies I've ever seen poor camera work, use of poor quality filter, film was grainy, script was terrible, I mean, come on, how predictable was the big battle in the end ..... Some of the fighting scenes were ok I guess .... Some scenes were so bad that it was comical ... like Sorbo getting the horse and walking in the end ... LOL I I mean really ... a horse? Oh can not forget how bad killers roll in the same vehicle throughout the movie .. one would think that after murdering key witnesses and federal agents, they would have been tracked..ETC, ETC really do not bother watching it .. .
