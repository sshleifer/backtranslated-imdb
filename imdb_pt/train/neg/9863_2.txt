Christopher Guest does not need to worry, his supreme mastery over the subgenre Mockumentary is not in a hurry to be overshadowed in the least, especially not for this extremely bland jab in RPG players. The jokes are beyond lame. Substance insufficient to last the typical length of an SNL satire (particularly rancid), let alone the atrocious 87 minutes I girded observing this idiocy. The great William Katt (greatest American hero, House) deserves much more. One thing and one thing only make the fact that I've seen it worth it in my mind and that's posting about it here so hopefully I'll save someone from such a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My Note: D- <br /> <br /> DVD extras: 2 audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 scenes deleted; & theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom Extras: 2 Wallpapers <br /> <br /> Easter Egg: Highlight the eye on the picture in the main menu for a short scene
