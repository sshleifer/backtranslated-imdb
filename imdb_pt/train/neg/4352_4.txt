If you've seen Friends, the writing will be very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy settings. <br /> <br /> The show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still very young (about 10 years old I think). Now, they are in their early twenties, and they meet again in a class reunion. This is where the series begins. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with several lines of history at once. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut into several sections, which are shown in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> Sketches are where my problems are with this series. As in the last seasons of Friends, it is often a rather silly scenario with situations difficult to believe. One of the main characters does something really stupid that is hard to believe. The situation is then heavily exaggerated, as if it were not foolish enough. If you enjoy this type of humor, maybe you like this series. For me, it's a great way out. <br /> <br /> The reason I started watching Friends is because of the first seasons. There are interesting and especially reliable stories with some novels that make you cheer for the characters. The class does not have any of that. The characters are simply forced too hard and the stereotypes are taken too far. Therefore, it is not possible to relate to them and like them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, it took several seasons before it lost its strength and the character traits were all eliminated. But in The Class, it seems that he ran out of energy before he even started.
