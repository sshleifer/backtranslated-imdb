TV influences society ... just look at the increasing popularity of cappuccino stores after that little shallow work has been released. Also, real people who look as good as these people have no problem. <br /> <br /> In addition, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a beautiful Manhattan loft considering what a living make? NBC loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if it's close to Gump's level. I know a person who earns $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a small one-room apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2200 a month in rent. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a show called Phriends, where there are six ugly no-frills jobs, living in a miserable neighborhood where sirens constantly lament and someone is mugged every week ... and then the landlord increases the rent. Now I watched.
