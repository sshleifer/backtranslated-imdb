It's very simple. Friends is a very basic comedy of humor directed at teenagers and young adults, with an unsophisticated sense of humor. <br /> <br /> It's also painfully obvious that, in the end, they were desperately trying to make it last for 10 seasons, most likely they could say they won the Seinfeld 9 season. The problem is that Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great compositions, Friends (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 seasons OK and 4 terrible seasons. <br /> <br /> A novel with recycled humor and recycled character traits that were not so good at first, so it got worse the hundredth time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate it so well. It's truly awful.
