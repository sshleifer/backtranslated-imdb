Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels of the English language and this writer should read it. I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is. This movie is unbearable to see if you have read the book. <br /> <br /> The whole 'red room' is so low that I wonder why they bother to put it on. In the book, the 'red room' is a harbinger of the whole story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated so poorly in the movie that I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most attractive characters and she was not the redhead. The whole Christian theme is missing in your life and the rest of the movie. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully said.
