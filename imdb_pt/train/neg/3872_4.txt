The film never becomes intolerable to watch. And to tell you the truth, there's nothing to show except perhaps sexy-part Alicia Silverstone in a non-sexy nerd character in revealing very sexy dresses. The story is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see it anyway. There is no suspense, little action, inexpressive dialogues, unsatisfying sensuality, the same boring places and very soft acting. Kevin Dillon is totally useless. Silverstone ... well, I did not concentrate much on his performance, I confess. However, as I said earlier, if someone has nothing to do other than watch a movie, it will not look too bad. 4/10
