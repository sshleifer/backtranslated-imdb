I've seen poor movies in my time, but this really takes the cookie! Why oh why this movie was made? There's nothing here. Please put your trust in me, push the switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a plot ... which can take about 5 minutes to be displayed on the camera. This is the key problem, the story 'based on a true story' (mmm ... whatever) does not fit to be filled for 80 minutes. And so we have to spend more than an hour watching people walk around. It is! In the first half hour, absolutely nothing happens, besides seeing someone go to a store ... and then 3 guys walking through a forest. This time could have been spent on character development ... but no. And then there's absolutely no connection to the people on the screen, and then when they start getting shot, we could not care less! In fact, I was at the end assuring the villain so the movie would end! Also, the camera job is really awful! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West is trash. I hate hitting a guy, but really, your job is pants! These continuous close-ups, and then long singles, take people as they walk - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so monotonous that I just wanted to stop the movie and cut my wrists! How this man was hired to direct the next movie Cabin Fever is beyond me! Finally, the acting is also regrettable, which is true for the film as a whole. Preserve your sanity, stay away from this whole lot of excrement!
