I can not believe that in the previous 34 reviews, no one has mentioned that this movie is a cheeky steal from Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring a ostensibly dumb blonde to the demands of a gangster. Lean gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is left in the hand. But Born Yesterday was a clever treatment, meanwhile it's just so much more. Transfer Technicolor to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus would be rolling in her grave. Check out the paperboy. Do you recognize him? But historically, it's interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is the introduction of Ewell to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
