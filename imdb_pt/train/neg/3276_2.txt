The 1980s TV show, updated with fresh female flesh and raunchy language. "The Dukes of Hazzard" passed by me; was not repeated whenever I was in front of the television in New York or in California; or, I probably would have watched. Still, from somewhere (like the clips accompanying the upcoming movie release in 2005), I knew it was about a fast, orange Dodge Charger - and, "General Lee" is still good. <br /> <br /> Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (like Bo and Luke Duke) are the New Knights of the Orange Sage. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (like Daisy) fills her well short - but even her pink bikini can not beat the competition of a dorm full of bouncy and topless coyotes. The very stupid plot involves a gray-haired Burt Reynolds (like "Boss" Hogg) threatening to turn Hazzard County into a strip mine. <br /> <br /> The Dukes of Hazzard (7/27/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
