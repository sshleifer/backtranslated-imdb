While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells can be intriguing, the execution is frankly pathetic. I do not even know where to start since I have so much trouble with this movie. I suppose I'll just number a few of them: 1. The acting ?? When you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure and Susan George (and their teeth) are the stars of your movie, you know you're in trouble? Not that this is very important to me, but those names are hardly List-A's. Susan George may have been in some of the movies I like, but I've never considered her the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this movie, his acting is embarrassing. As for the other two, the less said the better. <br /> <br /> 2. The ghosts ?? The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me a bit of the ghosts on the stroll of the haunted mansion. At Disney World. And they're so scary. And why do they have to be so obvious? Subtlety is not a feature of the House where evil dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How predictable can a movie be? The result of this film is painfully obvious when you meet the three main characters. If you can not see where this movie went after 15 minutes, you need to watch more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. The Convenient Priest What are the chances that the haunted house you buy is just across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and approaches, knocks on the door and asks if you need help removing the evil spirits. Nonsense is a word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Everything else ?? It is very hard for me to think of anything positive to write about. I suppose I'll give a point to the opening scene and a point to the architecture of the house. Is that a sure sign of a winner? noting the architecture as a highlight of any movie does not say much about the actual movie. <br /> <br /> I'll stop. You should be able to get the idea of ​​what I already mentioned. And I did not even mention the boring girl or the Invasion of the Crabs or a myriad of other problems. Be warned, this thing is horrible.
