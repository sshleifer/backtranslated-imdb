I'm amazed at the positive comments for this completely uninspired movie. Often with foreign films I skip criticisms that complain of a slow pace and seeming "absence of action" as many of the best international films do not. live according to the Hollywood narrative model of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I like the frequent cunning and lack of clich√© in the foreign film arena. I like that many foreign films do not hold things in a small palatable bow. <br /> <br /> That said, this particular movie offered no redeeming value for the time I spent watching it. No significant character development, no engaging story arc, no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on the screen. Synopsis: A bunch of emotionally immature bribed settlers mistreat their slaves, and a little girl is injured by her only friend when the "master of the house" finally fills up and takes her abuse out of it. . <br /> <br /> Although the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic, this movie will annoy you as you stage the setting. I was so uncommitted that it took three sessions to finish it, and I would not have done it were it not for the positive ratings. <br /> <br /> Unless you have an academic interest in the period, I strongly suggest avoiding this.
