** ATTENTION: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** If you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject, this movie offers a great help of outrageously exaggerated melodrama. Surprisingly, this movie has been copied and stolen several times over the years, although it is hard to imagine ANY filmmaker being inspired by this useless drama. None of Hemingway's women can act here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a lawyer, and Chris Sarandon is sometimes pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the grumpy grimace. > <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not make a silk purse with a nut script that is full of dialogues and strange situations. For example, the final sequence where Margaux picks up his shotgun and chases Sarandon after his last shocking act is meant to be exciting but evokes heartfelt laughter. Add a raucous and notoriously raucous soundtrack by Michel Polnareff and you will have a real guilty pleasure, even though you are likely to feel dirty and in need of a hot shower after watching it. Do not say you were not warned.
