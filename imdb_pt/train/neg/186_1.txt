I did not know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of Canadian history, particularly the disservice to the history of the Yukon Mounted Police. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it to Pierre Berton, noted historian, born and raised in Dawson City Yukon, and author of the definitive history of the Klondike gold rush, Klondike: The Last Great Gold Rush, 1896-1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie: <br /> <br /> The American idea of ​​an indomitable frontier, subdued by individual heroes armed with six guns, continued in The Far Country, another story about a cowboy from the American West - this time Wyoming - leading his herd of cattle to a country of gold. The image is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but is true incongruity the main assumption on which the plot revolves? that there was only one policeman mounted all over the Canadian Yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with illegality. When James Stewart and Walter Brennan arrive at the Yukon border with their cattle, the customs hut is empty. <br /> <br /> "Where's the cop?" asks Brennan. "In front of Pelly River. Chilkat problems," someone responds. He has a very hard job, that one He patrols about ten or twenty thousand square kilometers. Sometimes he does not come home for two or three months at a time. " <br /> <br /> The historical truth is that the Yukon Territory during the gold rush was the closest to a police state that British North America has ever seen. The Northwest Mounted Police were stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before Klondike's attack. They controlled all the routes to the Yukon and did not admit nonsense. They collected customs duties, often on the cries of newcomers, made arbitrary laws on the spot on river shipping, and returned the men if they did not have enough supplies, or if they just looked bad. In true Canadian fashion, they have established moral laws for the community. In Dawson, the Law of the Sabbath was strictly observed; was a crime punishable by a fine to cut his wood on Sunday; and plump young women were arrested because of what the stern-faced police called "a spicy performance in the theater," generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on stage in over-revealing pants. <br /> <br /> In such a community, a gun belt was unthinkable. A notorious Evil Tombstone man who tried to wield a gun on his hip was personally disarmed by a young policeman who had just expelled him from a hall for the heinous crime of speaking too loudly. The bad man came out like a lamb, but he protested when the policeman, finding that he was carrying a weapon, told him to hand him over. "No man has yet taken a weapon away from me," said the American. "Well, I'm taking it," the cop said gently and did so, no more resistance. So many revolvers were confiscated in Dawson that were auctioned by the police for a dollar and bought as souvenirs to stay in the mantelpiece. <br /> <br /> In 1898, the great year of the riot, was not there a serious crime? much less a murder? in Dawson. The contrast with Skagway on the American side, which was a lawless city run by Soapy Smith, Denver's trusted man, was remarkable. But in The Far Country Dawson is seen as a lawless community, which a Soapy Smith character from Skagway? Is he called Gannon in the picture? can control easily. (In real life, one of Smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was again attacked by a mounted police sergeant). In the movie, the lonely Mountie says "Yes, I am the law." I represent the law in the Yukon Territory, about fifty thousand square miles from it. <br /> <br /> "So why are not there more of you?" <br /> <br /> "Because yesterday it was a desert. <br /> <br /> We did not expect you to enter the thousands. <br /> <br /> Now that you're here, we'll protect you." <br /> <br /> "When?" <br /> <br /> "There will be a post set up here in Dawson in early May." <br /> <br /> "What happens between now and May Are you going to be here to keep order? "<br /> <br />" Part of the time. "<br /> <br />" What about the rest of the time? "<br /> <br /> "Choose a good man. Swear He makes you act like a marshal?" <br /> <br /> The film that Mountie leaves and does not appear again in the photo. Your surprising suggestion? that a marshal of the American city, complete with tin star, be sworn in by a group of people of the city who live under British jurisprudence? is accepted. Of course they want to make Jimmy Stewart the Marshal; it clearly fits the part. But Stewart is playing the role of Solitary who takes care of Number One and so another man is elected to take a shot. And it does. Others get shot. Even Walter Brennan is shot. Stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he should finish all filming with some footage of his own. He holds the tin star and he and the bully, Gannon, stop in the inevitable western climax. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a passing knowledge of northern Canada, this bald retelling of history passes through rational belief. <br /> <br /> Excerpt from Hollywood's Canada, by Pierre Berton, 1975.
