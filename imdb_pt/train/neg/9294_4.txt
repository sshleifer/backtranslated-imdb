As someone who was impressed by the incredible visuals of "Hero", I was eager to see this movie, which was advertised as being on the same line, but better. He also featured an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed in both accounts. I bought the DVD of this movie without being seen, and that was a mistake. It was not better. <br /> <br /> I realize that these martial arts movies that fly through the air are pure fantasy, but this story is so far beyond anything remotely believable that it just made me nod in disbelief. . A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? Sorry, this is going a little far. In addition, the main male character 'Jin' (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialogue, stupid look on his face and stupid laughter that he ruined the movie too. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderful colors and incredible action scenes, this story - to me - simply did not have an appeal to make it a movie worthy of ownership. This movie is not a "hero" of mine!
