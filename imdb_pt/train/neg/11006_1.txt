This film stars, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not exactly names that shout "quality." And with such uplifting sketches as "Supermodels taking a dump" (that's exactly what it looks like), a guy who steals a sperm bank (the "Rhymer"), necrophilia with a corpse rotting, black market fetuses are supposed to be one pot), lots and lots of gay jokes, a sketch on a giant phallus that is a superhero and forced abortions. The sketches are painlessly dull (like "Batman and Rhymer"), the acting is not good enough to be considered amateur and the film is rude just because it's gross ... and stupid. I truly believe that a group of 8 year olds could have made a funniest film with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this film resulted in a Vince Slap Shot process against the Scientologists. Frankly, I do not know who to cheer for this case !!! Apparently, he claimed that somehow, the Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank that film. It does not matter that the film is garbage repulsive from beginning to end and 99% bland (in comparison, Ebola is funnier) ... and these are the coolest things I can say about the film. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lee (of "Mad TV") is wearing a diaper and participating in the fake porn movie idiot. It is incredible that your career can overcome this.
