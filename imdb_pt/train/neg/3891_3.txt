I think my favorite part of this film, which exemplifies the sheer lack of sense, stupidity and inanity of the process, comes at the climax of the film. DOCTOR TED NELSON and his unmarried friend, the Sheriff, finally cornered the Melted Man on a landing on some stairs in an electric power plant. Keep in mind that Nelson has been looking for the MM for almost the entire movie, and that MM has killed and eaten several people at the moment (including his boss), and Nelson is very aware that MM is violently insane and hungry for humans. flesh and blood. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff has his gun pointed at MM, who he is, and I give the movie and Rick Baker sticks to it, the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form we've ever seen. And he shouts a very important question to DOCTOR TED NELSON: "WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera cuts to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it's obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently Ted was so preoccupied with the problem of finding the man that melts, that he never thought of bringing some restraint devices, tie, straitjacket, net, or some tranquilizing darts, or maybe a Vangelis New Age ribbon to calm the men. Wild beast. <br /> <br /> Then the sheriff panics and shoots, the Melted Man goes mad, and hilarity follows. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this explains why NASA has been around with the Space Shuttle program in sub lunar space for the past 30 years, instead of going back to the moon or to Mars, as everyone knows they should be doing. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is the kind of bad, lazy writing and directing that weakens every aspect of the movie. It's hard to say how good the actors really are, because the film has complete disregard for its characters. <br /> <br /> Two other incredibly painful sequences also increase the stupidity of the process: there is a scene that shows the heaviest old couple in the world trying to steal lemons from a grove, only to be ripped apart by the Melted Man. This scene is a nadir in the movies of the 70s. I can guarantee that you have never watched a more useless and annoying installation with strange-looking people in your whole life. And the Melt attack on the lady who lives in the house where they keep a horse pissing on the walls defies all attempts to sue him. (BTW, I think famous film director Jonathon Demme has a part in this scene as the hicky husband who first comes in to check the house and never goes out again). The only thing that prevents the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as I said, the horse apparently peed on it. And we are forced to see her hysterical for at least two more minutes than any SANE filmmaker would do. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should end up with the IMM director and photographer. I remember him from an old episode of Columbus, where he looked MUCH better than him here - no one's idea of ​​a protagonist, but solid and unobtrusive. But no one could be so unpleasant in real life as his director makes him look here. <br /> <br /> Everyone else comes out a little better except for the old couple (and shut up, I know they were being thrown to laugh, but I'm not laughing!), but not much. <br /> <br /> This definitely fits into the 'So Bad You Can not Flee' category of movie disasters. Still, I watched it again before attending many other abortions of the 70s and 80s ("Track of the Moonbeast" and "It Lives By Night" come to mind), and the coverage of the MST is a lot of fun, so if you have a chance, watch the MST version.
