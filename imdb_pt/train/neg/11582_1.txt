I'm glad to see that most people here do not think much of this movie either. There are some big names in the cast, but that's it. There is nothing to recommend except look at some beautiful women you can do in a thousand movies. <br /> <br /> History does not involve anything but unpleasant, egocentric characters, national film-critical smokers seem to like it ... and most of the public can not stand it. <br /> <br /> Oklahoma's accents are so fake that they are laughable, the racist stereotypes of the South are good at Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
