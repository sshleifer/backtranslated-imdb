The first movie is very good. This is too bad. <br /> <br /> Recycle many scenes (including opening credits and final title) from Criminally Insane. The new footage, recorded on video, really stands out as poorly made. The scenes do not have adequate lighting, the sound is sometimes almost inaudible, there are even video glitches like the image rolling and so on. <br /> <br /> Like all bad sequels, basically repeats the story of the first. Ethel kills everyone who shares her living space, often for reasons that have to do with them getting in the way of the food she wants. <br /> <br /> At least it's just an extra on the DVD for the first, which also includes the film from the same director Satan's Black Wedding. Too bad it does not include Death Nurse movies.
