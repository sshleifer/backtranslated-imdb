I saw most episodes of RMFTM as a teenager at "Cliffhanger Theater," which ran after midnight at a local station a few years ago, and then when Mystery Science Theater criticized it in the early 1990s. It was good for that. <br /> <br /> I can certainly make compromises for special effects, which were quite impressive for a low-budget 50's show (IMO Commando Cody flying scenes were better than George Reeves / Superman's in your TV show). And I can also make concessions for ahem, "to act" and fight choreography. except for the guy who plays the ruler of the Moon Men. He's incredibly mischievous. He looks and acts like the guy who comes to fix his plumbing, not the despotic ruler of an alien race. Even the corny dialogue works well - everyone goes out of their lines like wires of fireworks, no time lost or pauses for things like "thinking" or "introspection." As everyone does this, the viewer considers it immersive after some time, and even to my modern sensibilities, this does not bother much. <br /> <br /> What really pisses me off is writing and plotting. I'm not talking about sunny weather on the moon, or baking soda rockets, or a flight suit that has controls labeled "up / down" and "fast / slow." I'm not even bothered by the tackiness of the resolutions for the cliffhangers that end each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our so-called heroes are dumber than seals and have no cumulative memory. And because even though the dialog box is nailed like an express train, the plot goes through the same movements over and over again. Commando Cody and his friend are the spearheads of a secret high-tech science lab charged with protecting Earth (or at least the US) against an insidious alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security posts. They do not even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys walk RIGHT ON and hit the crap out of Cody and his staff ... not once (maybe understandable) but VARIOUS times. They even kidnap their female assistant on the second try. And they never get smarter. To further prove my point, let me point out how Cody jumps on his flying suit and flies around in trouble and never seems to succeed in catching someone. He does it over and over and over. Cody also flies with her ship to the Moon (the woman's assistant comes along to cook), stays for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and back. Cody catches one of Atomic Ray's weapons ... and immediately loses it to the bad guys again, because he did not bother locking her up. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you would think that if Cody's efforts were vital to save the US from the Moon Men, he could ask for some soldiers with carbines, some helicopters, and a tank or two to support him in instead of just working with the local police all the time. This should be a military operation, but they act as if it were another episode of "Gangbusters." <br /> <br /> It's all very hard to bear. I appreciate that the creators have been severely limited within their history by budget and time constraints ... and I appreciate that Cody is actually a fairly difficult man (even though he loses half his fights). But I can not stop screaming "DOOR! BLOCK THE DOOOOR !!" when the gangsters simply enter their laboratory, or try to blow up the ship and there are NO safety precautions at the landing site ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> Still, fine. Of the three Republic serials I watched, "Phantom Creeps" had a better storyline, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (hah!) And a better hero than "Radar Men", but it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why "Radar" men? They did not use the radar, they used Atomic Ray Guns. Should not the title have been "Atomic Ray Gun Men From the Moon?"
