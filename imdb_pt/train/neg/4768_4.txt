I stumbled onto Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews thinking that I could handle a medium movie. This film, however, was a little below average, still watchable. The script was poorly written and the acting was on average for a level B movie with a couple standing out as very good. The plot borders on Saw's, teaches people what they did wrong in a situation and tries to make them appreciate life more, but that's where the comparison ends. Nine dead try to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main flaw I found in nine dead was the slap in the face of the viewer of the flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes earlier in the movie and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate end that people will not see coming in a bad way. Except for the spoilers, I saw the worst of the bad movies and neither did they end badly. Decent movie, bad acting and ending though ...
