Predictable, told a thousand times with the usual drama, two half-hearted sex scenes mixed with some paranoia of characters, 70's violin style incidental music that is comical at times, I could not help laughing at myself. <br /> I usually like Defoe, and it has to be said that acting is not so bad, the "plot" develops at a reasonable pace and makes him guess from time to time. It's just that it's all very predictable, I felt like I was watching a TV drama instead of a new movie. Maybe that's the style the directors wanted, but it has to be said that the review I read here before seeing the movie could only have been written by someone involved in their production. <br /> <br /> Do not wait too long, and if I could delay the clock, I would not have gone to see the movies. I'd wait for the bargain boxes in your video store, I'm sure it will not be long.
