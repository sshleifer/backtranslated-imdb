As a mother of two small children who are or should say that they have grown up with the many reincarnations of Scooby I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If as a family we did not see any episode before Sausage and Scooby got a clue that we may have enjoyed it as a lightweight, no cartoon on a special Saturday morning. But this in essence is the problem that is in its current form so light it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and gang. I am sure I can succeed in a quick monetary return, but I am sure that the long-term purchase of old and young is in real danger of getting lost. My 6 year old son upon seeing the new version was really unhappy and without any notice he said he looked very badly excited and why it was nothing like the last installment (Where are you). <br /> <br /> Scrappy Doo was an anomaly, but still infinitely better than that. Let's hope Getting a clue will be on the producers' side.
