What is it? A Canadian produced zombie movie that I've never heard of before. A funeral parlor works on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows for an extended flashback that shows how the guy got there. Basically, he and his friends went to a graveyard on Friday the 13th and resurrected the dead thanks to their silly singing. Cut back to the morgue, where our corpse comes to life and kills the undertaker and owner (who gets his eyes out). The end of WTF? shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and shouting, "I'm not crazy!" Incredibly, he has his eyes behind him. <br /> <br /> With just 58 minutes, this is certainly one of the quirks of zombie cinema. It seems a lot longer, but put me in some kind of trance where I could not stop watching. The movie also has one of those "if you see this image, move away from the screen" gags. Is it the image of a sick old man in a theater (prophetic?) And when he appears (only twice) the blood begins to flow. The scenes are pretty damn for the time period. There is a big gaffe where a zombie cuts a girl's right hand with a shovel, but - when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to bite - it's a left hand.
