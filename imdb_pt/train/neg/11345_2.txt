I mean the word "pedestrian." It seems that the producers of the film have forgotten that something interesting has happened. Faith Domergue can do better than that. She is supposed to be the mysterious and vindictive Cobra goddess, torn by love for Marshall Thompson (is there an idea, huh?). Instead, she's a regular housewife in the fifties, and the simple, flat expression she uses throughout the movie makes me think they filmed everything early in the morning before Faith had her coffee. As for the rest of the cast, everyone is so sincerely "all-American" that the result is laughable. This is the most productively covered land in Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think "Cult of the Cobra" should really be titled "Cult of the Compulsory Obligation." Why would more such talented people dream of a slow, predictable derivative failure like this?
