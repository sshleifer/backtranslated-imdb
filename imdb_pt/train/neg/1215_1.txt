I do not usually do star ratings, but the computer does not let me do negative numbers. <br /> <br /> Initial headlines tell us that we are already in deep water. Although it is a low-budget film, 17 producers are credited. No. No. Early in the story, abusive husband Kenneth comes home to his family in a high-end gated community. The house is a stye. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) let the children run all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We're already in deep water. Basinger was 55 when the movie was released. Are these your children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della heads for the mall, a long scene that could have been cut. To beat up the idea of ​​unbridled eeeeeeevil male aggression in the universe, she passes football players in full uniform, pouring down torrential rain on Christmas Eve. Right. For a bonus she sees a vehicle with a deer drawn to it. <br /> <br /> We have a real thriller in the directing scenes, though. It is raining and the traffic is bad. First, we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then, later, Della tries to drive and talk at the same time on her cell phone, at some point, turning completely to check the messy rear seat of the phone charger. <br /> <br /> She wanders around the mall, sees an old friend from college, tries to buy things, but her credit card is declined - dammit, maybe her husband is in a bad mood because he's broke, but that's very complicated for the script to follow. <br /> <br /> In the lot parking lot it conflicts with the most ridiculous gang in film history. A white boy (Lukas Hass watching his career go to the bathroom), a Negro, an Asian and a Hispanic. Imagine an Up with People going bad and you'll get the idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a gun, it gives them attitude. A mall cop arrives to investigate the riot and they shoot him in the head, firing more than once. The parking lot is packed as can be, people everywhere, and no one notices. <br /> <br /> Della escapes in her car and instead of choosing a police station or well-lit secure area, she drives to a construction site where she kills all four evil boys one at a time, simply with the tools (literally) at hand. MAJOR marauder at the front. <br /> <br /> She drives back home. The car goes out and she walks in the pouring rain. Checks the kids down the stairs, and when her husband petulantly asks what she got in the mall, shows the gun and shoots at him. <br /> <br /> Experience with the four punks should result in personal empowerment for Della. Instead, we know that your children are likely to spend Christmas at an orphanage or a group home because the state will pick them up while she responds to murder an indictment. The four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self-defense. Husband, different story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I saw it on cable. If I had seen it in a theater (would it have been released sometime?) I would be furious. As it is, I'm sad to see talents like Mrs. Basinger and Mr. Haas getting wasted with rubbish like that. <br /> <br /> A very good thing, though. This was written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs. Montford has not gotten another copywriting or credit bureau since she passed this crap. There is justice in the world.
