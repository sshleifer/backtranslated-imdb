Raymond Burr acts as a lawyer involved in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his affection for the wife of his friend (Angela Lansbury). This was a whole year before he started making Perry Mason, so the film may be of particular interest to his fans whether it was the inspiration for his cast. <br /> <br /> There is not much else here that is interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but his character here is very one-dimensional and the motives of his crime in the mystery are totally obvious. There is an interesting performance of Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also in love with the "femme fatale", but the Burr character is quite straightforward. It's frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his hesitant delivery does not fit very well with his character, as in most movies I've seen him. There is no mystery at all. The whole suspense must be around the title of the film and the way Burr's character is setting up the character of Lansbury to get involved (the double risk prevents her from being tried again for the original murder, presumably). He does this with a very large tape recorder she does not notice when she walks into the room, I guess. <br /> <br /> A few moments, maybe unintentionally fun and basically the rest of the thing could have been done by TV.
