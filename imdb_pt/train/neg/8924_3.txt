It was a disappointment to watch this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the uneven script. <br /> <br /> Although part of it is spirited and modern, some of it is monotonous, bland and lifeless. Many of the jokes just stay there, without sparks and energy. <br /> <br /> From the cast, Mae West and Rachel Welch get along. Roger Herren in the role of Rusty shines (pity he did not make more movies). But for my money, there's a lot of John Huston, and poor Rex Reed hardly has a chance to fight. His character seems relegated to being sideways, wondering what he is doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> The low user rating should give an idea of ​​the public's opinion about this piece. The Vidal original provided a lot of potential that was virtually wasted. Not even the classic movie clips did much. In short, a rather secondary effort and probably will not be much better over time.
