As a true fan of Elvis, this film is a total embarrassment and the script is a disaster. The movie opens with the beautiful son "Stay Away" and the scenery of the Grand Canyon gives the viewer the hope of something special. Elvis comes on the scene and his talent is wasted in much of the time, especially in the rest of the songs featured. I've sat in this movie twice, just to make sure it's a piece of crap !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
