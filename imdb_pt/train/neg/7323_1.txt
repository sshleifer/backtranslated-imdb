Well ....... in contrast to other reviews written earlier, I must say the only good thing about this movie is the fact that a guy looked a bit like Jason Donavon, which reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how he won any awards, and although I'm sure a lot of effort was made, it was all fruitless, since the end result is one that screams foreign soap operas in the early 90's. The plot was non-existent, cinematography was desperate and the performance was on par with a level performance. It was sadly long and the sub-scenarios were incredibly unrealistic .... for example .... if your best friend slept with your ex boyfriend for 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken you would not be all the better of friends. It was all fantasy. That is all! Oh yeah, and the odd indie of the 90's house / soft core was numbing!
