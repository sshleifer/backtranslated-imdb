"The return of Chandu" is remarkable, if one may say so, by the cast of Bela Lugosi as the hero, and not as the villain. Because he even gets the girl. <br /> <br /> History as such involves Ubasti's Cult of Black Magic attempting to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the delightful Maria Alba) and use it as a sacrifice as a means of reviving her former leader who seems to be Nadji. Lugosi as Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to thwart the villains. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive footage. King Kong fans (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong at bay in various scenes. The acting is for the most part horrible. The actor who plays the high priest (I believe in Lucien Prival), for example, uses this performance-inspired pronunciation that was so common in early talkies. The less we talk about each other, the better. <br /> <br /> It is a mystery why Lugosi had accepted parts of independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a profitable star at Universal right now. Maybe it was because in this case he managed to play the hero and get the girl, who knows. As his career began to fall down in the late 1930s, such a fare would become the norm for Lugosi and not the exception. <br /> <br />
