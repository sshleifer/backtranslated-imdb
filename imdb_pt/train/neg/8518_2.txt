I'm amazed at how many comments on this show are about how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's unreasonably large. The acting is to chew the stage with enthusiasm and the plots have holes that you could drive a truck. This is not what I call real. <br /> <br /> He's so sincere in his desire to be "relevant" that it just shows how Rob Thomas and his team are so far removed from reality. <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought it was at best a snooze-fest and at worst more than a little annoying. Kristen Bell looks like she may be a good actress, but it's hard to say with the over-the-top style of the whole show.
