Instills the intellect of viewers with its simplistic lines. <br /> <br /> 3. The boy's slezy father is drawn almost directly from the Never Ending story 2. <br /> <br /> 4. In a world full of crime, disease, corruption, hunger and other problems that need to be addressed, only a losing team is worthy of divine intervention. * * * Did you know that angels do not like to swear?! Where the hell did that come from! <br /> <br /> 6.
