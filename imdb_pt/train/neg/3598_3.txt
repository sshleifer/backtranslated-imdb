Do you know when you look at your collection of old movies recorded on video and realize that there are some that you have seen only once or twice and can not remember if they are worth the time spent watching them? √Ålibi is / was one of those films; I met him, not long ago, and decided that I could give him a chance. I'm not sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the movie is very, very bad, on the other hand, now I have another free tape ... yes you understand. The plot is predictable and is by no means original. The pace is bad. The acting is bad, but this is not really surprising, since the two protagonists are former stars of the novel ... they are accustomed to exaggerate. The characters are poorly written cliches. The film even manages to spoil the easiest way to impress me (through the movies): court scenes. Even those do not provoke a single emotion for or against any of the fine cardboard characters. The film simply does not have real redeeming qualities ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is, it's so full of cliches that it's laughable. And that's the only thing that raises it above a 1/10 rating: the comic relief (albeit unintentionally) of the many cliches and stereotypes. I did not pay much attention to the movie, but almost every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh about. A final note: I considered using the line "Tori Spelling can not act" as a summary of a line, but I think everyone knows this, so I opted for the current one, since it is more informative. All in all, a completely bad movie, but not the worst, if you have nothing else to do and if it is on TV. Good for a few laughs if you can sit. 3/10
