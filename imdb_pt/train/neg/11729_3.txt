Virgin is chosen to marry a rich guy. Rich face, urine. Woman in boat like sailor. The sailor urinates. Virgin attends a communion dinner. Urine man at the dinner table. The barqueira takes the provocation to little boys. Man pretending to be baby urine. There is an underlying theme here. Makavejev is trying to say that he is in the world. To say that this is a bizarre movie is a euphemism. To justify the title, there is a scene in which Laure, who barely speaks ten lines throughout the film, bathes in chocolate syrup. It's a sweet scene, but the rest of the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth, unless you share the director's fetishes.
