'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a sequel made for television from the original film 'The Omen'. Instead of Satan owning the body of a little boy, he has the body of a little girl adopted by wealthy parents, who is bullied at school and ends up taking revenge on those who do evil. The movie seems to struggle with any horror factor, and many of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly scary, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan even with all the events surrounding her. I just did not find this movie too suspenseful or scary, particularly when compared to the original.
