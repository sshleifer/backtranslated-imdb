I heard that this movie was a lot more stylistic than the director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) had directed before, the problem is that it is possibly very stylistic. Basically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitary confinement, and within two years he throws lots of money. He's ready to take revenge on the jail-prone casino owner who sent Jake to prison, Dorothy 'Mr. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, doctors tell Jake that he has three days to live while dying of a rare blood disorder, and Macha attacks him. Loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) are demanding that Jake pay his money back and do some occasional work for them. The movie is full of Jake narrating through some flashbacks, and through his last three days before coming to the big revelation about Zach and Avi, and Macha, well, I suppose that's what it was. Also starring Terence Maynard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. They are sequences that involve a bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different perspectives and changing the speed at times, and all of them are annoying to the point of confusion and boredom, becoming a silly police drama. Very poor!
