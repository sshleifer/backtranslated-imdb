Maaan, where I start with this horrible movie. Bad bad story telling. I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie. Namaste London was a nice film to be honest ... even the soundtrack was good. But in this my ... oh my good ... for a movie that is supposedly musical ... the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman should have been the music director. <br /> <br /> Given two great actors, a much better job should have been done by the director. Even if the first half sucks, the last 30 minutes of the movie are OK. Performances by Salman and Ajay save the film from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> See if you have nothing better to do. The last good Bollywood movie I watched (and I watch a bunch of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
