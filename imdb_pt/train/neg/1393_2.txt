I thought watching employment videos about corporate compliance was tedious. This movie was not fast at all. What could have been a half-obscure half-hour episode has turned into a seemingly endless waste of film about people parking their cars, a photo of a guy's pool (he really needs to answer his phone, by the way) a dot matrix printer doing his work, and Heuy and Louey sitting in a yellow-lit control room repeating "T minus 10 and counting" as if something exciting happened. This is not how you do not expect it. The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC in something other than famous TV personalities, and this is reaching out to find something good. And DO NOT make me start music that was totally made up of a Tympani, some great marine mammals and microphone feedback. This movie is the closest I've ever had one, but it gets to 2 because I actually got to finish the insomnia cure, and I did not have to get out in the middle. AVOID ALL COSTS.
