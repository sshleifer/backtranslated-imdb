Rebar is an astronaut who is going to the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course this is a horror movie, things get ugly and he returns to Earth as the only survivor. Hit with some bizarre condition that causes him to slowly melt and lose his mind unless he regularly consumes human flesh, he kills what is apparently the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the nearby town to chase after more victims. <br /> I liked the premise and the monstrous and bloody effects are actually very good, but the space scenes are just glued out of stock. Images of NASA and the hospital look curiously like a warehouse. A very weak script, the development of a small character and a poor performance usually prevent this is another mediocre slasher film, with the novelty of having a live candle as a killer, and more or less, has its bloody effects interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, strictly for the most fanciful fans of monster movies.
