The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really dictate the direction of the film. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy who lives in New York in the 1950s. He has a burning desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, your mother and stepfather of course! What a pleasure. Unfortunately for Lenny, he gets caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife having sex. However, the wife is pregnant and they are not sleeping together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their free time hanging around some girls. They have a small club where all they do is sit and talk about sex. The problem is ... it's not done in an innocent and charming 1950s way. I'm not a puritan by any means, but I found it very disturbing to hear these kids talk about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. This type of rawness may work on a movie like "Kids" (1995), but in this movie it seems perverted. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is totally wasted here as Hedy, an old model of bra that becomes the object of the carnal desires of Lenny. Jason Alexander needs to stay as far away from the director's chair as possible. "For better or worse" (1996) was horrible and now this. What a waste. 1/10
