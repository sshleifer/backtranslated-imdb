* Possible Spoiler * 'Return to the Cottage by the Lake' is a useless movie. The performance was not good and the plot was by no means interesting. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by the Lake' is a good TV movie. The sequel was not. Judd Nelson was very good at the first film and put a lot more into his character than this. It seemed he was not interested in making the sequel. His performance was good, but it could have been better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion they are not even worth mentioning. But I will. The character of Alison is not even shown in the first part of the film. Suddenly she is the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The paper did not make sense and should have been thought a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. His performance was well below expectations, and cast members should have looked for someone else, anyone else. The director, Mike, was a confused character. He seemed to have a purpose to be there, but it did not seem that his death was necessary. The performance for this role was good, nothing good, but better than Salem's. <br /> <br /> The plot was really bad if you think about it. Stanley, who is presumed dead, enters the set of 'Cabin by the Lake', the film based on his script. He stumbles upon the director and before long, the director is dead and Stanley is running the show. Yes, out of nowhere the staff will let this stranger into the scene and finish the movie without knowing anything about it. There are some murders, not much, and the ones that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set is electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character is chewed by a speedboat. And one gets entangled in a plant before drowning. These writers must have been hard to excite. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed with the filming of the movie. The way he shifted from a low to normal budget began to become very annoying. Besides, the new hut by the lake was poorly made. We are not shown, but only in some scenes, and the whole thing with the current in the basement was useless. Worked on the first movie just because we were shown the room much more, but it did not work in this. <br /> <br /> There were many characters in this sequence. All but a few had no reason to be there. The acting of the little that was shown was very bad and ... they just did not have a purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a sequence from where the first stopped. 'Hut by the lake' I can pick up, but this was not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this, and so should you. It is nothing like the first and was totally slow too. Nothing happened in the first hour and continued to crawl in the second. Not to mention that the writing was horrible. Put this on only if you need sleep aid. <br /> <br /> So we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well. By the way he speaks, it looks like there might be a third possible installment for a good movie by itself. Stop playing sequels and we can be okay! <br /> <br /> (The filmmakers did not realize they showed us how they filmed the scenes of the lake from the first?) They were all made in a tank.Never, never reveal the secrets of filming.) <br /> < br
