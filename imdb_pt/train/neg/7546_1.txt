I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he'd work on a movie like this. I could not believe the other reviews and I thought it should not be bad to watch it at least once ... but trust me, it is. <br /> <br /> I did not see the old movie. But why do they want to redo a movie like this? The basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is that it must have an extremely intelligent script or must be extremely graphic. This movie does not fit into any of these and just remains mute. I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point, but that never happens. <br /> <br /> So this movie is a big no for fans of horror movies and for Cage fans. You could probably appear on television.
