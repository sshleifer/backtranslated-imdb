All right, we all love daisy dukes, but what about this cast? Let's get started, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not a thing about this girl and Daisy was not an idiot! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to resembling the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed that Boss HOg was so loud. That was part of Boss Hog's humor was his size. Did they try someone like Danny Devito?!? Ok, now get this they released Jessica Simpson did someone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee !!!!!! Clearly these producers did not look at the appearance of the former cast members. The screens have never been present in the dukes !! This made the movie switch off from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs down.
