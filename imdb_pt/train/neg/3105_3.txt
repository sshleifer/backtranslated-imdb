I can not believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue like homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not make a comedy about really homeless people. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence in these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in the land of fantasy, so the only difference between them and us is that they do not eat so often. Brooks' movies have become increasingly worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
