we will value it. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: A useless script that was typed by non-intelligent people in front of typewriters a thousand times .. Pathetic action that is thwarted by history ... OK production value including good set / location and beautiful girl .. -rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the movie has no social message. is thought free ... but if I pretend to be 10 years old, and my IQ is 70. I feel the message is: do not be afraid to love? -retrato 0/10 <br /> <br /> objectionable things: nothing special, just the slight hedonic and arrogant attitude of the Jews that is presented by the writer / director. in general, good, nothing degenerate -8 / 10 <br /> <br /> overall rating is 4/10
