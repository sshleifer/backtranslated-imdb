I thought this movie had absolutely no morals. I mean, how would you feel if your fiance left you on your wedding day for your cousin ??? I would be heartbroken !! It's classified as a comedy, but I did not find it funny at all. I thought they just found cheap laughs and picked them up. I usually love Julie Stiles's movies, but that's an exception. Jason Lee stars in another shameful show, which again proves that decent class and morale are not relevant in today's society. I had a complete lack of taste and I despise movies like this. I understand that people will uphold this movie and it's moral because it's "Just a movie" but I still keep my mark that such bad behavior should not be allowed on screen. I'm not trying to say that if you liked this movie, you're a bad person, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and parts of this movie were nice, I'm just saying that in real life, people acting like the characters in this movie were doing is shameful.
