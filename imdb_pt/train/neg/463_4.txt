Blonde and Blonder was unfunny. Basically, it was a dumb and dumber girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used a lot of background noise and music. Too far away from a lot of noise and music if you ask me !!!! It starts immensely boring, and TOTALLY inane. It does not pick up pace anywhere anytime soon, and I was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense continued. Perhaps the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes . I found it a little fun and interesting as it was approaching the end, but that was the only part. Also, I could not help but like characters from Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard a little. Even though this movie did not get any laughs from me, kept my attention. I would not say to completely avoid this movie, but there are thousands of movies better for you to spend your time and money than Blonde and Blonder.
