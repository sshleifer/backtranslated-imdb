A well-intentioned film about Sonja Horowitz (Renee Zellweger), wife of the devout Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy. Mendel's brother, Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field where she is already a jewelry specialist. He also begins a case with her, and when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he abandons her and betrays her to the family, which prevents her. There is a subplot in which Sonja's dead brother talks to her and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman, but why is not clear. Much is unclear, unfortunately, including what is happening to Sonja, why does she tell the Rebbe that there is a fire within her and may not be of God, and what does that mean, and what does the magical beggar say to her means . To some extent, the story touches on the situation of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not exactly released. Nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race well thought out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the value of a good woman and is still the sour-bitch who quotes Sonja. Zellweger fights with the party; she is supposed to be a Midwestern Jew, and sometimes her accent is flat, and sometimes she is taken over by the distinctive sounds of Brooklyn. She's at her best when she's being tough and taking control, but in the end the movie is a mess.
