It's ok. to start, taxi driver is amazing. this, this is not taxi driver or amazing. what is is bad but I found it funny, which means he had some redeeming qualities. like the dialogue ... wow. there was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid, and the movie was lazy. there were some places where I thought the movie would plunge into taxi-type violence, which would have hit the message at the end of the movie in the head with much more force. I can not even believe that there are 20 other people who have seen this movie. Yes, it's worth watching if you're really bored and want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least try.
