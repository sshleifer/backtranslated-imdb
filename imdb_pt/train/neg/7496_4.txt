It's hard to put into words the almost boiling hatred I have of this movie. But I'll try: <br /> <br /> All the other words were swearing, the sex scenes were uncomfortable, the drugs were rampant, and the stereotypes were beyond the norm, if not offensive to Italian Americans. <br /> <br /> I am not saying that the acting was terrible because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. al, performed well. But ... almost all the characters in the movie I despised. Not since the Vanity Bonfire I did not like all the characters on the screen.
