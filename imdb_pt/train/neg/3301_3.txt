The standard procedure for Swedish films today seems to be to start throwing plausibility out the window and continue on that path for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another good example of a movie that makes very little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are being stolen by a highly efficient "military-style" gang of thieves. Two police officers begin investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it seems at first glance. <br /> <br /> As usual in Swedish films, the cast is made up mostly of the same people you've seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film of the last few years! But that's fine, since the Persbrandt is one of the few who stands solidly here (as he usually does). The problems with this movie usually revolve around the story itself. Firstly, the robberies look more like the background. On the contrary, this is yet another film about a young policewoman struggling to prove herself in a male world (as if this had not been done a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin). There is also a completely unbelievable twist near the end that seems as plausible as the Aliens land. But still, I think it was a pretty nice touch, considering I was half asleep right about then. He tempered things a bit (and actually saved the rating from falling one more step). <br /> <br /> In the end, the main problem is the same as with most other Swedish films of this type. Simply that the action and the suspense do not correspond to the standards that we are accustomed with other films of this type (mainly Hollywood). It looks cheap and quite weak in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting, and forget about trying to make the "Hollywood action light" as they do now. Because this becomes more of a forgettable endeavor of the Swedish film industry. I rate it 3/10.
