This movie is one of the most exclusive movies you have ever seen. However, this comes from the fact that you can not make heads or tails of this mess. It seems almost a series of challenges to determine whether or not you are willing to leave the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel scorned, you will come across this horrible movie and develop a real feeling of pity for the actors involved, they have all seen better days but then you realize they actually received a little money to do this and you will miss them as you already did for the movie. I can not go on enough about this horrible movie, it's almost something Ed Wood would have done, and in that case, it certainly would have been his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To begin with, you are forced to sit through a movie. When opening a dialogue of the type you have never seen / heard, this thing is five minutes long. In addition, it is narrated, as suggesting that the viewer can not read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the flood of terrible lines starts, it's like he's operating just to put lines in the movie poster slogan. Soon we meet with Stephen Dorff, who I usually like to do) and he does his best not to drown in it, but in the end he does. Then comes the final insult, Tara Reid playing a clever role, oh, help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets film roles, in my opinion, although she should stick to American pie-type movies. <br /> <br /> All in all, you might want to see this for yourself when it's released on video, I know I had fun with it, I mean, let's be honest here, sometimes it's comforting to revel in the of others.
