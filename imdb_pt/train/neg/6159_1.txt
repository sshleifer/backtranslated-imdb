Why did everyone who watched this movie feel it their responsibility to tell us whether or not they are fencers? This point is completely irrelevant to any argument to be made against this total dog from a movie. <br /> <br /> I think sports movies fall into two categories; well-made films about the human spirit and competitions, and 'For the Sword'. <br /> <br /> Honestly this movie could never decide what it wanted to be, a moving drama about trying to be its best in life, a charge of competitive motivation or a martial arts movie. In the end, he did not do any of those convincing or completely enough to make me take a little care of that. <br /> <br /> For the record, I'm also fencing instructor (and now I'm officially as bad as the rest). But putting bad fences in a movie is not bad automatically. I mean, look at Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, good movies, more fencing). I liked those movies. But when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason, people think it's just the purists who think it's a pointless effort. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any comment on the minor issue of fencing. . This is just a bad movie. In the end, this movie has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or movie buff or just anyone with a wrist and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie and I'm forced to think, `Man, I'd like to be watching the Mighty Ducks. I know it's time to get around the discussion with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there's anyone in the lobby who will somehow give me two hours of my life back.
