I rented this movie on DVD. I knew the film would not match what I had promised on the back of the case, but as soon as I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts very well, with the premise that snuff films are being broadcast by cable. However, the main character has nothing on it to make you feel sorry for her, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. There are many unanswered questions. There was a big scene at the end that totally caught me by surprise, but overall this is a very sub par movie, but I think it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
