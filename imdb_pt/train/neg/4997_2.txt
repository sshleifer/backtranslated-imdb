... but it certainly is not without merit. Screenwriter and director Preston Sturges is experiencing unusual kinematic effects in telling his stories, creating widely-designed but distinct characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogues. (No wonder the upcoming Coen brothers film is a tribute to Sturges.) <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that the plot is not there so far; lack of surprise, unexpected twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing. The coffee slogan is a bad thing to hang the plot, and the ending is completely predictable. Frank Capra does this kind of thing a lot better. <br /> <br /> If you're new to Preston Sturges, check out "The Lady Eve" or "Sullivan's Travels" or "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" first. If you have seen this, go ahead and watch this one.
