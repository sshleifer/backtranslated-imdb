First of all to get my own feelings out of the way, let me start by saying that I hate comedy calls where each character is written and interpreted as being so stupid that you hurt if they are all the result of inbreeding. <br /> Now I'm going to say this I've seen the first three American Pie movies and although they were not the most amazing movies I've ever seen, they were fine (and definitive masterpieces compared to the three "Americans" "). Pie Presents "movies", I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie? <br /> <br /> I also have some other questions. <br /> <br /> Thought this was an acceptable use of studio backgrounds and production features? <br /> <br /> Who approved the final script (and what was that person smoking when they approved it)? <br /> <br /> And lastly, because someone thought it deserved to be released in theaters, where the average cost of admission is between $ 10 and $ 15, depending on where you live, when you should have gone straight to the box discount on Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> There is so much wrong with this movie that I can not write a really comprehensive review of it as it would exceed the maximum number of words allowed in this forum so I'm going to touch on the biggest things wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The plot is generic and uninspired and stupid and the characters are as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing I can see wrong with this movie is While most of the cast does not has talent, there are names that will probably be forgotten in a few years, and the only big name in this film is Eugene Levy. who spends almost all the time he's on the screen with that knowing smile on his face that tells the viewer "I know that's not funny and I'm wasting my talents, but hey, I'm getting paid for it, who cares" he does not even try to make any of his funny jokes (he really deserves more than this crap). As I mentioned above, most of the rest of the cast is horrible, even though some of them have been featured on great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays character that is so unbearable and irritating (there are things he could teach tropical skin diseases) that you almost would like him to die a slow and painful death on the screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just sneaks around and wastes the talent that he has to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe the next movie in this series will be just a soft core porn with a story line so they can circumvent the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with vulgar nudity useless and uselessly offencive sexual content that should have earned the X rating (the ratings board must have been drunk or drugged when they reviewed this movie for their rating). <br /> <br /> Interestingly, twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven sent The Nightmare On Elm Street to MPAA for an opinion poll, they forced him to cut twenty-five seconds of filming (I believe it was part of a death scene that had a silicone mold of a breast in it) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no choice but to do it or the movie would not have been released, but this kind of unnecessarily offensive junk can get the R rating today because everything is done in the name of comedy, if this movie were a drama or horror movie with that kind of content, there would have been a huge smell on the content and it would have spawned the feared X rating. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really bothers me is writing, this movie is written to play as the wet dream of a twelve-year-old boy with an extremely hyperactive sexual imagination is quite youthful and unusually coarse, almost all the expository situations that are supposed to move the corpse th In this movie, a plot is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it a mile away and the so-called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes, no matter the often repulsive sex references and unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior. it looks like this movie was written by an incompetent first year in a low-income writing essay class. <br /> <br /> Time is enough to kill this series before it gets more stupid rude and offensive, this pie is full of road apples.
