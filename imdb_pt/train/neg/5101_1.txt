The only thing that occurred to me after watching this conversation was that I would never have the time I used to watch it, back. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn try to win what they must have been, then payments on a holiday home then stay tuned. Wood acting, poor special effects, the only comic highlight was while our alien hero was in female form and this ended as soon as she made her obligatory naked b-movie sex scene within 30 minutes in the movie. The opportunity to have done what could have been a decent movie disappears just as Nicole Eggbert locks the alien in a bar in 30 seconds, while the Police, Military and Joe do not care about the woman drinking coffee, not Use the cup handle and use four jumpers at one go. It must obviously be from another planet. Just where I wanted to be when the movie was on.
