The first point that draws attention to "For Ever Mozart" is the absence of a plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple, since there is no story, script, plot or anything else that can remember the minimal structure of a movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors in the film industry and this useless crap is among his most hermetic films. I believe that even he did not understand what this story is; but there are intellectuals who wonder to justify or explain this confusing movie, and it's funny to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Forever Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
