Please spare me those movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. Couple this with an empty script with an intense desire to be a brother Farrelly or Coen, and yet the life of yet another group of supposedly high school people depicting their Dawson Creek teenage angst complete with a GenXYZ soundtrack that they are regrettably trying to do the movie "look" cool, and we have an intense and painfully inept satire. <br /> <br /> This is not diluted "Ferris Bueller" ... I prefer to watch a change at the traffic light. <br /> <br /> Just one scene stands out as anywhere that's worth the price of admission: when the Betty Masked girls meet a friend Richard Nixon Masked. It's a surreal moment. Inestimable indeed. <br /> <br /> But for the rest, I'd rather have a toothache. At least I can apply some Benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
