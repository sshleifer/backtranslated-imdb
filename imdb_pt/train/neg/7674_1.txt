It is true that there are many movies far worse than this movie. This movie was not Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I've seen both .. twice), but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (yes, even this movie got over it). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars, it's so bad. Razzie awards lookout, your biggest competition has just hit the theaters. This movie that I'm talking about is of course, Alone in the Dark. I'll try to get you through a step-by-step process on why this movie was so bad. I'm going to start with what might have been the best part of this film (alongside the final credits, which played 'Wish I Had An Angel', the performance.) Christian Slater should be proud of himself even so he proved successfully that it is possible to act in a decent way in a movie worse than drinking antifreeze.To speak, it made me wonder why he just did not get off the set until midway. Maybe it was Stephen Dorff being in the movie also (someone he'd like him to be but fails to do) Tara Reid is a bad actress but good-looking and that's all that really matters in movies like these. That's not to say that acting was perfect, though , it was average, not good, and maybe the only thing in the movie is not good. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack - Except for 'Wish I Had An Angel', the soundtrack is useless and bad heavy medal being pumped to the ears of the spectators, perhaps to tell the terrible story (something that I'll get to soon). A long and very expensive 2-CD soundtrack is on sale for those who are musically challenged. <br/> <br/> The Directed Directed by Hollywood's favorite director, Uwe Ball, who brought us the classic House of the Dead. Saying "Yeah, movies can get totally bad and that's just the beginning of my deadly saga of horrible movies." At least they say it's directed by Uwe Ball. Without telling me I would have guessed that a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the film on pain of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder glued to a skateboard and pushed forward until it hit a wall. In scenes where the camera should stand still, it is constantly moving, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> The Production - Who on Earth is stupid enough to put money into this bomb? I pity the fool ... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad he or she has learned such a lesson to never put money in the trash worse than dog dung tied up in a bag. <br /> <br /> The Writing / Storyboard - Trying to analyze the story is more painful then putting an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I could with it soon after, but I I'll try. <br /> Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children go under scientific experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted (this is where it got so bad I started laughing out loud). So many years later, he's a paranoid detective. He is attacked by some zombie who can not be shot dead, kills and moves on with life. Later, he is attacked by a crazy looking monster and discovers secrets that no one else knows. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, very bad. The film expects to read about 10 minutes, which look like 100, of random text about a fake civilization called Abskani. The film is not going to take a turnaround after the other, more than the audience can handle, more than the audience wants to deal with, more than the audience could care. This plot is very bad that even Double Dragon does better. <br /> <br /> Overall, miss this movie. I gave a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is 0.
