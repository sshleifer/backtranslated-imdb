A bunch of women who can not act sit down, talk, smoke marijuana. They have another woman in a wheelchair who hide because she is deformed, and occasionally kill someone to feed that person with human flesh that really looks like some ham bought from the store, which they donned by threading on some plastic fingers. We do not see them killing anyone, suddenly there's a body on the floor, covered by a bloody sheet. I can no longer eat Spam coverage because of a leaf because of it. Just the thought of spam coverage by one sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic adjustment caused by the attempt to get through this whole movie. Occasionally, there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is "hunting" them torturing a guy he tied to a chair in the basement. Why he got this guy and how he is connected to Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of some "superhuman" face in panic. He puts blood and strikes through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is not even explained or even tied to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects without history. If you want to watch some boring people talk in a deep way about nothing while sitting and eating ham and smoking, then here are 90 minutes of that, because except for a scene where a girl does a hook in a corner and the one already mentioned Random scenes, absolutely NOTHING happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you can see them moving a few things, including deformed sister, when they move into their new apartment. It is one of the few times when they are not sitting on a couch or lying in bed.
