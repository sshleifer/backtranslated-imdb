In theory, 'Director's Comments' should have worked. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director who tells of his behind-the-scenes experiences. Among the programs he allegedly worked on are "Bonanza", "Flambards", "The Duchess of Duke Street" and "The Bounder". Your comments are by no means informative because of your habit of getting sidetracked. <br /> <br /> But, in practice, failed miserably. It's a joke show, and the joke is not particularly funny. The scripts are completely devoid of intelligence, and Bryden can not convince himself as an old man. Always stuck to anything amusing to say, which is like every five seconds, he emits a hissing chuckle. Instead of having fun with DeLane, you want to shoot him. If senile old people consider it hilarious, then this is for you. <br /> <br /> It did not help that the ridiculed programs were, with the exception of 'Mr & Mrs' and 'Crossroads', quite good. . For the joke to work, they needed to be really terrifying, like "Charlie's Angels," "OTT," "Telly Addicts," "Neighbors," and "New Faces." <br /> <br /> The show has plummeted time, fortunately we are spared the horror of future issues. Would not it be delightfully ironic if the 'Director's Comments' were ever the subject of a parody?
