I was able to handle only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget film. The most blatant absurdity was that while American prisoners in a North Korean prisoner of war camp are severely deprived of food and medicine, going without a shower, shaking in fragile and filthy parkas, and sleeping on the bare floor, and - let us not forget lasting torture - they always manage to wear impeccably combed hair. With the exception of a suitably austere Harry Morgan as Army Major, the cast and acting are simply terrible. Ronald Regan can not limit himself to portraying a single character and creates a schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. A predominantly Caucasian cast portraying North Korean field officers may have been forgivable, but when allegedly Russian police officers acting as advisers of the Koreans paraded wearing re-badged Nazi uniforms complete with culottes and baseball boots (obvious costume-department recycle of World War II) and speaking with accents like General Burkhalter of Hogan's Heroes, well, there are only six kinds of nonsense. Do not waste your time on this.
