I was interested in the subject, and only fans of Drew Barrymore's dance at David Letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it. OK, it shows some breasts (or maybe a double body). The plot is cut into pieces and the acting is horrible. Neither does lead have any material to work with, since the direction of the film leads nowhere. Do not waste your time. See Donnie Darko instead, if you want a scary movie of Drew Barrymore, and if you want to see another, skip this one and see Darko again. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well. See Charles Williams' novel "Descent Into Hell" for something worth considering. This is just an excuse to make a B movie go straight to the video and suck a little at people's lives from Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> What makes any of these people think that acting here was commendable? Give me some time.
