This is not cinema. It's not talent. It is not informative. It's not scary. It's no fun. Is nothing. <br /> <br /> I have this because my cousin says: "Devil! COOL!" Okay, right. The cool thing about this experience was the solitary fact that I did not buy, but I rented instead. <br /> <br /> It's filmed like a bad novel. Do not wait. Soap operas, at least look professional ... sorta. This one? It looks like it was filmed with someone's camcorder. It's awful! Miserable! It's sux. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is detestable! Who is this director anyway? I do not even care enough to look for him. It STINKS! The performances of these poor actors were a lot better than this fucking party deserves. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> This registers about 0.3 / 10 on the "A" scale of ... <br /> the Demon :.
