... This would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, OK, maybe tied up with Boogeyman then. Terrible, truly horrible. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and I could not get to know them! I honestly can not think of a good thing. So here are the worst points ... 1. THE ACTING 2. THE PLOT 3. The CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics ... seriously) 4. THE LOT 5. THE DIALOGUE is , finally ... 6. THE LOT There are so many unanswered questions, They did a 2:32-hour movie, so they realized they had not put Lex Luthor and Superman together in one scene and were forced to settle for the 3 minutes or did they really think that no one would notice that the main hero and the villain have less screen time together than the Superman's son and the henchman that he kills? <br /> <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why doctors do not ask, "What the hell do you want us to do?" "He's an alien f ***! We do not know anything about his anatomy!" <br /> <br /> What happened in the 5 years that Superman was forced to make the technology advance 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where did the people who wrote good reviews watch the same movie? <br /> <br /> And finally, why? Just because? <br /> <br /> BTW, for those of you wondering how Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, I think I've figured out ... <br /> <br /> ... since the superman is not affected by kryptonite until he sees something green on the rocks, it's clearly all in his head. so the mainland is just repressing his fear of the bright green rock ... or the writers are a bit of a jaded idiot, who did not think that was a pretty obvious mistake.
