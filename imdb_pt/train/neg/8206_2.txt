With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I hoped that this movie would be at least tolerable. It was not. After the first half hour, I watched the rest with the remote control in my hand, so that the accelerator was ready. So banal, so normal, you know what will happen in each scene. One can even predict the dialogue word for word. This is one of those movies that makes a scratch and says, "How was this movie made?" In an effort to say something positive, I will add that there are some slightly funky special effects. But overall, if you watched 5 science fiction movies, or are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
