In modern times, in Eastern Europe, life is difficult and, for young women, prostitution is one of the only career options and one of them is taken over reluctantly by Melania. She attracts the attention of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, paying more and more money for the time with her until he eventually wants to buy it openly. She has two pimps with different emotional attachments and she is usually passed on as a piece of baggage without her own feelings. However, we are in the territory of "modern art cinema," so conventions such as narrative structure, subject lighting can be seen, camera techniques that add rather than distracting action and a vaguely consistent plot can be abandoned. Most of the time I had no idea what was supposed to be happening and I rarely cared. People started leaving the show almost before the last stragglers arrived and I do not think I've ever seen so many people leave. <br /> <br /> Images are important to the director - the characters emerge or disappear slowly. on a dark screen, we have long, time-consuming photos of nothing in particular and a sex scene happens in infrared. In fact, for an unconventional film, the sex scenes were extraordinarily common; missionary positions among people naked in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related strangeness. But perhaps nowadays being common is unconventional. <br /> <br /> In general, almost entirely without merit. <br /> <br />
