Probably New Zealands worst movie ever made <br /> <br /> The jokes They are not funny. Used from other movies and simply tacky The acting is bad although there is a large cast <br /> <br /> The story is uninteresting and boring There's more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers type pizza as the acting Has Been doing 1,000 times before I watched it when it came on TV, but it was so annoying that I could only take 30 minutes of it. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, <br /> <br /> Watch the dry ink
