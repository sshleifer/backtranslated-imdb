When I finally had the opportunity to watch Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on an imported Japanese Region 2 DVD, I was impressed by how much fun this zombie epic is. The transfer is almost immaculate, as good as it will ever look unless Anchor Bay gets a handle on it. The gore really stands out as it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx. The sound is also fantastic. It's just dolby of 2 channels, but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really enjoy the playful music (actually a very good score), and sound effects effective, although cheap. It never seemed so good, and the excellent transfer increases the overall pleasure. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood flows in this movie, it's extremely brutal with shots exploding in the head, blowing up mega pimples full of pus, a cutlass in the throat of zombies, burnt ends of a woman (as it is that he did not burn the guy too?)), chewing gut, zombie babies and more. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly for fans of Zombie hardcore action, especially the Italian type. There are excellent scenarios and cinematography to be found, I think people do not give enough credit, If you see a clean copy, not some horrendous pirate copy, it is quite another experience entirely. <br /> <br /> This movie never opens for a second, and I realize that it is inconsistent, the dubbing is horrible, the acting is harsh, and the sense of irreverence is celebrated in style, but that is part of charm of her <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best horror movies ever made, you can not make such bad movie, so good, on purpose. It is an accidental genius of the highest order. If they played to laugh , would have been a disaster but they played straight as an arrow and the result is a great classic cult that nose in any and all traditional patterns of filming. <br /> <br /> Tons of action sequences, exotic locations, excellent set design, good scenery, sometimes gre in cinematography, wonderfully flamboyant acting, and inconsistent but still interesting plot, great makeup effects, beautiful women who can kick butt, excellent music and sometimes hilarious, sometimes scary, but always fun zombies. As you can go wrong with this movie, have it all, a cult classic that stands the test of time.
