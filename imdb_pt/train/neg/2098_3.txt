I was hoping for some kind of in-depth information about the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was some decent interview footage with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission, linked by a sensationalist sensationalist prediction of disasters in the worst tradition of TV production. <br /> <br /> If you could cut your voice and change the program's turn to a positive testimony of how people can overcome setbacks to reach an out-of-the-ordinary goal then it might have been great - but I feel I lost about 45 minutes of my life while watching a 60-minute program. I want those minutes back.
