At first glance, this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and thought-provoking. Of course, when something causes thought, it can be examined. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with unfounded insinuations and conclusions. The link that "What the Bleep ..." you would see between science and spirituality is not, in fact, rooted in science. The study of Transcendental Meditation mentioned in the film states that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a particular area, Washington D.C. in this case. In fact, the HRA (Homicide, rape, and robbery) crime rate was about 30 percent higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study. In fact, any claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been unmasked. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this movie is a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. Either way, I suggest you do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long and breathless movie about science that could provoke thoughts, you might consider Mindwalk (1990).
