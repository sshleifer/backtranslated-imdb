In the title, I write that the story is ridiculous. below I'll elaborate and tell you why, in my humble opinion, spoil this movie. <br /> <br /> Generate and the Danes are doing their job, and although it's not their best job, it's okay. The rest of the cast, however, is doing a very poor job. Remember, this is not totally the fault of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones who have characters that have the least space in the movie to really give some depth. All other characters have very little space in the movie to create any depth, or the character is so clichéd that no matter how much the actors try. <br /> <br /> The director has a bit of Se7en complex, but just looking in the direction, I think he does a good job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all, it's a bad movie script. The characters are superficial (except for the characters of Gere and Danes), the villains are clichés and the actions of the characters are totally unbelievable. In addition, writers should have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics for a hundred years. It's the kind of movie that says some criminals are still criminals, regardless of whether they paid the price society gave them. It is also the kind of film that says, albeit only between the lines, that any form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the film, all that is not sex in the missionary position for a couple is a sexual drift. <br /> <br /> So if you are going to film a school and need an example of a bad script, or if you are writing screenplays and want an ego boost. Look. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
