This movie always left an impression on me. I watched as a freshman at school and was alone at home that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor, being a big fan of "Brady Bunch". I also thought the role of Chuck Connor was horrendous and evil. However, this movie has had so much impact on me that I am now volunteering in the state prison for women doing Bible studies and religious cults and trying to change women's lives one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people watched this movie. None of my friends watched and my family is ignorant even today when I discuss this movie because they did not see it.
