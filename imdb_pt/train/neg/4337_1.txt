This is just a massacre of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the plot of the book. And there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter had seen the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) leaves prison at the beginning of the original. Here, Carlito retires with his wife in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail de Lorain, Ohio? In this installment, she is not mentioned, and Carlito retires and is presumably going to marry another girl. <br /> <br /> In addition, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a totally different character in this movie. He was Pachanga in the days of Pacino. Now he is Nacho Reyes, a murderer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes played a much bigger part in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but where did the character from Sean Comb come from? Also, I think this movie really masks the racial tensions in Harlem that Torres was writing. And the mob does not get the treatment they did in the book. They are also eliminated in this movie. But, magically, the Pleasant Avenue group is close by for the second movie. <br /> <br /> The book told a great story. This movie could have told a great story. This is just a big disappointment. Read the book. It is a better use of your time.
