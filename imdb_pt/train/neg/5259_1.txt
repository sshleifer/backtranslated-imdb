After I finished watching this movie, I was so upset I lost 2 hours of my life. It's 2 hours I'll never come back. Ugh When you start this, you might think "Wow, this is really good!" But make sure first impressions mean NOTHING. I was so excited about this movie until the dumbest end I've ever seen. This movie is simply pathetic. The acting is bland, the plot is anything but original and there's nothing special about it except that it's the WORST FILM EVER !!! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!! NOTICE!! DUMBEST MOVIE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE WEAK IF YOU ARE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE IN THIS !!! 1/10
