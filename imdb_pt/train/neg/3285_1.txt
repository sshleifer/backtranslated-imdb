When a film like "The Dukes of Hazzard" brings over $ 75 million, it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society. Either we're collectively too dumb to get away from the trash that way or maybe I just do not realize how many people this kind of unnecessary junk will attract. <br /> <br /> Hollywood had no incentive to do this. good movies, since if you put rubbish out, people will see it anyway, since there is nothing else on the screen. That's it. I left despite receiving a free movie pass. Dialogue could not be dumber. The acrobatics could not be more exaggerated and outrageous. Maybe this "bigger than great" image pleases the Texans, but it did not appeal to anyone in the theater. None of the "big names" were in this end-of-career film, except for Burt Reynolds, which tells you everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - Do not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I would not even recommend this movie for video, even if you were desperate. This was all about fooling the public to make enough money after the opening day to match or do better than it cost through marketing. They did it despite the public being forewarned. Stupidity is abundant.
