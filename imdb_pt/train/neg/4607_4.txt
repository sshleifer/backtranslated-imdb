You can not imagine how I expected the king of ants. As a big fan of Gordon, I waited for the European premiere with a perverse anticipation. Especially since I loved Dagon - Gordon's last conquest - so much. King of the Ants debuted here in my country and it was Gordon himself who introduced him. Unfortunately, I could not greet him after that. King of the Ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date. Indeed, the level of quality has never exceeded the common standards of TV thriller. The outline of the plot is terribly routine and, with the exception of some bad scenes, Gordon's typical touch is never recognized. Also, the already weak script has more holes than a bowl of Swiss cheese! It involves a young aspiring drug dealer hired to commit murder. So it does. And of course they are not paying him. And of course he falls in love with the victim's wife. And of course he gets revenge. Only the sequences in which the guy goes down in a spiral of madness are worth it. mention them and they're the ones that remind you of the fact that you're still watching a Stuart Gordon movie. Performance performances are below average, with McCenna as the heroic lowlife, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as the chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the good-hearted sex bomb. Extremely illogical things happen constantly and the blunting of the story becomes annoying very quickly, while the effects of makeup are not enough to satisfy amateur horror fans. I read some other comments about King of the Ants, claiming that it is Gordon's best because it is finally a thought-provoking and mature movie. Well, if that's the case. I'd rather get immature and give the Re-Animator another vision, thank you very much. Oh, well, I think every good director ends up losing his strength and inspiration. In addition, he also outperformed Stuart Gordon.
