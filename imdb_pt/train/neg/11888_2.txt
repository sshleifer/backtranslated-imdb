To make any movie about the supposed end of the world, there must be some facts and realism. 1. We are never told why these people believe this. 2. Location is New Year's Eve in Toronto, Canada. So please, somebody tell me why it was still glowing at midnight and why (based on the costumes) it looked similar to September 3. The acting was in that neo-au-natural style, which needed a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. The individual pieces of the story were sad and without any purpose. I could go on, but I do not want to make it as boring as the movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I am as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
