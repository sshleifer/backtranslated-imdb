There can be no spoiler questions for this movie, the director also beat us and spoiled this movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> A blatant departure from things like Critters and Gremlins, this movie fails on so many levels to recapture the mood and horror of those best-made movies. This ends up being a waste of time, where the bad actors deliver a bad dialogue in front of an idiot director, who occasionally throws plush toys at them. They fight with these toys in the same way that Tarzan's old movies used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them as they screamed and trying their best to look a bit threatening. It is painful to watch, and not helped by the 1980s mental fashion worn by the cast. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy aliens who have been arrested by an aging security guard in a lot of movies finally get free after many movies. years of confinement, and begin telepathically to fuck people's minds. The new recruits guards, the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings, join their gang of friends from the '80s and they go off and make little adventures together while trying to recapture the Grem ... Hobgoblins. <br /> <br /> All life is here, with the gang formed by an idiot athlete, his 80's vagabond girlfriend, the fragile and affected girlfriend of the hero, and the young hero, without trust and wishing his girlfriend anyway. <br /> <br /> First comes the infamous rake fight scene where the ex-military athlete shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully, nudging the nerd hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours . Then there are some running around, ending in a real pie fighting style, ending up in a noisy nightclub with comedy grenades blowing it all apart from the people standing next to them. So the sorta movie ends, and that's fine when it ends well. <br /> <br /> It is not. It's like watching a train accident, you can not take your eyes off it, it's so bad. Perfect food for Mystery Science Theater, but awful if you try to watch alone and uncut. The Fashion Police still have a number of pending warrants for the cast, and I dare someone not to laugh at any scorn in the rake fight. That marks 2 out of 10 at the most, on a good day.
