I saw this movie for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to take a very stupid movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot because he explains his disdain for all things Christian, but there was so much camp that this idea did not come to fruition as much as it could have been. I see this movie more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a path to the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the other 5 people who have seen this movie) that it still exists . I really liked the special features of the DVD more than the movie itself.
