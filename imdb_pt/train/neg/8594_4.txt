At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neil (Cillian Murphy) that she is constantly looking for an adventure. She said "because I have phobia of rubble". That means she can not really get on with her life by doing some mandatory activities. Well, I think her motive and the way this movie is ironic is very ironic. Because "Watching the Detectives" is a tedium of joy. <br /> <br /> Have any of these characters really made something exciting for the first time? Neil is a geek who runs his own video store. He and his other friends geeks usually go out to the store and watch movies together as they debate about them later. But Neil's life is completely transformed when Violet enters her store. She's an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. Anyway, after some dates, they decide to see each other. The problem is that Violet is a person who continues to make jokes about Neil and can not do something normal, while Neil is completely opposite of hers. The question is. Will they be in love in the end? You bet. <br /> <br /> "Watching the Detectives" is a romantic comedy cliche at its core. And they did even worse, pretending to be something else. From the first set, we know that Neil is a very laid-back guy who has not compromised himself with anything. And then, Violet comes on the scene, looking all weird and annoying. So at this point, we all know that we will sit in all senseless situations to find out how they will end up in the end. Is it worth the wait? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give something more to the audience. "Watching detectives" is trying to talk about compromise. Observe how far people go to achieve something they desire. In the end, we knew that the insane things that Violet did are all the evidence that Neil is ready to conquer her heart (or anything else). Well, I think it's completely bullshit. This movie will end very quickly if Neil says to himself: "Forget, this girl is crazy!" After collaborating with many great directors recently ("Sunshine" and "28 Days Later" by Danny Boyle, "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" by Ken Loach and "Breakfast on Pluto" by Neil Jordan), it's a pretty weird choice for Cillian Murphy to make a movie with one of Broken Lizard comedy troopers, Paul Soter. By all means, he's not bad (as usual), but such a talented actor like him should not be wasting his time in the movie like this. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly terrible as Violet. Your acting is a mess. I mean, it's everywhere and it's so exaggerated. Tony Montana would have been proud. <br /> <br /> The last but not the least mistake that the movie made is a completely irrelevant title. You simply can not really connect a point between the plot and its title; and then you will end up thinking that this does not make any sense. In short, "Watching the Detectives" is nice, if forgettable movie you may have the chance to get it on cable TV so fast you could not imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
