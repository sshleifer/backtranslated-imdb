This movie could have been really good, but it gets very short. Special effects of cheese and so on acting. I could have looked back if the story was not so bad. If there was one more background story, it would have been better. The plot revolves around a druid witch who is attached to this woman suffering from migraine. The movie drags on and never clearly explains anything, just keeps moving forward. Christopher Walken has a part, but it's completely meaningless, just like most of the movie. This movie had potential, but it seems like some really bad ones were made for TV movies. I would avoid this movie.
