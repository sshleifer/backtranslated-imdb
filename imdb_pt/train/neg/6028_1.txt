I'm a Christian ... and I feel like this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> No one but hard core, Bible Christians will like this movie. The message is very much in your face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be much more subtle. You can not have the father waving the Bible around and carrying it with him in every scene. RIDICULOUS! <br /> <br /> Bad direction. The revelation of the missing people should have been terrifying, but it was laughable. Do they leave their clothes on the floor? It reminded me of Ed Wood's old movies: "Oh my God! People are missing!" That scene on the plane is just stupid. Think about it: if you found your relative's clothes by your side, you would not just shout "oh my god." They disappeared! and start crying and screaming. You'd be first in denial ... you just would not jump to that conclusion. Watch Jodie Foster on FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is the dog sitting on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to it. I fell off the couch and was laughing so hard. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad and so disturbing. It was as if the composer were in his own world marking his own films. "here's my chance to make a thriller," "here's my chance to take action!" STOP TELL ME HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL! A good score supports what's happening on the screen ... this movie needed more than one UNDER score, but it was both in your face and in the message. <br /> <br /> The writing was bland. The same thing happened with Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was the worst: "you do not understand! People are missing!". Brad Johnson was laughable. The two performances stand out from Antichrist and the older guy (sorry, I can not remember their names). When watching the "making of" (to answer my question of "what were they thinking ???"), Producers, filmmakers and actors are saying "we're going to reach a big audience" and "Brad Johnson is amazing" and "this is like a Hollywood movie." I have come to the conclusion that they simply do not know what they are "doing". <br /> <br /> I recommend the effort. Getting the message out to a broad audience is a fantastic idea. The movie is the best way to do it. Look at movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION OF CHRIST, EVEN IF, WHERE DO YOU WORK? The bottom line is that the film needed to be done by people with talent and vision. Unfortunately, it was not.
