I'm sorry to say that, but "Thunderbirds" does not even come out with a loud snap, no matter the thunder. At one point, I seriously thought of leaving the movies, I hoped that the film could improve. I should be disappointed, not improved, worse if that's possible. If I had gone to see the movie with the thought that it would be a "parody," I would still be disappointed. They had a great opportunity to make a great film franchise here, they totally missed this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be ashamed to have the names attached to this film and Jonathan Frakes well what can I say, he should be ashamed and shame would not be far from the truth. I saw this movie in a pre-release view, I was hoping to see it more eagerly, having grown up in the 60's with the original shows. To say that I was disappointed would be a kind of euphemism. One last thing I'm going to say about the movie was that the dolls on the TV shows were a bit more wood than the actors in the movie.
