"Wild Tigers I know." That will only be appearing in big cities, for sure. It's one of those movies so artistic, it does not make any sense, except for the director! I hate those! And all these so artistic / alternative people desperately try to find "metaphors" in what is EVIDENT horseshit. <br /> <br /> There was no plot, no story, no morals, no chronology, and no fun or even playing. For me, it was a lot of scenes together that had nothing to do with each other, and they were all meant to "show" how "artistic" and "visual" they could be. It was an attempt at yet another movie of teen angst, but it missed the mark on all humanly possible levels. Then the credits roll! I was hoping for this to make sense! I was waiting for the "good part". I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called "house of art" films. That will not be between them. You will be very angry with yourself for paying to see this movie, much less buy it on DVD.
