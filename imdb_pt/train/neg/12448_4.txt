Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a western troupe, one of six common misadventures that make up a touring show. The seventh member of the pack is a woman, Billy's assistant, but these women never last long and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke's girlfriend Eastwood at the time). It seems that Ms. Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls her, is an alleged heiress who will only receive the inheritance of her long-dead father if she is married until she is 30, so on the eve of that birthday she is engaged. for the cartoon Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> So, what is the plot of this movie? It is hard to say. There's the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that in the first half of the movie she's so arrogant and detestable that when she suddenly becomes 'one of the troupes' in the middle of the movie, it's not just unbelievable, He's been worried about her. There is the chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show, but this topic is not addressed enough to really be the reason for the movie. There is Miss Lilly's predilection for being stuck in the rural west, cut from the backs that feed her spoiled luxury life (she mistakenly believes she is dead by her family and the press). But should we really believe she could not go back to New York and her expected fortune if she gave a little effort? <br /> <br /> No, the purpose of this film seems to be that Billy is the leader of a family, a lovely bunch of losers who co-exist in a thick and difficult way. Is this a hot and fuzzy movie? or at least try to be. Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a gun, even thwarting a bank robbery in a shootout that is grotesquely out of place in a relatively non-violent movie. One of the gangs is arrested by an old accusation of evasion; Billy bribes the local sheriff. The tent of the show is burnt; an orphanage makes them a new one. But numerous worldly traps do not make a plot. <br /> <br /> Composing the problem is the acting, or lack thereof. In addition to Scatman Crothers, the support cast is quite amateurish. Eastwood is not at the top of his game, although he looks better simply because he is surrounded by such a weak group. <br /> <br /> And for all that, the movie continues to run for 116 minutes. How far? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
