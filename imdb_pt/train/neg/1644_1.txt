Put down the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing would ever dethrone Last Action Hero, but this does easily. The film is about three unmarried guys who gather on Sundays to discuss their weekend sexual escapades. A fourth guy - who is married and - who used to be part of the group, appears and talks about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this movie. Jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the film. The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable. Avoid at all costs.
