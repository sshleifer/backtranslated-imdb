In fact, I had to stop him. Do not get me wrong, I love bad monster movies. But this was very annoying, regardless of the music of suspense that never takes anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she comes in contact with one of the beasts was an obvious clich√© too. This movie totally betrays the cover of the DVD, which seems quite interesting. From the hood you expect a giant monster, but you get those twists not as gigantic as the expected electric eels. I moved to watch another movie called The Killer Rats, but that's another review. Deep Shock was really crap, a great shame considering the fact that it seems very high budget.
