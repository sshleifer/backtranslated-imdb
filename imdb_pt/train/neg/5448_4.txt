Doris Day never lets a bad script take her down. Even under the most difficult circumstances, the Day gives 100% and usually goes unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a real-life black-out in New York in 1965, but actually adapted from a French play by Claude Magnier in the late 1950s, gives Doris little to do but fake her own image of mimosa. second semester, be comically sedated (which is fun because of spin day gives the situation). There are a few funny lines here, but the dizzying stuff has obviously been replaced by the piece ... and instead of conjuring up some fun incidents inside the Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. Doris's co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) are not fit for her, nor the misshapen hairstyle she uses. Still, it's not terrible, it has a few laughs and, for Day buffs, it's a must see. ** in ****
