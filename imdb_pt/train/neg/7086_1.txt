This movie was so amateurish I could hardly believe what I was seeing. It's filmed on VIDEO! NOT movie! I have not seen such things since the early 1970s, when nightclubs showed the movie of the week 'horror movies' shot on video. It sounds like a bad soap opera, and that's a compliment. Some of the actors do their best. Michael Des Barres does well with what he is given to do, which is to act like an out-of-control sex addict. I can not say it's nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits on a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in the camera angles. I can not blame her for the bad lockup of another person, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. His little female voice works against her here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastassja Kinski. She's certainly ageless and exotic, but she's out of his league with it. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is pathetically exhausted. Each line it offers is with three exclamation points. Someone must have told her to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a furious shrew? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette, like the sweet and evil wife, comes out well, and probably the most credible of the group. But that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> This has to be the worst movie I've seen in years.
