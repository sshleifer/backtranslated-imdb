You think the first landing on the moon would be quite dramatic without having to invent things about it. However, this documentary seems to have to throw everything in the scariest way possible. He talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's near-fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and spacecraft had something to do with each other. This causes the computer overload problem (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the final landing sequence to sound like a near catastrophe when it was just a hassle and not a risk to the team. And it takes the "thirty-second" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel remaining before it runs out, when in fact it's thirty seconds before an abortion is mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, go to "From Earth to the Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
