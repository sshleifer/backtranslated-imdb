I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the tickets for the preview for free, but it still was not worth my time, or my friend's. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that the elderly have a past before they get old (no joke). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, one generation no better than the next, to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did their best with a lame story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this comment to counteract the positive reviews given, which unfortunately convinced me to try this movie.
