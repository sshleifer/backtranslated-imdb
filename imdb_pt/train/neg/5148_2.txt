There is a lot wrong with this image, starting with an obvious and redundant script. Courtney Cox plays a comic artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. She is immediately chased by a location that looks completely unbalanced (Craig Sheffer), and who seems to be trying to imitate Mickey Rourke. D.B. Sweeny is a local cop who is supposed to be there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, does the script manipulate the audience about who really is the good guy? Logic flies through the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. If you think "Blue Desert" can be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part is insignificant, just like the whole movie. - MERK
