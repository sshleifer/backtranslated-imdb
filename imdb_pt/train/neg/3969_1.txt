I'm writing this because somehow I felt led to believe that Dark Remains was a good movie. Although not the worst I have ever seen, it certainly is not good. <br /> <br /> Weak script, weak actors and weak direction. Even if they can not afford big names, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress? It was painful to watch an actress throughout the film with her dull performance. The story was a clich√© and badly scripted. The special effects were minimal. The "suspense" tricks repeatedly employed here were hard to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than some of the episodes of Masters of Horrors. But not exactly on par with quality movies yet. Dark Remains is only recommended for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss any movie of the genre, even if it's a bad movie. As for any other person, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
