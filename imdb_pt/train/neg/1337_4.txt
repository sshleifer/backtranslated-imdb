Yes, you guessed it. Another movie where identical twins switch places. I think now that the Olsen twins are getting older, they should try to make the plot less predictable and less like 'Full House' reruns. If you plan to see this movie, do not do it. Watch 'The Parent Trap' instead. It's more fun.
