I must say that this movie is a Mork and Mindy, when I watch I have chills, even got a little wet. When that Korean guy with the spiders on his neck started kicking people, I was like "oh my lord." Asian people smell and suck because they eat dogs all the time. Anyway, Chuck had a rather awful performance and he did not have the intelligence of a normal, non-robotic human being. Some people compared him to his earlier days when he was a carwash analyst and believed in the holy ghost and ghost of last Christmas. This movie is so bad that I put my newborn son in a box and left it in Mr. Norris's box. He can raise my son. I will not leave him in a world where he thinks Norris is a karate expert. I'll let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.
