I had a video of the thing. And I think it was my fourth attempt that I could watch the whole movie without falling asleep. It's slow, and the idea of ​​a platform in the middle of the Atlantic, which may have been revolutionary at the time, is now just a big yawn. In addition to Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is quite forgettable, and it's only in the action at the end that things get really interesting. When the water began to burst, even on one occasion it woke me up. <br /> <br /> But give the man the due. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He does not put it between the index finger and middle as the lower mortals. He holds it in his fingers as he shows us the old pearly browns. There are some scenes in this movie in which the smoke rises to the sky against a dark background and looks very artistically made. But that does not say much about this movie, if all that impresses is the smoke of the tobacco.
