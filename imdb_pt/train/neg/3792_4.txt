I have seen many productions of The Nutcracker. Now, I may have seen this film from the contaminated point of view of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I'm sure that people in the specific field of ballet choreography find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective, I found everything from design to choreography to being dull and bland in a "movie." None of the traditionally "strange" and impressive costumes looked like what they should be (ie the candy did not look sweet, the rats did not look like rats, but rather chocolate kisses), the acting was weak, perhaps too low for the screen , and the choreography simply did nothing for me. This makes the whole show very satisfying (at best), as if it were intended not to differentiate itself from any other production. But remember, again, this is from the artistic perspective of a theatrical director, not a dancer or choreographer, but a straight male theater director.
