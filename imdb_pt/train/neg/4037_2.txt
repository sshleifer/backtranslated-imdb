I have no idea what The Shield producers were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: The Shield is practically unattainable. <br /> <br /> Supposedly the performances at The Shield are great ... <br /> <br /> Actually the show is so badly mounted that you can not even see the performances. For example, editing cuts reaction shots before they have their full impact. <br /> <br /> I do not know what intellectual reason exists for this, but it steals the show from every emotional impact. <br /> <br /> I'll give The Shield a point for ambition on your subject, but that's pretty much all I can give. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a number of talented. artist loses his gift in something so strangely poorly filmed.
