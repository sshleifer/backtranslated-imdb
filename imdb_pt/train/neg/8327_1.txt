IT'S OK. So it's a low budget "movie" (I used the quotes because it was filmed on Hi-8 video). The acting is universally awful, the makeup is ridiculous (blood seems to have come from Sherwin-Williams and I've seen more convincing bruises made from Halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting generally looks like they used the Toyota borrowed pickup for shine headlights on the actors. <br /> <br /> I could forgive those low-budget features if there were any real content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story. But this collection of videos can boast of no plot, no real character and no time. It's a self-indulgent mess. <br /> <br /> And do not worry - there are no spoilers here because there is absolutely nothing to ruin.
