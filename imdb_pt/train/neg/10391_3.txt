I've seen the Gator Bait movies, and that's almost exactly the same as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically demands her vicious vengeance on each of them. What distinguishes this film from those (though not very far) is that sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the movie, but not for a second is sexy. Some of the rape scenes may seem a bit long, but that's only because the film is trying to strengthen the public's need to see this woman in search of revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a weak movie, there is no other way to maintain interest beyond manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her abusers. I spit in your grave is not the kind of movie you expect to deliver a serious morale, but I was happy to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted on the female lead, it was not to pass like a T movie & A. <br /> <br /> B movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and teenage sexuality out of control, and while I Spit on You Grave is unmistakably a B movie and contains more than its share of nudity, Nudity does not guide the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty need for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary dropouts just as they were in the Gator Bait movies, and the biggest challenge for writers seems to have been to discover new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the movie can never be anything more than one B movie is meaningless because it does not convey a message of any kind but simply satisfies the public's desire to see a group of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only problem this leaves is that we have to sit through sexual attacks. Strangely, the first half of the movie is the part that contains the most nudity (though not much), but is by far the most painful to watch. We are even disappointed when we see the woman taking revenge, since some deaths were so elaborate that they obviously were impossible (it seems pure luck that the lake guy has felt such a great desire to embrace). the engine in the boat and presses his genitalia against the propeller, staying as the woman shouts some final words to him and pulls the rope), but again, this movie only satisfies the desire for revenge that the first half filled us. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) You know that's all the movie means, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after, she does not write her book, she does not go out and never goes back to that nightmare place, she just gets on the boat and motivates around the lake while the movie simply stops on her tracks. But what else did you expect? <br /> <br /> Oh, and did you read the slogan? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try to find any man who is being broken or burned. Was I really looking forward to those ??
