Possible spoilers, maybe. I must say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all, the film was made during the height of the kidnapping of Disney. It was created around the same time as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Book of Jungle II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which were disservice to their original movie classics. (Disney also did "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II," but I'll leave that topic aside because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.) Let me go ahead and saying that I'm an avid supporter of the good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney "Cinderella." The sequel to "Cinderella", however, was a waste of time. Cinderella's character in the sequel was very different I grew up watching.In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had moments very out of character with phrases from the time like, "I'm going to make this feast my way!" Let me also tell you that the new Cinderella (as I affectionately named her) says, "Ewww!" This is the anti-Cinderella I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the sisters, is good! to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just members of the horr family RESPONSIBLE for the poor Anasta Asia. My question to the world: Have Disney people watched the original "Cinderella" while making this sequel? Well, it certainly does not look that way. As I recall, Anastasia was as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I'm all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no redeeming point for Anastasia in this movie. At first, Anastasia was evil. In the second, she is good. One can not leave a story like this. I hope Disney notices that this film, among other films, is embarrassing the name of Walt Disney. Maybe now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will begin to form around the House of Mouse.
