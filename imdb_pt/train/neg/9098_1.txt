There is a reason why certain movies go straight to the video and of course the obvious reason is that if it is too disobedient to the theater audience, it is released directly to the video. Of course it would not really be fair to the movies that are good and they are also released directly to the video. This is no exception, although the film has good actors or at least potential actors: Amy Adams (Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves to be better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson, who a melange of teenage melodramas deserves roles. The movie is also skewed: this movie takes place before Cruel Intentions, so this movie is actually a prequel and pretty stupid. This was a waste and it really is a movie that is on the same level as the soft porn and pay-per-view movies. Fortunately for the actors, we hope they can erase this from their resumes. So, if you're looking to see something naughty but do not have the guts to buy porn, then rent this movie as an entry.
