To quote the film, "It's best not to know, better to forget, the best of all is to be abandoned." Oh, the irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror movie but horribly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, and you feel you're being nailed to the start. <br /> <br /> It's as if the writers' cumulative character dialogue could be summed up by bad cop TV and a Jerry Springer show. Adaptable, perhaps, to a movie like The Hitcher, not a Russian horror film. The result is that a potentially optimal setting and some potentially bloody scenes can be wasted and become just silly, not scary or meaningful.
