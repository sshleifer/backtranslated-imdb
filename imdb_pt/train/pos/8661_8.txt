I have enjoyed series of Criminal Intent of Law and Order for a long time. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, the female detective is rather difficult and seems a bit bitter in the series of criminal intentions. See your other side in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the wonderful soft side of this talented actress and if you are a fan of Criminal Intent, this movie is a bash in your acting and you have a good thread of family difficulties in the South. /> <br /> I did not like the role of Albert Finney in this film because he did such a convincing acting job of the old fellow from the South who is hard and intolerant and unacceptable of change. It reminds me of so many men from my youth and the portrait is divine, but you'll probably find it hard to like this movie. <br /> <br /> Katryn Erbe is easy to like in this movie and because I recommend it as 10 stars for fans of Criminal Intent, Law and Order.
