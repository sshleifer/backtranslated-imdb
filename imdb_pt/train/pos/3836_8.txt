Extremely interesting and intriguing film. The similarities with David Lynch (who is quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of Franz Kafka (the owner of the house in this film is called Mrs. Grubach, as is the case in Der Prozess ...) are clearly present, but in this case are accompanied by clear references to Belgium's colonial past in Africa. The exact content of the film I can not describe clearly: this colonialism is an important part, as well as the inability to deal with such past, but the main character's personal memories are also a central issue, and his quest for social issues contact and love. These are the symbolic themes that I deduced from the film, but in fact they are no more than impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic origins, you will still discover an extremely fascinating film full of splendid images (beautiful close-ups of beatles, grubs and other nasty insects are alternated with large sequences of dreams and also the dark atmosphere lends the film's extra style). Maybe you can say that I could not "get" the movie, but I've been mesmerized for an hour and a half, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriousness.
