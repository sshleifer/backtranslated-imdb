OK, I saw this in theaters when I left and I do not know why. I have not seen it since, but I ended up on this page because I found myself thinking about this movie - again I do not know why. But the fact that I remember that speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult - much harder than any drama. Doing it right makes it look easy, but doing it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, mind you, you're falling into this category again for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done the right thing for me to remember this movie with affection. Done in a fast pace, with the tongue on the cheek and knowing that it is not the Philedelphia story, entertain from beginning to end. Brain Donors is another one that fits well in this category (without most of the free jokes). <br /> <br /> A point of discord - the end. It seems the writers / directors had no idea how to end a comedy. The ending tries to be a love story, somewhat weakening the quick and peculiar dialogue up to that point. Then there is the "tassle" scene. Since this has to be seen (male opinion), it is so over and out of place is like a shock. Another rewrite to the end was needed. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail. But if you do not try to dissect it and just let the puns and the fun of it come to you, you'll laugh, I assure you.
