I love this movie and have seen it several times over the years. It improves with each view. I agree with all the positive comments here. Yes, it is blatant and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself making comments while watching. Someone here said Rip Torn was miscast. I could not disagree more. He is brilliant as the dour and miserable Clyde Stewart, who says little and works as a slave / worker. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widow Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a maid / cook (along with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor called Grandma. Also a star is the stark prairie of Montana. It is a beautiful and brutal country to settle in. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effect here, what you see is real! It even has an incredibly perfect soundtrack and a great screenplay. Once you see Heartland, you will never forget. It deserves all the 10 years you get here.
