Leonard Maltin must have seen some other movie. (Although I think his Guide is a valuable resource, please disregard his comments on it.) He says it "starts well and then fails" when it's really the opposite - "it starts tepid and sets on fire." The plot is as simple as it seems. Happy mom, happy dad and happy son take vacations on a secluded beach, dad incapacitated in accident, Mom flees to get help, meets with a condemned escaped dangerous. Mom tries to convince the condemned to help, while Dad waits for life and waits. Humorous, given an electric shock by Ralph Meeker, appearing all of a sudden (the director, John Sturges, films in a clever way that will make you choke) halfway as the sneaky criminal and desperate. Meeker is an unusually irreverent and reckless actor (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly") and he happily snatches the keys to the film's narrative and accelerates from top to bottom. Your character has a habit of smiling childishly and saying, "Pretty cool, huh?" when he is especially pleased with his mistakes. There's a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he secretly instructs his hostage, Barbara Stanwyck, "Do not go away." She shoots back "Where would I go?" (They're in the middle of nowhere) and he notices comedy "Yeah, that's right." The friction between them is a joke. <br /> <br /> There are flaws, a little ridiculous. There is a scene where the police, who have been pursuing Meeker for some time, stop Stanwyck's car and avoid detection. Meeker rests his head on her shoulder as a loving husband would supposedly do, and pretends to be asleep while she is being questioned. A. He seems visibly un-masculine in this pose and B. I think it's safe to say that any adult who seems to be sleeping during a meeting with the force of law would certainly arouse suspicion. <br /> <br /> Thriller that builds for an exciting and uplifting conclusion. <br /> <br />
