This movie was very enjoyable, but you will only like it if: - you hate to go to the dentist, but do not be afraid of a movie where one of them goes there - you love horror movies <br /> I particularly liked of the fact that some care was given to explain the gross actions of the main character. The fact that he is totally obsessed with cleansing (especially in the mouth) and then picks up his wives giving some oral pleasure to the man in the muddy pool is a pretty believable reason to overdo it. <br /> <br />. I give an 8.
