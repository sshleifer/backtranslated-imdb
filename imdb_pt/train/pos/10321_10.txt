Most people miss the concept of Hollywood. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child, within the bounds of the law, I approve of the lessons taught by Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> In all times of conflict or war, public and government seek heroes to decorate. The film industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify themselves - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered for more than a generation as being the "best of the best" before James Bond, Superman or any of the others. All the others who follow Doc Savage are only part of the character, not the "Bronze Man".
