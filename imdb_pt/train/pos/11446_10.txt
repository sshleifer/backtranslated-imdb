Right now I'm watching this movie for the second time (on television) and for the second time I came across it when it was already running for an hour (I think I saw 2 more minutes this time) This movie is really awesome, the way as Goldsworthy looks at nature, changes nature in a way you would never think of, it is truly incredible. This entire film gives you a warm feeling, watching him play with the world around him with so much love. Or just seeing his hands, covered in dirt and broken nails, just touches you.
