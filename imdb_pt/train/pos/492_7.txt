Let me first state that although I've seen all StarTrek episodes at least twice, I do not consider myself a Trekker or Trekkie. They are people who live in the basement of their parents and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears. I gave this film a seven, setting aside the historical errors of fiction. The performance was better than average, but the plot did not bring surprises. They have tried a lot to reverse the engineering of technology, but the special effects were only a great temptation. Now for the historical mistakes, if you call them that, the first Captain to drive the Enterprise was Commander April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to a statement made by both Riker and Kirk, we discovered the Klingons and educated them and gave them the technology (that's why a main directive was created), but as I said, there's no reason to discredit this beautiful series. I hope the frames get deeper, and then the special effects can stay behind.
