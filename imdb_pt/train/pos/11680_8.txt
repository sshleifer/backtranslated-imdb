Okay, Clara Bow's silent film of 1927, it's a spin-off of Rain, with Bow playing the half-Hawaiian daughter of the pineapple king who falls in love with the English engineer Clive Brook. Bow competes with the local widow (Arlette Marchal) for her attentions, but both women have a big surprise when his wife appears (Patricia Dupont). The predatory woman is ready for divorce until she discovers he may be on the verge of a fortune. Bow solves your hash fast. Bow has personality to spare and has some great scenes: his opening nude bath, his hula in a grass skirt and the dog rescue scene with Bow and Brook making their own stunts. Note: IMDb 's credits list is incorrect. The film credits (from the DVD I have) list Patricia Dupont as Mrs. Haldane - not Margaret Truax as listed on IMDb.
