If I was familiar with the theatrical production of Guys and Dolls before watching the movie, I might not like him as much as I did. Although in all fairness, I would probably still like the better film production because of my general worship of both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is quite an actor as well, see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here To Eternity. <br /> <br /> As for some of the other reviewers' statements about the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack, and although Isabel Bingley's voice is better than Jean Simmons's, it's no longer pleasant. the voice of Jean Simmons is much more realistic, although he admits that it is not always a big concern in musicals.Also the only time I noticed particularly the particularly weak vocal record of Marlon Brando was during his performance of "Luck Be A Lady" and only there because I was already familiar with the Sinatra version.I also think the voice of Vivian Blaine is much nicer in the movie than on Broadway. Sinatra's voice would only be able to redeem the faults of all the others if they really needed redemption. (They were not) It's infinitely better than Sam Levene, particularly in my favorite song, 'Sue Me'. <br /> <br /> In addition, the complaint that many songs were omitted from the film for inferior songs, I disagree. 'Bushel and a Peck' is hardly a jewel and the song that replaced it, 'Pet Me Poppa' and its accompanying performance is another material from the Hot Box. I personally do not care about 'Marry the Man Today' and glad I did not was included in the film, I love 'I've never been in love before' and although it has not been sung in the film, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in the Adelaide dressing room. In Love'expresses the same feeling equally well and probably in a range that both stars could capture better. And the movie would not be the same without the song 'Adelaide', not included in Broadway. In fact, if the movie soundtrack was available for sale, I'd recommend buying it instead of Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I have not seen the original production, I can not imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the main movie actors. <br /> <br /> The important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and son gs do not diminish it.
