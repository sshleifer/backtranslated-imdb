Johnny Dangerously falls completely into the hit or miss category with his exaggerated jokes and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense. But that's the point, right? <br /> <br /> The cast is nice; Michael Keaton, a great comic artist, before taking himself too seriously over the years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito, all come forward with enthusiasm and at least laugh at me. But the complete scene thief here is Richard Dimitri (infiltrating the word "Iceholes" in the history of the cinema) as a mafioso who does better in murdering the English language. <br /> <br /> I associate many childhood memories with this movie, I've watched it many times, so maybe I'm prone to appreciate it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a parody of completely innocent gangster film that still conveys some well-intentioned messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> 7 out of 10.
