Besides being an extremely entertaining film, I can add that the costumes and the scenery were wonderful. This loving, fun woman had lots of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were eager to get their hands on their money. This woman had been alone since her husband died. He had proposed to her in a theater that was to be demolished. To avoid this, she bought it. Her daughters were afraid that she was throwing "her" money and decided to take action. The characters in the movie were also a great advantage. I would give almost anything to have a copy of this movie in my video library, but so far, it has never been released. Sad.
