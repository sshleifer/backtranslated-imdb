Red Rock West (1993) Nicolas Cage engages in a deadly crime without even knowing it, and the dominoes lead to increasing danger, adventure and misadventure in the savage American West of the 1990s. Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage pulls the mix with his usual sardonic wit and cautious ease. <br /> <br /> Is the storyline above the top? Yes. Dennis Hopper is perfect as a crazy and almost friendly killer? Yes. Does Cage have a chance? Well, you have to watch and see. This never fails to happen, and caught me by surprise the first time I saw him. In yesterday's second screening, I was amazed at how well it stayed, how well built it was, and how macabre and funny it was at the same time. Director Ron Dahl (who also helped write) is best known for his work on TV, but with Rounders and this film he shows a skilled hand with sensational plots. He is saved by his humor, by the way, and by the caricatures. The bar is despicable, the cops are questionable. And do not miss a special turnout from Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
