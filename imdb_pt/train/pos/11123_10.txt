Greetings from this Portuguese guy :) <br /> <br /> I believe that The Sopranos is one of the best productions of all time, has reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it is difficult to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini fits the paper like a glove! I would love The Sopranos never to end. Is perfect! Must be a subject at school :) I saw Sopranos as a kid but I was too young to stay awake until the end of the episode so now I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I'm watching all the episodes at home before and after and I'm getting addicted, like I did with Prison Break. In my opinion Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best series ever made for television. The plot of both is splendid and the actors are perfect. Congratulations on that work. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my English. Thanks for reading.
