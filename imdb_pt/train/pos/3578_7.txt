12 year old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his big brother, Eugene. Your feelings are held back by the fact that your family can not interact with it (or feel it is not the right thing to do). His only refuge is his grandfather, who is the ONLY one who seems to have compassion on him. Realism will captivate movie lovers of the "true-2-life", but will not satisfy those who desire action and emotion.
