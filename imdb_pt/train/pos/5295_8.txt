I thought this was an absolutely charming movie. The story seems to be a veiled autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong does well in the lead, but the best performances are from his grandmother, Mink Stole (a hilarious turnout) and, of all people, Patty Hearst. I think the reviewers are off base in this. They seem to be taking Pecker's worst appraisal of his work as gospel when I think the film clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist.
