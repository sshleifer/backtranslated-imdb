I wait for every new episode, every repeat with anticipation! The new sci-fi look created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder I hope never ends. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me. Season # 9 should be an emotion in itself. I wish Richard Dean Anderson would show up more often in the new season, since I love his dry intelligence as much as his tantrums in his character as Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes him a winner, season after season. You cancel this program within the next three years and make a serious mistake. Besides, you need a bigger role for Asgard - they're cool.
