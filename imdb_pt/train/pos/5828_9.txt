Micro-phonies is a classic Stooge short. The guys are inept repairers working on a radio station, and during some shows in a broadcast booth, Curly's perfect imitation of a recording of "Voices of Spring" is confused with the real thing, leading to a radio contract and a musical feast. The simulated interpretation of the trio of the quintet of "Lucia de L'Amamore" is especially fun. Without a doubt, this is essential for Stooge fans. <br /> <br /> Although evidence of Curly's ill health is visible in his face and voice, his performance is incredible, and is probably the last glimpse of old Curly. Some fans think that "A Bird in the Hand" is the last great Curly, but his coarse voice and slow motion are very difficult to watch.
