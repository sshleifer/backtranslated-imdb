"The Last Hard Men" is a typical western from the 70's. Most of them seem inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this, but director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford Pupil and this can be obviously shown in many scenes. IMO the start is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the public a trip from civilization to the desert. In the third part, there are some illogical flaws and I complain a little about Charlton Heston. He has to play a former ex-cop named Sam Burgade, but he's in fantastic shape. I've never had the feeling that he really has trouble climbing on a horse or a rock. To me, he did not seem very motivated, as usual, in most of his epic films. The same goes for the beautiful Barbara Hershey who is playing the sheriff's daughter. Maybe they both had problems with the director or were dissatisfied with their roles. Hershey and Coburn are not showing their best, but they are still good. If the screenwriter had John Wayne in mind as Sam Burgade? Also Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is a little underutilized in his role. On the other hand, there is James Coburn as villain Zach Provo. Coburn is a big villain in this. He is portraying the villain between hatred and manic cunning. His role and acting are the best in the film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and shootings are great. The scenes of the shootings are bloody and the violence seems realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had some bloody and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical Western action in the middle of the movie. I would have enjoyed a bank robbery or something similar. Overall it's a fun Western movie. Not a great movie, but above average because of a great Coburn, a very good start and some bloody and violent scenes.
