I'm currently doing film studies at the A.S level and "this is not a love song" is a movie we watched and, in my opinion, it's a film with a very simple plot but a complex story. If you scratch the surface, you'll find a two-man chase movie running after the farmers, after committing a murder: "It sounds pretty exciting." <br /> <br /> However, you need to dig deeper. Discover the true feeling of the true genre. As it is suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, full of confidence, deceit and betrayal. We are not told about this "love" directly through the film, but events that happen on the outside, for example, the way Heaton acts in relation to Spike almost screams this case of love untouched in our faces. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as "junk" just because they are made on a low budget. <br /> <br /> A good movie with an intricate storyline, but it's definitely an acquired taste and possibly not suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
