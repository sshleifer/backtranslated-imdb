Fox's epic account of one of America's greatest pioneering efforts comes to the DVD with some truly remarkable "Extras." BRIGHAM YOUNG (The Frontiersman was added to the European launch), telling the story of the great pioneer leader who, under inspiration, brought the members of the Mormon faith (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in In 1847, after multitudes murdered his prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price) was brought to the screen in 1940, just as America was about to enter World War II. It was a bold move on Fox boss Darryl F. Zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air for the Mormon people, as this was the first attempt to show their faith on the screen. Now Fox, working with James D'Arc, curator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, brought this movie to DVD format in an outstading edition. Mr. D'Arc, who a few years ago did his doctoral dissertation in the film, provided one of the most thorough commentary tracks ever made for a DVD. It separates fact from fiction and allows listeners to understand why these films were highly appreciated by Church leaders, though the embellishments of truth ran through the film. One of the fun parts of the information deals with Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film, he married a woman of a saint and was eventually converted to the LDS faith. There is much to be learned from D'Arc knowledge and it is great to have this as part of the DVD! There are over 100 photos of the Fox & BYU files included on the disc as well as news footage of the incredible premiere at seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thank you FOX for another excellent DVD - and thank you, James D'Arc for your great review!
