This is one of the best Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers movies, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R movies feature great romantic but mellow stories. This still has the elegance of dating, but not as pronounced as the other films. <br /> <br /> This film features not only a good dance, but friendly characters and a lot of good songs. Music is the central theme here and what is good is the addition of a touch solo by Rogers. She was not only a super dancer, but a very beautiful woman and one with a tremendous figure. She also dances with Fred, of course, and they are always a fun couple to watch on the dance floor. Growing up in the 1950s watching "Ozzie & Harriet" on television, it was a real kick the first time I saw this to see a young Harriet Hilliard. No surprise that Ozzie fell in love with this beauty. Although she had that short 30's hairstyle, I recognized her voice immediately. Also in this movie are the quick appearances of Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, but I have to admit I have not left Ball yet. I can not find her, but I know she's here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, except for some obnoxious chewing gum in the first third of the movie, was fun to watch and Randolph Scott - though best in westerns - is also nice. <br /> <br /> This is simply a good movie, good movie, and good if you want to take advantage of the great talents of Astaire and Rogers.
