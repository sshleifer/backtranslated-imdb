The young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic and beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time making it human enough for people to worry about. It is perhaps the best performance of the actors. Notice how he alone holds a multitude of lynchers. Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple woman farmer. Most of the latter part of the film unfolds in a courtroom, and therein lies the only negative thing I can say about this movie. Most of the judge's characters for the viewers are given so many lines of folk humor that distracts from serious judgment which is on hand. But I'm quite accustomed to this, because humor is a trademark of Ford. The supporting pieces of Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
