I'm seeing this on the Star World network abroad, which buys American and Canadian series that last a year or two as The Jane Show. I thought about how many comedies of female comedies I'm really able to watch alone, There's Lucy, Enchanted, I Dream of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind goes a little empty I can not think of any other women are all support roles, not lead. So for me, the Jane Show is in good company. One thing I just thought though. I've seen a lot of things done in Canada, and I never remember anything that was filmed on a regular TV show that shows SNOW! Everything is done in the height of summer, LOL! Granted it is a great place to live climate wise in the summer, but you THINK, they would show a little of Canada in the winter since that is part of the lifestyle there as well. I mean, SCTV, Just for Laughs comes to mind like two long-running comedy shows filmed in Canada and very little or no is photographed with snow present, even though they both do a lot of outdoor photos. I disagree, but I kind of giggle at Jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism with her neighbor, and I like the bald guy and his craziness, I found the same as a British series called The IT Crowd I think) another office comedy with a female lead. It's by no means the best comedy ever, but for a guy to say he can watch by himself, that's something. If I was with my wife, she might really like it, since she addresses sex in the office and things like that, so it can be a good light-hearted comedy for couples to watch. 7 out of 10.
