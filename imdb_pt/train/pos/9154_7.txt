Very good except for the end, which was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script was very good as well as the acting. The visuals were often very grainy, but this added to the film, since the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood for the film. This affection was ruined by the extremely unbelievable end. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this movie an 8 out of 10 but the end hit at a point to 7 because it seemed to radically depart from the first 75 minutes of the movie and it seemed quite forced in the movie. to make filmmakers look smart. <br /> <br /> This movie was far better than films with much larger budgets and seemed to be filmed as a home movie with some extra equipment. Not much in terms of special effects like these, but for suspense it was pretty good.
