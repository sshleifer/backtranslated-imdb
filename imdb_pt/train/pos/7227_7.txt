Peter O'Toole is a delight to watch in roles where the speeches he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to brag in drunken stupor. The lovely Susannah York provides a good contrast to the dramatic presence of O'Toole. <br /> <br /> The film alludes to incest - without a single explicit scene - but is able to entertain the viewer in his strident social commentary. . Although this is not a great movie, it will be remembered for its entertaining presentations. Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a pleasure to watch, exuding tragedy quietly. The possible weakness here is the relaxed direction of Thompson. But the film floats because of the actors and the script. <br /> <br /> I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years - on both occasions, with the name "brotherly love." "Country Dance" is a rather ridiculous and inappropriate title for this film, wherever it has been released as such.
