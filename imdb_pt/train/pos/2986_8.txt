I'm surprised to see even a man who criticizes this old movie. We usually do not get good opera films, and here is a true interpretation of the opera. Understandably, the visuals are not great. It's dated. But as an opera it can not be criticized; and I am an operatic chandelier. I can not even detect a lip-sync; If we did not know that Tebaldi was in the audio, nothing would convince me that it was not Sophia Loren. She does EVERYTHING with talent! Your dark makeup is fine; and she brought the paper to life beautiful! The rest of the cast is wonderful, just like the impressive ballet troupe. Most of the actors are excellent; Loren truly wonderful. His rival Amneris is also fantastic. Who did not care about this work of 1953 is shamefully negligent. Verdi would have liked it! Of course, Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes. I love this old movie!
