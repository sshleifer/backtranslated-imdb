The written word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'Page 3' does is destroy the myth attached to the glamor and charms that color the pages of our newspapers and whose lives (we follow the party habits) follow with such manic fervor that only our intrinsic line voyeuristic can explain. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon on page 3 is as deplorable as enigmatic. How exactly did you get this control over the printed word and when it began to invade the first page is subject to another debate. Bhandarkar cleverly avoids this. He is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And in doing so, it brings together the various elements of this way of life. Like Robert Altman (though I'm not comparing Bhandarkar to Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses a myriad of characters to promote his motive. Whether it's a page 3, the aspiring NRI, the badge holders, the newly rich, a future model, a socialist politician or an erotic novelist; all characters are entered with a goal, and each character has a separate character outline, even if its parts may be lowercase. And that's the appeal of the movie. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 of Nation Today. Initially pleased with her work, she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly which is covered by her falsehood and cosmetic. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to turn that subject into a moral policing film and avoids concentrating on just one character. So the film is not only about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - editor of Madhavi who passively accepts his role of a larger machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a socialite suffocated by social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a homosexual makeup artist and Madhavi's roommates, Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - the daring stewardess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and more) in a story, but all the credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi for writing a precise script. The dialogues of Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, however good it may be, can fail with the lack of genuine performances. Luckily, 'Page 3' overflows with actors and not stars. Konkona goes through its authoring role with effortless ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul receives the best written part, but almost exaggerates. Atul Kulkarni is wasted, although with a subscribed character. At times, the director seems very keen to incorporate as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not make them appear rushed. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Bhandarkar's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism, but he takes it one step further. He takes us into the photographs and exposes us to the horrible realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world. These are the same people who indulged in the New Year's bash, while a few hundred miles away their countrymen had been devastated by the ferocity of nature! Clever writing, cleverly incorporated songs, powerful performances and a genuine sense of sincerity are what make this film worthy despite its lack of finesse and poor production values. 'Page 3' is a great way to get into a new movie year. <br /> <br /> Abhishek Bandekar Rating- **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good *** ** Excellent ** January 29, 2005
