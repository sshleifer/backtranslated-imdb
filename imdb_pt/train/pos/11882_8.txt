This movie was for a while in my collection, but was not it before a friend of mine reminded me about it? until I decided I should watch. I did not know much about Close to Leo ?? just that it should be great coming out of the old movie and it deals with a very serious subject? Assists. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has help? he the? the scenario involves the way Marcel (Leo's younger brother) faces the illness of his relative. At the beginning everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel? Is he supposed to be too young to understand his brother's illness? the fact that Leo is also homosexual contributes to his parents' unwillingness to discuss the matter with young Marcel. I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes, even when someone is young, it does not automatically mean that they will not be able to accept reality and act more appropriately. Except for the fact that the family tried to hide Marcel's truth, did they make a good impression on me? the way they supported their son? even after discovering the truth about their sexuality and their illness. The fact that they allowed young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend was a great gesture from them ?? most families I know will be reluctant to do this. Is it too hot in the scenes where the brothers spend some time together? you can see them being real friends, concern for each other. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama, which I strongly recommend
