A beautiful film, deeply touching the simple but divine aspects of humanity. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and since nothing in this world can be truly perfect, this is very good. The only small thing I subjectively oppose is the rhythm at some points in the middle of the story. The acting is also very good, and all actors easily top actors in high profile films. The current direction seems to have been well thought out, and the script must have been incredible. There are some breathtaking moments and a beautiful continuous circular composition of the story. <br /> <br /> The moment in the movie, when the main character reaches this feeling of being in the sky is the perfect end to a truly brilliant wire.
