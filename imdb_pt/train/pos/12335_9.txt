Warning: contains a spoiler. Tacky plot and in many cases terrible acting. Fontaine is great, but a few others, particularly Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are overly wooden. Ney is lying in bed, dying of arsenic poisoning, with all the hairs in place. However, the film is so juicy and so full of suspense. More faithful to the book than most of the films of his day. Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner (and an adulteress, who was as shocking as - I'm not joking, children) was a masterful stroke. She's just your usual author Joan Fontainey. As the assassins supposed, she dies falling "on the ground, in an empty space."
