Just the kind of movie that I love. Some very good British actors, as well as the first and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) masterfully manipulates a well-educated group of people's lives, throwing in their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book. She interprets the female psychopath very well as she uses her broad sexual appeal to portray convincingly what might be considered one of the last Black Widows. The Tramell is used in dark places within the society and participates freely of sadomasochistic parties in the side of the city that never visits the darkness. From the beginning, there is nothing less than a R ranking here of the dialogue alone. Stone could also be described as a kind of woman Hannibal Lecter, a woman without fatal emotion without the meal plan.
