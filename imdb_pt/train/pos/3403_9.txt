Beautiful production of Techicolor telling the unusual story of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who left her monastery, breaking her vows. The film opens in a convent in Europe, where a former student prays - a lonely black beauty named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She is advised by Mother Superior to go to the desert and "meet", and lose her sadness for the father who died recently. In the train car on her way to the Sahara, she sits opposite a very disturbed man (Charles Boyer) - our ex-monk. She is soon in a hotel near an oasis with palm trees where she again sees our mysterious man disturbed while he is perplexed about what to do when confronted by a very seductive girl. Domini becomes his friend, although he knows nothing of his past - a novel to be followed shortly. <br /> <br /> This film is sentimental, melodramatic and different (somewhat surreal and even a bit exaggerated) - I found it very entertaining and fun. The picture is really interesting - it's full of extreme facial close-ups and beautiful colored photos of caravans of horses crossing the desert, silhouetted silhouetted against a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a well done performance, though restrained, and looks gorgeous. Charles Boyer - is not usually one of my favorites - is really very good at it, I think the kind part suits him and he looks very young and handsome too. Basil Rathbone is right here, except very little to do. Another great orchestrated track by Max Steiner helps keep the drama going - in all, a very nice film.
