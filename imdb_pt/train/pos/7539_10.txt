I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who watched. I was not sure what I was getting. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and made many funny movies; that is, sister's act. <br /> <br /> however, this was not really comedy. it's a drama with comedic moments. So if you are looking for a laugh turmoil, then keep looking. <br /> <br /> This film is about a black family moving from a nice neighborhood in the city to a middle-class neighborhood. I'd say more, but I think it would spoil the movie. This film not only deals with racial relations between whites and blacks, but also about relations with the black community. I think it's worth a try. if you're not really interested in seeing another movie about race relations then this movie is not for you
