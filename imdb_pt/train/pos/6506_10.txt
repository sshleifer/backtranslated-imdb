Totally brilliant. Powerful and evocative. The most compelling series of documentaries ever made on the war. His tone offers a stark contrast to the enthusiastic attitude of World War II that the media displays. Instead of choosing to shout about the horror of war, it allows Sir Laurence Olivier's quiet voice to take second place to the true images of war: corpses everywhere, explosions, terrified citizens and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, mistakes that cost thousands of lives, the suffering of the innocent. Above all, it really brings home that humanity is capable of when all the normal rules of "civility" are removed. There is something distinctly Hobbesian in man in a true state of nature, he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that still shock and fascinate 60 years later. Perhaps there could be a series of follow-up called "The Century at War" for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors. I feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that led to an event that caused the death of 50 million people to produce such an attractive and excellent series.
