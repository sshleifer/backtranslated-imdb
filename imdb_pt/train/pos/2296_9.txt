_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle waiting desperately for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of elderly actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be, but an impressive homage to actors French and its cinema. <br /> <br /> Supported by a solid reflection on film and acting (the fourth wall, hidden cameras, whether to play or not), the story of this film in which most of the famous actors play their own role not mixing with life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur) is quite vague, and accompanies the actors in series of episodes that make the film a lot of fun. While Andr√© Dussolier leaves the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to do his part (great actress, she is hilarious, especially when, in Dussolier's role, she complains about herself), while actors face each other on the street, asking for autographs, like fights and the gossip happens, we recognize the pastiche of other scenes in which each (or another) has touched. <br /> <br /> In fact, for those who do not know the actors (most of them are at least 50 years old) or not knowing the French cinema, this film has less interest, since most of the references will be lost, but still offer a good reflection on aging, acting, public life ...
