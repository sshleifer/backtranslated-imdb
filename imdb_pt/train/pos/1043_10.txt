Since I remember and I'm only 18, my mother and I went and we continue to watch older movies because I consider them a lot more rewarding in the long run (but they do not get me wrong, I love the movies I have today just do not as much as I love 40's and 50's movies) Anyway, now I have to say the moment I started watching the movie my eyes were glued to the TV. Of course my favorite character was the grandmother played by Lucile Watson. But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family were portrayed. The children ... did not act like children at all. But there are good reasons for this, having to hide and run most of your life, seeing the terrible things that children saw in those days that destroyed their innocence. So people saying "oooo, I hated how children acted ... blah, blah, blah," they read between the lines and knew they saw things kids should not see. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... dear Paul did an amazing job !!! Now I know a lot of people are crazy about him going to the Oscars and not Bogie, but hey, both did amazing jobs, so I guess it could have been anyway. But Lukas's performance was so surprising that by the end of the movie I was reduced to tears. I loved this movie a lot and I recommend it to anyone !! :-D
