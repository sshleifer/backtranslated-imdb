Say what you want about schmaltz. One of the beauties of this movie is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about some Americans being called to high purposes and how they have risen to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother of Bette Davis). As Fanny says, "We were thrown out of the magnolias." <br /> <br /> In today's political climate, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used Sept. 11 to show the worst characteristics of humans, we sink to the level of the September 11 assassins to seek blood-thirsty vengeance. Not everything can be attributed to Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies were exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are outraged all over the world. <br /> <br /> Today, we see this film with a new awareness: that the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany was not due to a failure in the German Character, but a failure in humans that allows us to rationalize anything that justifies the practice of immoral and heinous acts. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. But, I'm pointing out how a leader can lead us into a frenzy of terror, hatred and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the blackmailer, who will do everything that needs to be done to his own aggrandizement, no matter how immoral, is more like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand that they can not even be bothered to vote. A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspire to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and we have aspirations for grandiose goals in us. <br /> <br /> Geoff
