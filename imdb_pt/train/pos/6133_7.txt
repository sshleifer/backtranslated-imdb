Easily the biggest low budget horror film ever. I saw this movie for the first time when I was nine years old, and I have to say it scared me a lot. Now that I've grown everything, however, I see this movie for what it really is ... a genius work. Everyone, or at least everyone with good taste, dreamed of seeing a snowman walking around killing people, even if they did not admit it. I always found something genuinely scary about the snowmen, so, of course, for a horror addict like me, this movie was a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is silly, or otherwise devoid of any intelligence ... is a movie about a serial killer snowman, what the hell did you expect? Anyone who has given a low score to this movie is obviously too tense to sit down and give a good laugh with stupid sentences and cheap gore. I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and until the film industry becomes aware and make a horror movie about a killer snowman (which seems impossible, unfortunately) I'll always hold that big piece of indie horror close from my heart .
