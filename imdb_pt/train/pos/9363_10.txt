This movie was incredible, it's the kind of movie you watch and instead of looking at other movies by the actor you look at other movies by the director / writer. Sandler did a good job working with a character out of his comfort zone and the ever-good Cheadle did a great job too. This movie is great for a mature and intelligent audience. The acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the writing and direction of the film. This film focuses on true Americans, the past generation, without stereotypes or racism only people who have united and realized the true meaning of life. This movie is about loss and coping. Instead of choosing psychiatry, she defines it, not as someone who cures you magically but by the need to speak of her feeling to an unbiased person you can trust will not judge you but will guide you through your thoughts . This movie is all incredible!
