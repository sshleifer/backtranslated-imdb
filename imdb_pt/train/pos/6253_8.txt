This movie is great. As I have often heard, it is actually very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people, I am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing, negative or dismantling Austria as a proto-fascist society. Quite the contrary: Although there are some very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters are called very bad people, at the same time you watch love, beauty and humor in the film of Ulrich Seidls. And that is exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE from other films that try to show the lives of ordinary people in an intense and realistic way; his haste, his desires, his dark sides: Seidl clearly never tries to prove, that the lives of the working class people are rubbish! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem very afraid to admit that almost no one's life is as "clean" and "normal" as we would like other people to believe. And that every life has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: the old Viennese, watching his old dance "the eastern way," as he is calling. I think everyone who thinks this ugly scene does not have a sense of beauty and should wonder what it is, this is proto-fascist: the HUNDSTAGE characters or spectators, who are turned off by the body of a woman over 70 , dancing with all her charms for her lover.
