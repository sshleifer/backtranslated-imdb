The information contained in this film is somewhat familiar to many who have been watching the news lately. Walter Reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our wounded heroes when they return. <br /> <br /> What this movie shows is still a truth common to all wars. The psychological trauma that soldiers suffer as they engage in the war and the difficulty they have when they return to civilian life. They are not only changed or affected, they are different people and most do not know how to deal with it, as they do not know each other. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie shows what the military does to our young people. in women in preparing them for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in the war process that leads to all psychological trauma. <br /> <br /> We have over 3000 soldiers killed in the four years of this invasion. ; but we have many tens of thousands who will suffer physical and psychological trauma throughout their lives because of this war. No matter which side you are on, it's up to you to know the cost of the war to decide if we should be in this business. This film illustrates the costs for men and women perfectly.
