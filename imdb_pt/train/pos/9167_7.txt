This is, in my opinion, much better than any of the two versions of the 1990s, but still not so good. It looks old fashioned, probably because it is, but looks good compared to other parts of the BBC era in 1980 such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than any of the 1990s versions, and St. John Rivers is at least covered, though not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but the actress who plays Jane is very old. There is definitely room for a TV adaptation of this size that has more than ten dollars spent on it.
