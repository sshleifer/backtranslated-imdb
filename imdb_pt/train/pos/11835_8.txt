Although I wanted to see this movie from the first time I watched the trailer, I had a deep surprise with this movie. While some of the characters' features and actions seemed a little "caricature," the dark nature of the movie really makes it a very different experience. Instead of the story of happy well-being, this film takes you in another direction that is edifying but also disturbing. Most kids will not understand some of the darkest moments of the movie, which makes this movie a little watchable for adults. I was also impressed with the cinematography, using animation and digital animation to create a perfect network of pans and slopes. The musical score was once again solid, proving that Hans Zimmer is the coolest guy when it comes to animated scores, and I never thought I'd say I really liked Brian Adams' song.
