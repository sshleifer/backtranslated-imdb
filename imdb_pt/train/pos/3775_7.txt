My Take: A goofy but imaginative mess. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter return as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the adventure comedy BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now a cult classic. In this sequence, Bill and Ted have much more to do than time travel. They too can travel through heaven and hell! During the beginning of this sequence, Bill and Ted are getting ready for a "Battle of the Bands" competition, which can make them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, many years in a futuristic civilization, the time mage of the first film (the ever-available George Carlin) is running a university praising the names of Bill and Ted. There, an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from THE HUNT FOR RED October) plans to get rid of the two stupid rock stars once and for all. Then he sends two identical android replicas (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us) to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> After this, Bill and Ted experience death and must find their way through Hell, with inhabitants including the pair's worst memories, and then through Heaven in an attempt to return to earth to save your girlfriends ... and your show. Throughout this journey, they play board games with none other than Death (William Sadler of DIE HARD 2), recalling a similar moment in the classic 1957 film THE SEVENTH SEAL, a help from a pair of intelligent alien beings. and more. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY's array of exuberant effects from special effects does not live up to current standards, and even a little bit of humor and looks and time are a bit dated (to be honest, the film also seems to have been released in the wrong year, even for the 90s). But with little lack of imagination and a lively twist in both performances and direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY are fun, imaginative, and, yes, fake. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
