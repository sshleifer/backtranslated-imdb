I finally sat and watched this movie all the time, and I must say I was very impressed. Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my favorite new actresses - it's not just the fact that she * can * act, but that she chooses the roles more appropriate to her that are more significant and important than what she would first appear. I read some comments expressing their relief at not being a terrible feminist thing as they thought beforehand, but I certainly disagree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks (except for her careful brother Tiny and his trainer and manager, Hector, who proves to be more of a father figure than his real father), who is what the word "feminism" is all about. It's good to see films like this exhibiting the true side of feminism - that they are not a bunch of manhating losers - but that they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is true to herself while still a victim of love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic and complicated relationship, rather than just something that works magically. Girlfight is a true taste of reality and put a little faith back into my perception of people. Thank you, Michelle. <br /> <br /> 8/10 - A very important film that is related not only to young women, but to all who want to go far in their lives.
