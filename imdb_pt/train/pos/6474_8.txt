I got totally involved with this and could not wait for each episode. The acting brought to life as emotional a missing person in the family should be, along with the effects it would have on the nearest ones. The only problem we had as a family was how quickly everything was explained in the end. We could not hear clearly what was said and we have no idea what Gary's part in the whole thing was? Why did Kyle call him and why did he agree? Having invested in a series for five hours, we felt cheated that only five minutes were kept to completion. I asked around and none of my friends who attended were any the wiser as well. Very strange, but maybe we lost something crucial ??
