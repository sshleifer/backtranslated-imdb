Making a book in a movie following the story page by page is never a good idea. When people read the book, they automatically begin to make their own "mental movie" of who the characters are, where they exist, how situations progress. And everyone's view is different, and that's why when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out, you'll always have an angry segment of the audience who's disappointed with the fact that it just does not measure everything a screenwriter and a director can expect to realize whatever their vision of the film, and they expect it to come as close as possible to what the audience expects to see. <br /> <br /> There is no better situation for this situation than films based on Stephen King's novels. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of their stories, the results can be breathtaking and terrifying (CARRIE, SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE), or they may be what fans consider a horrible mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINE: the miniseries for TI and the TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> While it is not even close to being King's perfect adaptation, PET SEMATARY has so many moments of deep malaise that it seems to have bled on the screen directly from the book, that you may well forgive your shortcomings. For this, we have the film director Mary Lambert to thank (she also directed SIESTA, not exactly a horror movie, but another crazy one that you must put on your list), working on a script by the man himself -ster ', and probably one of his best. <br /> <br /> Since most of you know the story, I will not put you to sleep in too many details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) moved his family to the perfect home in the country. Well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of the interstate highway ahead, and the big pet graveyard in the back woods. Since Louis is a vet and has a young child for a child ... well, even if you have not read the book, do the damn math. It's a king's story, after all, there's no mystery to where this is going. <br /> <br /> It's not so much the fate that counts here but the scary for along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to the chilling, cry-inducing life: the horrible memory of Rachel Creed (Denise Crosby), her terminally ill sister; Louis's encounters with the mortally wounded athlete Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), both before and after his death; the trip to the "other" graveyard beyond the animal graveyard. And this third act ... if that does not give you some nightmares, maybe you should check your wrist. <br /> <br /> Good performances from everyone here, especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-meaning neighbor. , Jud Crandall, who gets the best phrase in the story that sums it all up: "Sometimes the dead are better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie version is the release of Louis's son, Gage. Knowing that it would be almost impossible to get the kind of performance a child of that age needed to seal the deal, Lambert and his team still did the best they could, and unfortunately, Hughes was very CUTE at the time to "sell "his intended role as an evil zombie possessed by demons. This takes you out of the movie whenever he appears, although the scenes in which he appears are still masterfully staged (especially the scene of Gwynne's death). <br /> <br /> Other than that, everything else is still as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title of better adaptation to the king, as far as I am concerned; but SEMATARY is well on Top Five. <br /> <br /> Anyway, will anything adapted to the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not likely BLOODY ... for now.
