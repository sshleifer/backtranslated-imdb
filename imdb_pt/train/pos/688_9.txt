I had the pleasure of seeing this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was very impressed. Tess Nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and I would love to see more of her movies. If she could do what she did with the budget of this movie, I'm really looking forward to seeing what she can do with an important photo. Many compliments to the cast for their wonderful performances (that little girl was golden), and to whoever composed the song. The warped "Row Your Boat" surprised me. Very creative movie out there .... I really hope to see this come out on video or DVD because I would buy it in a second. If you have the chance, you should definitely see this movie.
