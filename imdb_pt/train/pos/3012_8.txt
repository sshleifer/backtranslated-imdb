This is one of those movies that you wish you had not seen before - so you can see it again "for the first time." Van Dine's books still bring pleasure - but they are called too flowery by many. This film is by far the best cinematographic adaptation of his works. William Powell is William Powell - say no more. The plot is intricate. The story moves very quickly because you want it to last. Appreciate.
