Eyeliner was used almost 6000 years ago in Egypt. It really is not much that a stretch for it to be around the 12th century. I also missed the series on the flop. There is a second winding season now is not there? It's amazing to me when comments are made by those who are ill-informed or do not watch a show. It's a waste of space on the boards and time on the other. The first show in the series was perhaps a little painful when the cast started to fit in, but that's to be expected from any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can not wait for Season Two to start in the States.
