This is a very beautiful and almost meditative film - there is almost no dialogue, besides narration; and the scenery and music complement each other perfectly. Initially, I did not plug in the red hair of the girl and the fox until she was pointed at me by a friend (who also has red hair!) It is almost an old-fashioned type of children's films, saying that children nowadays prefer animations like Shrek or Toy Story etc, but I feel that the young should be introduced more to the beauty and wonder of nature that this film certainly does. It may not be the best movie ever of its kind, but certainly an excellent and relaxing sight for all ages - not just children.
