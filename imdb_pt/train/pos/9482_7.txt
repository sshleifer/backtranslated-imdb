Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the box office, and often telling dramatic tales and suspense about casino robberies, battles against the mafia and World War II battles, Verneuil could count on two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his time: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It's a strangely static movie, occurring mostly in offices and conference rooms, containing not a scene of persecution and almost no violence. <br /> <br /> Montand gives a good performance if somewhat dry, and he is well supported by the other actors. I could not help but imagine what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story, based on Z (the Lambrakis murder) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
