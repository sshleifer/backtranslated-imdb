This is a pretty decent example of film noir. The setting is the early 1950s, with communists trying to steal US government weapons secrets. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is the unscrupulous pickpocket. It gives a decent performance, but there is nothing about it. Interestingly, he was not only an anti-hero, but for most of the film, an enviable anti-hero. This is not very normal. Jean Peters performed more or less like the prostitute with the heart of gold. That great character actress, Thelma Ritter, shines like the pombeiro. <br /> <br /> The plot had its fair share of twists, cuties and harsh conversations. There is a fight scene near the end of the movie (at the subway station) which was quite brave and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think noir fans (like me) will like this movie. For non-noir viewers, it may seem a bit old-fashioned and the whole Commie thing a little overdone.
