Well done, and along with "New Travels" is a great continuation! Fab to see James Cawley in the last episode "Vigil" Check it out! <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization, and I think we have good substitutes for the TV actors in a play produced by fans. This show manages to capture the feel very well, as they claim on this, it has improved over the years with experience and I hope with a little more experience, a strong script editor and an increase in time and CGI that rendering HF more remarkable than it already is! <br /> <br /> Good work for all concerned! <br /> <br /> (I have a weakness for Lefler & McFarland (GREAT performance), although I'm a little tired of "Lefler's Laws". <br /> <br /> It's already good! Shelby is great (though a little tense) and Commodore Ian is cool (like Fred Flintstone), but does not have the courage of a commanding officer and it seems like Doc, the Counselor, and Rawlins are right about the money in my eyes, as is the wonderful Nechayev (what a beautiful accent - a REAL Russian!) (Well, I'm guessing Rene comes from the Czech Rep.) He gets my vote, and the CGI is good Some of the greenscreen are obvious but on a small budget whaddayagonndo <br /> <br /> Really glad that I fo und it! <br /> <br /> (OK, some of the performances are not great but are made by fans and therefore can be variable - I'm sorry Cmm. Cole) <br /> <br /> The gay material is very thick (Graham Norton would be embarrassed.) Trek does not pay much attention to hetero couples so why signalize Is not it necessary to show someone's sexuality to this point - I hope they tone down and let Aster & Zen be people and not tokens - I do not treat my gay friends differently, they're just common faces. <br /> Musically it is a mixed bag. I can tell you that your entire Trek stocks OST stuff and it works most of the time, but time can fall flat now and then (the end of "Worst Part Fears Part 2" loses the crunch, and the edit.I love the fact that they use the Galaxy Quest song! <br /> <br /> I certainly can not wait for more !!
