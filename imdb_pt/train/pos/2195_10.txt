I loved! Fred MacMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson, a somewhat smug, proud and at the same time very vulnerable saxophonist who is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always there for him. They meet in Panama after Maggie leaves a ship and ends up in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony takes a punch in the nose after she insults Maggie at the thought that she is a loose woman - all because she took off her hat in public. Big fight and Maggie ends up in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her. She asks you to go to NY, where (well watch the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together, where she sings in his arms as he plays the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
