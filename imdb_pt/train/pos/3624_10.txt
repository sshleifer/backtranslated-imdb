The rookie kept me smiling from start to finish. Dennis Quaid played the part to perfection. The little boy who plays his son was fantastic. He made it a father and son movie to remember. The messages are good. Follow your dreams. Failure to chase is good as long as you try. The emotion is palpable. I believe this movie will be a classic.
