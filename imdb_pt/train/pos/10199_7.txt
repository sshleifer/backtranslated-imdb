As a kid, I loved this game. I played a zillion times over the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and it did not matter how many times we played, we never stopped being bored. Then Streets of Rage 2 left. And we quickly forgot that this still existed. <br /> <br /> You play as former cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who have dropped the strength to face the bad guys in their way. There are 8 levels to work in a corrupt and corrupt city led by the evil X. Hitting all the bad guys and the boss at the end of the game is a lot of fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my favorite because you could shoot thugs through the holes in the river. You still have the chance to become Mr. X's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the "bad end" in which you become the boss of the union. Exactly how that is possible is a mystery since you destroy the union on the way to Mr. X, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music. Composer Yuzo Koshiro performed absolute miracles with the limited technology of Sega Genesis. The main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Final Boss are featured songs. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner, I'm proud to have this forever on my console. But with Streets of Rage 2 also available, it makes the first one a bit obsolete. <br /> <br /> Pros: <br /> <br /> Average graphics but nice backgrounds depicted in a comic like progression panel that fits the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great melodies. <br /> <br /> Easy to get into and hard to leave. <br /> <br /> Cons: <Far below the infinitely more complex Streets of Fury 2 <br /> AI of the enemy. Baddies often turn away from you instead of engaging in combat. This is especially infuriating to the boss of Level 5. <br /> <br /> Absence of combined moves. <br /> <br /> Lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Models of bad guys are repeated so far. oftentimes. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Lastar Feature B-
