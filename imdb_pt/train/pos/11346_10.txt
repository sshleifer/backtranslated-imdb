I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the talented Jack Wild and now my daughters also love Jack Wild fans. This movie is exactly what the movies should be: fun and fun. This movie is not limited to children either. Much of the dialogue is directed at adults and Witchiepoo's performance is something you do not want to miss. The music in this movie matched Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautifully. And as a fan of Jack Wild, I would never miss a chance to see him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the difficult life that Jack had now makes this film even more wonderful, especially when he sings the opening song "If I Could". It makes me stop loving adoration for him by giving me wonderful memories of childhood that I am now passing on to my children. Let's all go to Living Island, where there is friendship and fun! And keep alive the memory of Jack Wild, passing Pufnstuff to the others.
