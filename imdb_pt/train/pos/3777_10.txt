One of those rare movies that really enhances its predecessor, Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again. Notable highlights include dueling with death and ending, which is highly "emotional." Keanu wants to forget all that junk from The Matrix and start doing what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan on Bill and Ted: The Return.
