In 1979, I was a 12 year old boy, my parents had just received the box office at home, which was very new to our neighborhood. As a 12 year old boy, this was the first time I saw breasts on television. I will never forget the joy of those times. Vans races, the full drag with the hottest van, the water mattress, the smoke of herbs, the hot girls of the 70s, the 'make love in my Chevy van music, it was all so new to me. A complete movie with all the memories you would expect. I own and enjoy it once a year. When I watch this movie, I feel like taking my skates, with 4 wheels, not in a straight line, going to the park and hunting some babies with feathered hair. truly great memories of adolescence!
