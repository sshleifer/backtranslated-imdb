This movie is ridiculous! That's exactly what I like about this piece of Guilty Pleasure. It's easy to condemn this movie by not including Pat Priest and Patrick Butch, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the math. Pat Priest and Patrick Butch have long outgrown their parts! Time does it with young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who re-rated her role as Lili, was pushing the Big 6-0 (even though she still looked good and was still the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Yvonne De Carlo did not get a bigger share. Still, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles that made them so famous! During the two seasons in which THE MUNSTERS was in prime time, it was Gwynne / Lewis's chemistry that made the series a success. The rest of the cast was supporting the cast members, not to say they were not needed. They were! The TV series would not survive as much as without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie"), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the best choice over Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not up to the original TV series, it still measures very well and is one of the best TV specials "reunuin". who tormented the boob-tube during the late 1970s / early 1980s. <br /> <br />
