Generally, I'm not a big fan of stop-motion movies and at first the RUKA did not catch my eye. However, knowing that this film was made in repressive Czechoslovakia during the era of Soviet domination, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how subversive this little innocent-looking movie was. This subtext really made the film come alive and gives it a real staying power as a work of art and a political statement. <br /> <br /> The little sad movie is done without any dialogue, but it is very clear what is happening. A cute little man is making a pot of clay and having a great time when suddenly an animated hand appears and destroys the pot - turning it into a one-hand sculpture. Well, the wooden man tries again and again to put his hand away and do his own thing. However, over time, the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually holds the man. And in the end, the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand, in a sign of true hypocrisy, gives the man a hero's funeral! <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is an obvious attempt by brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his domineering government. Not surprisingly, although the Czechs worshiped the film and praised it critically, the state (ie, the hand) banished this little parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see her nation liberated a little over two decades later during the so-called "Velvet Revolution".
