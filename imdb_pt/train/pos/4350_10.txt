This movie is one of those that has a resounding familiarity with it. It's terrestrial, grounded and a movie that will make you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk lead you on a journey you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully varied and appropriate; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. This certainly deserves recognition for both the film and the actors! Finally, a work of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special effects that are seen today. I never left a movie with so much warmth and feeling of consideration in my heart; because it looked like someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy wool blanket. Watching this movie is to find a real treasure and revel in it.
