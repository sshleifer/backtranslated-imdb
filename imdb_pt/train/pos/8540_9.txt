It's funny how your life can change in a second ... To watch '' The Waterdance '' for the first time was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get accustomed to a new way of life might seem scary, and note that there are other people going through a similar situation that can help you continue. <br /> <br /> The performances of Eric Stoltz and especially Helen Hunt (oh man !, Helen is the purest and graceful woman on Earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of his last roles serious. A simple and yet profound film that does not leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Really to a movie like that anytime is not answered !! ! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression ...).
