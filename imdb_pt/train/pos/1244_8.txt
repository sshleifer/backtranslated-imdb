I first saw this movie on television a few years ago and, frankly, I loved it. Charles Dance makes one of the most terrible villains that anyone can imagine. Its sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the grossly good hero. I've never been much of a fan of Eddie Murphy, but I think his annoying picture here is a winner: a bit of "Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass". Charlotte Lewis is, to use a banal phrase, but the only applicable, luminously beautiful. Some scenes are beautifully created: the dream sequence, the bird, the silly fight scenes and the climatic confrontation. Through all of this, Murphy is the modern man suddenly fell into an Eastern myth, a stunned and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy romp. Like that film, we have James Hong, the incomparable actor whose scenes, although short, elevate the quality even of Derek. Since 1955, Hong has defined the excellent supporting actor, the "class act" of his profession. "The Golden Child" is silly; it `s not perfect; but it has so many redeeming features that it is a fun and entertaining fantasy that deserves to be observed. After four years, I saw again "The Golden Child"; I liked it even more! It's really a lot of fun.
