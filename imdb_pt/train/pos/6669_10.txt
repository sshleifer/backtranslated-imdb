I saw this movie the day it came out last year. Hilarious, I thought. Well, now it's in the video and I've seen it again. I love this movie! The things they do sometimes are dumb, but that's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are good, but the witty dialogue will make you roll. I'm the kind of person who's going to say that I'm inspired by this movie, so if you like dramas and other things, skip it. But for everyone else, have fun! The acting is superb. Hank Azaria is by far the best (he's neither a commie nor a fruit) followed by Ben Stiller (do not correct me, it makes me sick) and then William H. Macy doing his best (fargoing) I praised everyone from Macy to Garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was very good as Invisible Boy. Two problems: The most boring part of the movie is the subplot of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani and the audience of Casanova. Some scenes absolutely advance the story at all, but it's a blast. Kinka and especially writers tend to creep into a scene until all their hilarity is gone, but they change and you're ready for more. I swear after seeing this, you'll be tired of the explosive climax (which I think was pretty cool) The camera is pretty cool too, moving at a furious pace with the actors. In addition, Tom Waits delivers excellent performance (he has this cool cool hero as he said), and as someone else said, the best parts are when the characters show some humanity to them. The Incredible Captain is rather funny, (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan - I was rolling) and the race is pretty cool like Casanova. A steak: the funniest comedian of all time (eddie izzard) is almost a waste, but his heart is in the right place. So, after all, a wonderful movie. I give you twenty stars and hope someday everyone will see the brilliance in the best parody of the movie, the Six Million Dollar Man. Laughing now as I think about it. 10/20
