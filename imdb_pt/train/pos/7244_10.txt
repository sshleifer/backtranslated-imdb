This is the only feature film about the bridge world. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but after that, the movie is absolutely perfect for describing professional bridge players and how they make a living. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are very funny. I do not think a non-bridge player has the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really gorgeous, sorry that the film is in black and white - I can only imagine how they would be in color. The way the media is portrayed is absolutely hilarious. There is no way the earth bridge is like this. <br /> <br /> Watch as fast as you can and tell your friends about it.
