It is a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their playful children. I felt that instead of a movie ticket, I should have been a member of NAMBLA. <br /> <br /> Based on Thomas Rockwell's respected book, How to Eat Fried Worms begins as a children's story: moving to a new city. The new kid, fifth-year student Billy Forrester has already been popular, but he has to start over. Making friends is never easy, especially when the only prospect is Adam Poindexter. Erica, who's four and a half feet tall, is a giant. <br /> <br /> Other complicating things are Joe, the bully. His freckled face and sleeveless shirts are scary. He antagonizes children with the Death Ring: a Crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill him if you get punched with it. But not immediately. No, the death ring releases a poison that kills you in the eighth grade. <br /> <br /> Joe and his Axis of Evil welcome Billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos. Once discovered, Billy is cool, swearing he eats worms all the time. Then he throws them in Joe's face. Hey! To conquer them, Billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms. Fried, cooked, marinated in spicy sauce, squeezed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. Each meal is dubbed an exotic name as the "Radioactive Slime Delight" in which children finally live their dream of microwave a living organism. <br /> <br /> If you've already met me, you'll know that I have an uncontrollably healthy laugh. I felt like a creeping rash erupting on a whining child that his "dilly dick" hurts. But Fried Worms is wonderfully disgusting. Like a film of the brothers Farrelly, of level G, it is at the same time vomit and delicious. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Bob Dolman is also an experienced storyteller. To increase bets, worms should be consumed until 7 pm. In addition, Billy has an obscure secret: he has an ultra-sensitive stomach. <br /> <br /> Dolman also has a great sense of perspective. With such precision, it is based on children's insecurities and the tendency to exaggerate worldly dilemmas. <br /> <br /> If you were to hyperbolize this movie the way children do their dilemmas, you will see that it is essentially about war. Fighting for freedom and enemies of freedom use pubescent boys as pedestrians in proxy wars, only to learn a valuable lesson of unity. International leaders can learn a thing or two about Fried Worms' global peacekeeping. At the end of the film, I was comforted when two accompanying mothers behind me looked at each other in bewilderment and agreed, "This was a great movie." Great, now I will not need to register with any legal database.
