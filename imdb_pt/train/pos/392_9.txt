The Legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who did not like it were not seeing the underlying mythology behind the movie. They were expecting something similar to Star Wars, and it was not that. Joseph Campbell, I believe, would have liked this film. There were a series of metaphors and hidden meanings that an ordinary spectator could have forgotten. We all have a mountain of spades within us. We all have to enter our own cave of blood at some point in our lives. We all have to face our own insomnia someday. Granted some of the storytelling was a bit confusing, and some of the actions got a bit cheesy sometimes, but I think other points in the movie easily compensated for that. I was watching again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if there is a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (The dubbed version in the US). It may have been stupid for American audiences, which would have actually harmed from this movie.
