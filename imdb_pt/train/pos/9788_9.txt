I was at the same screenwriting conference and I saw the movie. I thought the writer - Sue Smith - very clearly summed up what the movie was about. However, the film did not really need explanation. I thought the themes were clear and inspiring. A film that deals with the ability to dare, to face fear - especially the fear transmitted by the figures of the parents - and to overcome it and, in so doing, embrace the possibilities of life, is a film that must be appreciated and savored . I enjoyed it much more than the much advertised "Somersault". I also think Mandy62 was a bit unkind with Hugo Weaving. As a guy about your vintage, I should look so good! I agree that many Australian films have been poorly lit recently, but "Peaches" delivers the goods. I'm glad I saw it.
