This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters leave directly from their paintings (Death Dealer being the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages to retain the original art sensation. Bakshi is well known for his heavy use of rotoscope (the technique of tracking a live action sequence) and this movie is no exception. However, since the theme of the film is quite realistic (all characters are human), this works very well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is the plot: for once, we have a story with interesting characters. and good action sequences, a really heinous villain and a beautiful baby. This movie has the feel of Conan's best comics, not surprisingly, since Roy Thomas is the writer of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! This is a long way from the live action Conan, not to mention the whole B movie of the genre. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
