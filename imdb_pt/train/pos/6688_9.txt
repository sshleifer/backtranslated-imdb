In the history of movies based on comics, "Mystery Men" is one of the most underrated. This is not a comic book superhero movie! He follows the exploits of a heterogeneous group of well-meaning aspirants, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Launcher (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" mocks various aspects of superhero movies such as "Superman" or "Batman" as expressive statements and questions about secret identities. Most superheroes are not billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but the working class, with jobs and neurotic household lives. So it seems that director Kinka Usher is turning the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found "Mystery Men" to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it does not become a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!
