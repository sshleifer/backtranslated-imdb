One winter day, December 28, 1986, two bored 14-year-olds get a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, sounds interesting," "who is this Jackie Chan?", "I've never heard of him." Two hours later, after watching the movie in a trance, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and seriously out of pocket to collect JC movies!) The movie still grabs me like no other. Okay, maybe I have a soft spot for it because it was my "first" (Cannonball Run does not count !!) JC movie, but it's a great movie. It has all the classic elements of JC, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and Action! Some reviews say it is dated, it was made in 1985, of course it is dated! But then it must be Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! No movies like Police Story, where would the Hollywood action be today? PS set defaults, many scenes were stolen for use in other movies. To really appreciate this, you should see it in widescreen, you miss much of the movie otherwise (yes, it actually falls off the bus in the corner!). If you still do not know him, SEE THIS MOVIE NOW !!!! <br /> <br />
