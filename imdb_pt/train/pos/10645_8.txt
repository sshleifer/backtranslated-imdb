Adolf Hitler's manic desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the theme of this second from a series of seven films produced by the US War Department as an instructional tool for new soldiers who entered the Armed Forces during World War II . Hitler's plan was methodical and well-designed, beginning with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding into the heart of Europe, and then moving on to the "Isle of the World," which consisted of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Its final movement would be to reach the oceans in search of the final conquest of the Americas and the world. In 1935, Hitler ordered the national enlistment, as the rest of the country fell under its evil spell. Elementary school children sang praises and young Germans received training and indoctrination in military camps. Marching unopposed in Austria in 1938, Hitler continued to annex a strip of land on the border with Germany and Czechoslovakia, called the Sudetenland. In 1939, Hitler led the whole of Czechoslovakia. At the end of the year, the world was surprised to learn that Germany signed a non-aggression pact with its deadly enemy, Russia, a maneuver to delay Hitler's military involvement on many fronts. Immediately afterwards, Germany invaded Poland, bringing Hitler's conquest to the Russian gate. He would deal with her later. <br /> <br /> It was during this period that Britain still refused to oppose Hitler's coup throughout Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt that he had won a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, his infamous declaration declaring "Peace in our time." It was not so. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating information to be learned in this edition, at least for me, was provided by a small fragment of images of a German Hitler protest in the middle of the year. 30's. It was led by a German American, having his suggestion directly from the motherland. The place - Madison Square Garden!
