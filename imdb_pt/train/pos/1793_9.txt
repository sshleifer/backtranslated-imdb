I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this movie. I've loved everything from the sentimental moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes in which Mamie Gummer (Lila) is crying because of her bad decision to marry a man to her parents and not because she is truly in love. I loved those moments because they were so real. At first I was seriously scared because I hoped it would not end like Bobby, who was a great cast, but a poorly written film with no real flesh. But during the middle of the movie I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry, but in the end you will want to see the night one more time. Trust me when I say GO SEE!
