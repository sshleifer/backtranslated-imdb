My observations: post-war hilarity. Tom Drake and Grandpa of "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed is charming and beautiful. Margaret Hamilton as always; part smaller than in "Wizard of Oz". Spring Byington is much prettier, also with Hamilton's small prerequisite nose missing. Tent scene at the end with the ex-boy next door was hilarious. As a two-year veteran in Army tents, he looked quite young and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. <br /> <br /> I used to work in a department store, and it was as elegant as this. Unfortunately, it disappeared and disappeared into obscurity. We were famous for those big shop windows that were used to lure passersby into the store to get them to buy all those wonderful wares. <br /> <br /> 10/10
