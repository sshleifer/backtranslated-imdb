This is a better silent movie than average and still worth seeing if you are a fan of the silences. However, if you are not yet a fan of the genre, I suggest you try some other movies before watching this. That's because the plotline just seems pretty old-fashioned and hard to believe in points. But despite that, it's still a good movie and kept my interest. <br /> <br /> A nice girl, unfortunately, connected with the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The film begins five years later, after she realized that he is really a brutal thief. Despite this, she tries to get the best out of it and not dwell on how good life was before this idiot came into her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the girl is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a wealthy lady whose husband is trying to make a trade deal. Unfortunately the lady with whom they were trying to hook up a potential client for a dinner can not do it and the seamstress is generously paid to be the man's girlfriend. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans very well and the man is in love with her! What to do now - given that she is really married and the new guy wants to marry her?! Well, watch the movie yourself to see how everything is resolved. I did not like how they dealt with the husband as it seemed very predictable and clich√©. However, since he was out of the way, I admire how the film also did not give up one end of the numbers and left the film with a few loose ends. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very good movie that is worth seeing, but certainly not great.
