Okay, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everyone says here that this is the worst! But that's not it !!! Did not you see Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! That was the worst of it !!! Now this movie is pretty decent and clings to Freddy's story and it's cool that he had a daughter etc. etc. <br /> <br /> And then I discovered it was in 3-D !!! I was so excited, I remember when I saw in the DVD box that I immediately jumped into the 3-D strings. Much has been in 3-D, although as Lisa Hand Zanes, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean holding a knife, Lisa Zane with a baseball bat, Doc hand, Freddy's head exploding. <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie because it was in 3-D, but I wanted the whole movie to be in 3-D not just in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's 15 minutes NON TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
