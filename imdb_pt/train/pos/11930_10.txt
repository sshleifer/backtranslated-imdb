This movie was really good. I'm not much of a baseball fan, but this is a film that was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. are brought with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. The plot was believable and I love the message. William Dear and the guys set up a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports movies revolve around true stories or events, and they generally do not work well. But this movie hits a 10 on the perfection scale, though there are a few minor mistakes here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
