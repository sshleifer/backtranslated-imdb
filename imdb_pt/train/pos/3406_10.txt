In terms of visual beauty, this movie is great! I did not know that the Technicolor left so early. Although I did not like the ending, the whole movie is fantastic and makes me want to be in North Africa. The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a great advantage and of course she is so seductive and I just loved her in that movie. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I could not get over the scenery and the scenery ... The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, everything is there ... the legionnaires also bring a feeling of "Beau Geste" to the film. They certainly do not make movies like these anymore. Be sure to watch this classic!
