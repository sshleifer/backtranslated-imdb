Clean family movie. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried that I would not be able to see Steve Carrell as anything other than Michael's Office. Boy, was I wrong. He should win an Oscar for his performance. I'll definitely buy this on DVD when I leave. My husband liked it and he is not into movies of this "type". I saw with two other couples in their 30s and we all agreed that it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest. Only 1 curse! Not even because it was PG13. I recommend this movie for anyone who loves comedy, drama, romance and more!
