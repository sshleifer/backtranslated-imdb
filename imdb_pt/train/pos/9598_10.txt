I traced the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the movie !! What a trip! And what a journey to finally meet Darius Weems! Such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a crew! To hear Darius laughing at being on the water in Panama City to see his anxiety of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he paced in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, bet him to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This movie needs to be seen by everyone - young and old. Dario and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. They gave Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took Darius in the journey of his life; and they have touched many and many lives. By raising awareness about DMD and encouraging funding for research, this film will help achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
