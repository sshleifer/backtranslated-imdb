Well, what can I say after watching this fantastic movie when my nerves are still squirming! Jacques Audiard, the director, must be making a good name in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel is no Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is not Penelope Cruz either, but these two are fantastic actors, and this is a tense and convincing thriller that starts slowly with some clever character building and then starts putting tension on the one wonderful climax. Others wrote about the plot, so I will not say more than everyone in this movie plays its role perfectly, the director, the actors, even the cameraman, and everything seems so real, there is no stupid shooting game, the fight when it happens is so credible, the expressions, the emotions, it is almost like you are there as a spectator. Do yourself a favor, grab the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn on the lights, take the phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this hitchcockian thriller :)
