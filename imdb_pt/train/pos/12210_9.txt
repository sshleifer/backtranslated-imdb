People say he's funny, but they had to reduce it substantially in post-production. I have harry as a teacher now at UCSD, and it's honestly one of the best lessons I've had, it's pretty funny to here about what happened in making the movie cause harry is so excited. I originally watched "joy of life" for another class where Harry made a voice in the film, and I started watching that movie after I started the class. Harry originally did some performance work, and is really sincere about creating moments that move you, especially when you have to re-edit things until you get it right then, but it's something you see in this movie.
