'Mother, give us a look at how the CIA operates in third world countries. The character of Winters, supposedly a salesman, is actually a CIA agent. The film, however, flirts, but does not step on very serious ground, and is more of a challenge, and funny. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss does a fabulous job as Jonathan. actor and Alphonse the dictator, creating two separate characters and preaching both. The beautiful Sonia Braga is great as Madonna, and Raul Julia plays with a funny performance like Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. It's one of those performances where you never know what the character is thinking - it can be enjoyable or become psychotic at any time. Charo is in her hand as a maid and can be funny and discreet at the same time. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, not a great blockbuster, but a lot of fun.
