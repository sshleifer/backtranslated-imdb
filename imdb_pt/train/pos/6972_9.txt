The episode of Caprica (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Actually, this episode is exactly the same content as the DVD release. That said, episode 01 gives a very substantive basis of the very popular series "Battlestar Galactica" (both the original and the remake of 2007). Applies significantly more to the 2007 series. Like the last-minute science fiction plot, this series explores the "virtual" life or environment. In addition, we are given much knowledge about the lineage of the Adama family, as well as their relationship with the undeveloped series (in the Battlestar Galactica series) of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular theme of "virtual" life and (as expected) the early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> Most of all, I really enjoyed this episode. Although not new material for me or for anyone who has watched the DVD release of pilot Caprica, the series looks very promising. As is the case with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a hook to ensure that the public accompanies him (sci-fi community). I will definitely continue to observe determination and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
