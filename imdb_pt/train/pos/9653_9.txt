First love is a desperately difficult subject to be convincingly accomplished in the cinema: the encompassing passion involved usually ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, a bit ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Lifshitz manages to avoid all pitfalls and offers an exciting, sexy and captivating tale of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangentially touches on some of the deeper themes of human existence. <br /> <br /> The central story is Mathieu, 18, a loner, introverted boy who meets Cédric, more extroverted, but equally lonely, while on vacation with his family. As summer heats up, they fall in love and, when their holidays are over, they decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in catastrophe: Cédric cheats with Mathieu who, disturbed, tries to take his own life. He survives, and in order to get a perspective back on his life, he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time covered by the cold of winter. <br /> <br /> If the tale was told like this, it would never have the impact: much of it is implied, everything happens in a non sequential way. <br /> <br /> Intricate narrative is essential to gain a deeper sense of the passions experienced through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three timelines used (love summer, post-suicide psychiatric hospital, and winter rebuild) are color coded: warm yellows and oranges for summer, a blue almost frighteningly cold for hospital scenes and brown hair. and blues for the winter by the sea. <br /> <br /> Both leading actors have done excellent performances, although it is a delight to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) accustomed to his full capacity (I am more accustomed to seeing him extended in Gael Morel's flabby dramas), Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) has to be highlighted for a special mention: you can feel her loneliness, then her almost unbelieving passion, then her character collapsing behind a wall of aphasia. Beautifully created gestures go far beyond what dialogue could ever have. <br /> <br /> The topics covered are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty in actually understanding what the other is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning? The title of the movie "Presque rien" (Almost Nothing) points to all this and, in fact, to one of the main scenes of the film: in trying to understand why Mathieu tried to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he had cheated. in him?? "Non ?? enfin, oui ?? une fois, mais ce n'était rien" (Not well, yeah once, but it was nothing). Does Cédric still love Mathieu? he took him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (neither of which we see) and tries desperately to contact him again after he leaves? but he can not understand that he has lost him forever, because something that seemed to him nothing (a matter of no sense) is all for Mathieu. <br /> <br /> Although the film is darker than the unfortunate poster of Pierre et Gilles suggests, it is not without hope: we can see Cédric's slow and painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat he adopts, then through work at a local bar and finally contact Pierre, who may be his next love. . But here the story ends: a teenage passion, throughout the year, another perhaps beginning. So, what was that? Almost anything? Certainly not when you are living it?
