In the late 1980s, Warren Beatty created and starred in the literary Reds epics about the founding of the Soviet Union, seen through the eyes of radical iconoclasts John Reed. It was a deep, entertaining film with a message presented by a cast of stars. At the end of the decade, Warren Beatty created another type of epic in Dick Tracy, which is not meant to be anything but entertainment, with a lot of better actors around, just having a great old time amidst tons of makeup. That both Reds and Dick Tracy could come from the same guy speaks volumes about the range that this man has as a player. In this film, Beatty was able to catch all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them on an original screenplay. <br /> <br /> The city's biggest maverick, Big Boy Caprice, is making a move to actually eliminate the competition. The film begins with him rubbing Lips Manlis' henchmen in a Valentine Massacre style rehearsal and then Lips himself being tailored for a cement overcoat. But Caprice's moves are making him a target for Tracy. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a third faceless, mysterious individual is trying to overthrow Caprice himself. Will our hero solve this tangle of crimes? <br /> <br /> The spirit of fun that this movie has is truly contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong blunders to look like the cartoon creations of striptease author Chester Gould and then sculpt the biggest slice of ham, you have to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Pacino was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but any of these guys could have it, it's just that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets more time on the screen. Only Beatty plays quite straight, all others seem to play out of it. Dick Tracy won the Oscar for Best Art & Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna, Sooner or Later. The fact that he was able to make someone like Sondheim write a score for this movie only shows that Sondheim wanted to play the game. As for Madonna, the Material Girl does more than cling to all these heavyweights of acting as the singer of the Breathless Mahoney torch. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, Dick Tracy's films were delivered to B movies and worse as Saturday. afternoon series. The only thing that rivals this extravaganza of all the stars is a radio broadcast made for the Armed Forces Radio during World War II, which came to the vinyl. Do you believe in a cast as Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and the Andrews Sisters? Try to find a recording of this gem. <br /> <br /> Until then, Warren Beatty's classic comic strip for the big screen will work very well.
