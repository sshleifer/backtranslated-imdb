This is a better adaptation of the book than that of Paltrow (although I also liked that). It's not so much that Beckinsale is better - both are very good - but the script is better. Davies is master at adapting Austen for filming, and the production figures here are pretty good. It's not as bright as the Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the locations and costumes really worked better.
