Saved when left, this movie now looks beautiful and looks great. Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a moving central performance of the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not jump and show himself - his long, slow images encourage you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity. The play looks like a TV movie, and it's certainly studio bound, but none the worse for it. Many contemporary films on "historical" themes can not resist dumbing down. What would Mel Gibson have done to the maid? Many drooling her pictures in the rack probably then crisping on the barbecue as the flames get hold. Preminger does nothing of the sort. Burning is mostly shown through a guilty reaction. There are some weak performances, but not enough to cause serious damage. I got this movie on TV and was not expecting to watch, but I was stuck. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has an unexpected resonance.
