I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier is a great series of fan fiction movies and I can not wait to see more. I just started watching this series of movies last week and I can not get enough of it. I've also recommended other people to watch as it is worth the view. I've watched each episode many times and I'm hoping to see more episodes come out. I rated a ten, but I think it deserves a 12 loll My compliments to the staff of Star Trek Hidden Frontiers in a great job. If you like Star Trek I recommend checking out this fiction movie from star trek fan. The detail associated with this series of films is excellent, especially the ships and planets used in it
