Luchino Visconti was light-years ahead of his contemporaries. The great directors of Italy in the forties and fifties were men who understood the medium, but it was Luchino Visconti, a man of vision, who dared to bring a film to show what he was capable of doing. He clearly shows his genius early in his distinguished career with "Ossessione," a movie based on James Cain's "The Postman Always Ring Twice", which was later made by Hollywood, but that version pales in comparison to what Visconti has achieved in the movie . Luchino Visconti and his collaborators onscreen included an uncredited Alberto Moravia, a man who knew about the effect of passion on humans. <br /> <br /> The movie was well preserved in the DVD format we saw recently. The film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how Visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that sounds true in a plausible way, something that the American version did not have. <br /> <br /> The film is the intensity that the director received from his main players. The magnificent Clara Calamai does an incredible job as Giovanna, the woman who married an older man, but when Gino appears in her life, all she wants to do is get rid of the gentle man who gave her a chance in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations of the achievements of Calamai in the Italian cinema. The last sequence of the film shows Calamai at its best in the irony that serves as moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed. <br /> <br /> Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti, one of the best actors. of his generation who appears as Gino, the handsome man who awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna. Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna, something that Mr. Girotti designs with so much ease and sophistication that is not equal before on the screen. Girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy, but with another actor may not have been so apparent. Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe, the older man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact, his character sounds truer than his colleague in the American movie, where he is seen more as a clown. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way the Italian directors of the era were favored. The original soundtrack of Giuseppe Rosati is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes arias of Bizet and Verdi that fit well in the context of the film. <br /> <br /> "Ossessione" is a film to cherish because we see a great Luchino Visconti at the top of his form.
