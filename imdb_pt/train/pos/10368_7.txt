Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie. She has an incredible accent, and she shows incredible skill in this movie in general. I really felt for her when Lindy was being chased. It was played realistically too. She was annoyed, annoyed, and unpleasant, while the media and the government continued their relentless witch-hunt. I did not expect much from the movie initially, but I really became interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and on real events. It turned out to be better than I had anticipated. Sam Neill was also excellent; This is the best work I've seen of him, and I really liked him in other movies (The Piano, for example). I gave the movie to 7, but if I could just evaluate the acting, I would give a 9.5, and a perfect 10 for Streep.
