This is a movie for entertainment; I do not think the world has made social commentary on a small movie. I personally find this movie funny, audacious and memorable. It's a fantasy not unlike a gray girl becoming a princess. This film was done very well, I must add, in the 70's, a time of the best experiments in the cinema, with the possibility of mentioning the sexuality of a person. This movie is not about a person being homosexual or not, it is nevertheless about love in all the strange ways. This movie shows some of the realities of being gay in the 1970s in Hollywood, or California. Cute boys being looked after by older, not so handsome men. Women who had to be deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career. The bathrooms were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then the fantasy begins !! Let's mix a lesbian with a gay and add some alcohol and what do we have? Well, this movie, which somehow was better than this sad remake "The Next Big Thing". Maybe someone should have asked the whole team to see this movie and then try to do better. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie when I saw it in the 70's and still brings a smile to my lips now. I cordially advise anyone who wants a funny, sexy movie - to curl up with some popcorn and have fun. Some people need to light up !!! And this is the movie you should do with it! <br /> <br />
