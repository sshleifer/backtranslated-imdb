I think the plot idea is perfect for first exploring the emotional experiences of the people involved and second, as someone wrote in a commentary, the implications of this type of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in Romanian society. <br /> <br /> So ... to start with the second aspect ... to make it short, it was not visible at all ... <br /> <br /> as for the first .. Like I said, he had a lot more potential ... I think this kind of relationship carries a lot more tension ... a lot more tension ... and the potential tension has not passed ... <br /> I think the trail sound could have been more than those few songs in the background and theme (which was cool but not enough and not always in the right moments) ... yes ... I could feel the absence of a better soundtrack. . <br /> <br /> The actors ... I think they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... not enough sensuality at key moments ... <br /> <br /> total of 7/10 .... mostly for the story
