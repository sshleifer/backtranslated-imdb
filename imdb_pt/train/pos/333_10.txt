In all honesty, this series is as classic as television as the original poem is for world literature. Far from being exploratoryly crass, it is a beautiful and respectful interpretation of one of the texts that define Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was moved by the situation of Ulysses and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (which was felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (It should be mentioned that the gods that appear here are not ridiculous CGI creatures fluttering in the wings of the ankle, or models poorly dressed in bikinis.As in Homer's work, they act through mortal agents or are rarely represented by classical statues .It's a pity that it's not available on DVD, especially given the much lower and odious Odyssey adaptations one can find in video stores.
