This is one of the more superficial episodes in which the plot really seemed an excuse to have fun. BUT, I enjoyed this lightweight approach and this really is one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level. Think about it - team members have encounters with the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a samurai warrior, a horse rider who kills McCoy, and a series of other seemingly bizarre events that simply do not make sense at all until the end. Despite all the danger, you can not take everything too seriously - it's too much fun and the whole episode seems very surreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's great.
