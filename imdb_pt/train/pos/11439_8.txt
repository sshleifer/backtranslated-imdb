OK - even the 2 versions of this movie. There were 2 people involved in the creation - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he really did not have any kind of statement in the film - just helped with money) - the 'Adult' version was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or approve this version (as it was done in the back). Thanks to Ladd's films, they did not advertise this movie and threw all their advertising money into "The Right Stuff", hoping that would get them through ... and that did not happen. So, this movie never had a chance. When "Twice" came out (HBO) - they showed the rolls with the Bill version and John threatened to sue if it was shown more (did you notice how the 'adult' version was not on for long?). Showtime has the 'clean' version. The version on videotape and on the CD is the version approved by John (who holds more power than Bill). It's a shame, actually, as the "adult" version is actually better and makes more sense. But it is VERY doubtful that it will be released on this DVD version (or any other format other than bootleg). Sorry to disappoint you all. I know all of this information as I used to be the president of the Twice Fans Club (there are still several items in the movie - I used to have a version of the "adult" version of the mailbox but it was stolen - it only has a partial copy her HBO now). 8 stars for the 'adult' version - 5 for the 'clean' version. Any other question just ask.
