William Powell is a doctor who deals with a murder and an ex-wife in "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford", starring Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. It looks like Powell had chemistry with just about any woman he joined. Although he and Myrna Loy were the perfect couple on screen, the actor made some other "Thin Man" movies, one with Ginger Rogers and one with Arthur, both with very good effect. <br /> <br /> No one gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty pro and "Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. The ex-mrs. B has Mr. B served with a subpoena for alimony and then comes back to help him solve a mystery that she dragged him inside. And this is not the first time she does it! It looks almost as if there was a "Bradford" movie before this one or the one that was meant to be the first in a series of films - B complains that his former mystery writer is constantly leading him to cases. This time a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies just before the finish line. <br /> <br /> The solution of the case is a bit strange, but it is out of the question. The point is the play between the couple and the interference of the ex-Mrs. B. Jean Arthur is very glamorous in his role and very funny. However, with an actress who looks as smart as Arthur, the mood seems more intentional than energetic. I suspect the writer had something else in mind - let's say, the crazy side of Carole Lombard. When Arthur hears the police arrive, she says, "Oh, it's probably about my pension. I've been waiting for the police to take part," is more of a rib for Powell than a serious statement. Still works well, and shows how a good actress can be part of it. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching, as William Powell and Jean Arthur have always been.
