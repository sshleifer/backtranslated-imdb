Fun Jim Belushi vehicle, a modern cockeyed version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel that lets Belush see what life would have been like if he had "made it." Jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast; It looks like real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar nominee, but good fun.
