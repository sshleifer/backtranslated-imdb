Example of how a WWII documentary should be done, using first-hand accounts of actual troops and civilians who participated in this terrible conflict, and archived images collected over time. I realized this in a replay on the History channel about a year and a half ago, with no real knowledge of World War II at the time, but that involved me, and now I consider myself a World War II aficionado, watching and reading anything that I can find about it, but nothing comes close to this landmark documentary, it's definitely worth buying the set of boxes ............. <br /> <br /> This is simply documentary making it of the highest standard.
