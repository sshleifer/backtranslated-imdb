This movie is one of my favorites. It is difficult to explain why. It may be Corin Nemec's innocence and embarrassment paired with Cheryl Pollak's daring, but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack. In addition, some of the characters have small lines or movements or moments that are fun in themselves. Finally, the story is one that always pulls the strings of my heart, and the last scene is so bittersweet. All in all, I love this movie; is perfect for a night of sentimental and sticky girls.
