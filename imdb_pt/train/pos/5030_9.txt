Something surprised me about this movie - it was really original. It was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on video because I did not even know about it before I watched it at my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you will not regret it. Suspense develops and finalization is excellent. <br /> <br />
