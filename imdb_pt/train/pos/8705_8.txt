Despite the title, The Sword Bearer, and the DVD cover (action / heriocs poses of The Sword Bearer) this is not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) Here's the story of Sasha, The Sword Bearer, who is cursed for having a retractable forearm sword. Cool you say, but no, this is real life. If you had that power when you were a child, you could control it when, say, you were up against a madman or when your mother's boyfriend was beating her. And if you do not control it, how do you deal with being a killer for two to 12 years? <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's where Sasha is when we find him. Wandering aimlessly after another murder (much like A Bout de Souffl√©). He then meets Katya, and they fall in love instantly, giving Sasha a real reason to live and try to change his ways. However, his past is still haunting him in the form of two policemen. <br /> <br /> This is essentially history, and there is virtually no action on the screen, though much is suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood superhero movies, we have very little history, there is no thug (unless you count The Sword Bearer himself), but there is a lot of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking if you can find it.
