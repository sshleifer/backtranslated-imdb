I heard that Madonna was briefly considered for the role of Catherine Tremell. Compared to Sharon Stone, Madonna is very coarse and BAUERISCH. She's not even close to that. <br /> <br /> EVIL INCARNATE: Sharon Stone is a bit long in the tooth, despite the beneficial effects of modern chemistry and surgery. Yet she ingeniously treats us with a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. In the scene of obligatory sex, she projects pure and crystalline lust. Especially his bright, hooded eyes and a face full of pleasure. Thanks to the brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques, the severe lines of age are manifest only occasionally. On the contrary, it appears to have a slight golden glow (YES, YEATS). <br /> <br /> The locals gave us a view of London which is a welcome departure from the usual London places. Catherine's character is so powerful and menacing that I thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed. I would not have had a chance. <br /> <br /> THE ORIGINAL BASIC INSTINCT; Attempts at Censorship: I must briefly comment on the original 1992 film, set in San Francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. It's great from the music to the locals to the sets and so on. Paul Verhoven made impressive cast and crew performances. <br /> <br /> That the main Baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of the gay and lesbian activist groups of the Bay Area. Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. SWELL UP. These philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, urging rewriters to advance their political and psychiatric agendas. Example: Sanctimically claiming sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be changed from BAD GIRL to BAD GUY. In places in San Francisco, gentle and tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. Executive Producers Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna pledged to fight any effort to restrict guaranteed artistic freedom in our democracy and obtained precautionary measures against disruptive tactics. <br /> <br /> Blowback: Thanks to the hit activists, the film received wide coverage from the national press - millions of dollars in free advertising. His calls for viewers to boycott the movie resulted in a reaction that made customers wait in long queues wherever the movie was released. He also received widespread critical acclaim. It was, in the words of the reptilian Hackett of the NET, "A BIG BITTTED!" Sorry, Gentle Reader; I just could not resist it. Yes, it's a comic book. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe that both BASIC INSTINCT 1 AND 2, with their brilliant scores, aesthetics and acting, are works of art that deserve protection under our Constitution.
