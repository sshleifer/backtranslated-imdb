The second episode of the first season is a delightful tale of love, betrayal ... and a lunatic fugitive dressed as Santa. <br /> <br /> A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) has just murdered her husband on Christmas Eve for his life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a psychopath in a crazed Santa suit (Larry Drake, perfectly exaggerated) threatens his life ... as well as his precious young daughters. <br /> <br /> This episode is warmly remembered even by those familiar with the program. By the way, this private reviewer watches every Christmas routinely. Most notable for its escalating suspense and twisting narratives, and everything through Houst is among the best tales of the crypt.
