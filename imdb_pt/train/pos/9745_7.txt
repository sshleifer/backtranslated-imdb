As someone commented, this is a well-being movie. It has glorious landscapes and the wonderful voice of Luciano! I've seen this movie many times and only saw it again this afternoon. I had forgotten how much I miss the singing of Pavarotti by Nessun Dorma and I need to get off the CD! It's a great movie to spend the afternoon immersed in fun and daydreaming. Eddie Albert is great as the agent and a little overdone, but all the agents are anyway. The Italian countryside is beautiful, but nothing speeds the balloon ride for the perfect view. If you need acting out of proportion to Olivier, this movie is not for you. If you just want a fantasy flight and wonderful music, watch this movie. Just enjoy!
