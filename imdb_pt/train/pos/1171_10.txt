I found this episode one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. The creators of South Park made the best parody of a Romero movie I've ever seen. They actually touched on Romero's underlying social commentary that he made with each of his films. I'd love to know what George Romero's opinion of this episode was. I'm sure it was purely positive! Keeping your true vision of your epic zombies totally intact! Most spoofs deal with pure blood without making the viewer think how Romero tries to do with his films. I think if an outbreak of zombies happen, we can really worry about our property values ​​before our lives as shown in this episode!
