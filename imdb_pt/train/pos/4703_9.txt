This movie is totally hilarious. His cast immediately clicks on frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through gangster movies. The brother's conflict with his brother appears when Johnny's brother becomes a better donor D.A. However, the best character is Johnny's rival, the exaggerated Moroni. As Johnny says, "This man should be arrested for massacring the English language." <br /> <br /> Check it out on video. It is worth taking a look.
