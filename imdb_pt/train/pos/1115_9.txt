This is one of those unfortunate movies that suffered an even sadder and unhappy death at the box office. I saw this movie at a local art cinema, in revival form, shortly after it invaded the main theaters. It certainly deserves to be addressed a second time (or even a third). Sandra B. takes it to the limit by making spoken words and picking up some well-known songs in this play (Hank William's version of 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' can easily tear him to tears). Maybe someday the audience will be ready to take this film a little more seriously (but not without some well-placed laughs as well). The movie moves at a fast pace (thanks to some good editing), so some viewers will not find this obsolete and boring. Maybe a rebirth is just in the plumbing.
