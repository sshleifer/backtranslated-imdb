This film deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among current aging. As someone who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of Alzheimer's disease or who are in training stages, I suggest that every doctor recommend this film to any family facing the trauma of this disease. The film is designed primarily to talk to the patient's family and reaches the heart of the fight. Casting is excellent and the dramatic portrait is excellent with a very dominant plot.
