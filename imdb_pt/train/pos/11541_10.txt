Matthau and Lemmon are at their best in this - everyone else in the movie is also great. The Dialogue is excellent and very, very witty - and the scene in which the character of Lemmon tries to clean his breasts in a restaurant makes me roll on the floor with laughter every time I see him. Anyone who has seen the not-so-great sequel should not be removed from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I love it. And the fact that Jack Lemmon interprets his character so directly, with tragic implications, only increases hilarity in my opinion. These two big guys have done a lot of movies together, but that's the best - no doubt.
