My expectations were pretty high for this movie. Everyone I know and who watched this film in the movies told me that everyone got the credits because they got very touched. My expectations could not have been higher, anything less than wonderful would have disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie. I loved how I dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps that a Hollywood movie tends to include. In this film the characters worked with problems they had for decades, they worked with prejudice, they learned to open up. But it did not come easily, and not just singing a song or two. It was painful, took arguments, led confrontations. It looked like real life. <br /> <br /> One scene that really stood out to me was the scene in which Gabriella sings her song. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is beautiful, and you could tell that she was not just touching her lips with a previous recording during filming (which I often encounter in other films), she really sang with her whole body and soul. You could feel what Gabriella was feeling in that scene. If this movie had been made in Hollywood, her music would probably have been sung to the end, and would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his habits, as well as make other people in the village realize something. or two. Instead, it came in half and brought no solution. Her husband did not get overwhelmed and realized what he was doing, and did not seem to let anyone else in the village more open. It was beautiful, it was pure and it played, but it did not magically solve all its problems. That seemed real to me, is probably what would have happened in real life. The whole movie seemed real life to me, nothing tidy, but all with a sense of joy and happiness. You rarely find a movie that looks so realistic. <br /> <br /> There were some things that bothered me, but hey, no movie is perfect. If you have not already done so, you should go see "How is in heaven" and be filled with joy for life, a sense of hope and the feeling that you were touched at a level of films rarely reach. You will be sad, sad, happy and with a dozen other emotions. <br /> <br /> Someone once said that if all the people in the world sang in a choir there would be no more wars. Having seen this movie, you may have to agree.
