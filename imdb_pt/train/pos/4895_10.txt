It is rare that I sit in front of the TV specifically to watch a particular show. It's even rarer when I really like the show in the end, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A remarkable cast, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm and an excellent, witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience. I really can not express how good I thought it was, so I will not try, I'll just say, if you have the opportunity, PLEASE SEE !! I just hope it comes out on video.
