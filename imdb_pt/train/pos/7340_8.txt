This animation has a very simple and direct plot between good and evil and has everything to do with action. What sets it apart from other animations is how well human movements are animated. It was really lovely to see the woman running away running across the screen from left to right and looking around, her movements were done so well. Why do not they use this rotoscoping technique nowadays? It is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, in its prehistoric setting and poorly dressed women, was clearly dedicated to showing the beautiful maiden in danger in many sensual ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. Some may hate this and consider it as more of a male sexual fantasy, others (including many women) will love its aesthetic quality. I sure do not care! Bakshi loves to animate lush and voluptuous girls, as can also be seen in Cool World, and I do not think he has to apoligalize since it is practically adult entertainment. But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I have never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> This was simply special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime cuisine, and for that reason alone it was worth watching since it is possibly Bakshi's best. For those who enjoy animations with lush women: try the Space Adventure Cobra as well. <br /> <br /> Dou Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
