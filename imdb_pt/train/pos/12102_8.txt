This starts a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist ... Poe bets the man can not spend a whole night in a scary castle. Well, of course he can, but will he come out unscathed? Hard to say with all these strange people who should not be wandering around, including the icy Barbara Steele. This is a rather strange film in which the presentation is in French and English, and alternates a few times. Perhaps this is done because pieces of dialogue have been lost? It is also quite gloomy and claustrophobic, and you do not see much more than a small circle of light that the candles and these generate, and there is a feeling of fear and imminent death practically at all times. This version (in Synapse) is also uncensored and I wondered what could be censored in a 1964 movie until I saw the topless scene, I think it could be that. Overall, this is very nice and gloomy in black and white. Barbara Steele definitely does the movie as well. 8 out of 10.
