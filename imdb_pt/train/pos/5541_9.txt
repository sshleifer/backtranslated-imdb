A highly atmospheric cheap, showing great ingenuity in the use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create a strange and moody texture. History is forced, acting is merely functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative. This film is recommended for its humor and texture, not for its history.
