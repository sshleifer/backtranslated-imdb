From the wave of Austen's films of the 90s, this is my favorite, even more so than "Persuasion", which was what turned me into Austenian. Before seeing this "Emma" I had seen two previous versions, but in one Emma everything seemed wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other she seemed half wrong, like a possible impostor, while here she seemed right, young and foolish and stubborn. In general, I thought the attitude and atmosphere of the production conveyed the romance's charm extremely well; in fact, it's one of the sweetest and best things I've ever seen, not the nature of a Christmas present. The script is exceptionally well-formed, and the add-ons of the adapter, like the beam of light that Harriet reveals to Emma in the church, all agree. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I expected, but I really liked him: he emphasizes the handy and simple side of the character, in contrast to Emma's affections, and his angry outbursts against Frank Churchill are pretty funny. . Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of almost Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emma's wardrobe is just as smooth and exactly as firm as it should be. And as in the "pride and prejudice" of the same producers, care is taken to ensure that any possible character unions can be believed - only in some cases. For me this production was and continues to be a delight.
