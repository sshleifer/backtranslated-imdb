Although not as scary as its classic cult predecessor (ZOMBIE 2) I really like it better. This is because of its faster tempo, better settings and cool 80's soundtrack. It is loaded with action and has sweetened effects by Lucius Fulci. The zombies do not look as nasty as in ZOMBIE 2, but they still look good. It was done very well, but definitely has its share of cheese; for example, some zombies move very slowly while others are as fast as ninjas. some are braindead while others say funny lines, but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How is this rad? Definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans. would probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well. Also check out Zombie 4.
