In the fifties the age restrictions for films in Brazil were as follows: without restriction, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Usually westerns were allowed for ten years, when they had a little more violence they went to 14, but it was rare to see a western restricted for under 18s. Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think that explains very well how this film was considered different from the average. The hero, James Stewart, was fighting his own brother, who had killed his father. He was looking for revenge and looked rather traumatized, away from the good average guy. Anthony Mann tried variations of this type of character in the next films he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the protagonist, was far from virtuous, continued to follow the man who remained with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains who will always be remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man who gets the rifle, is one of the most suitable for a western. It was to be turned into a Fritz Lang movie, which was not released. When it was offered to Mann, he made a point of starting from scratch again and did not pick up anything that was prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of the West, but still retaining all its traditions. Winchester is still a great movie to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made on those who saw it when it was originally released.
