I saw this movie on its release and I have valued it ever since. What a wonderful group of actors (I always think the cast is one of the most interesting aspects of a movie). I really enjoyed watching the dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn is always a joke. The script is clever, cunning and ironic, mocking almost everything "Beverley Hills". She loved the "doctor" of Paul Bartel and the servant of Ray Sharkey. That was rude and rude, but thank God! Unless you're a jerk, I highly recommend this movie. FYI for those who enjoy playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were in "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were in "Night of the Comet" together. They were all three in "Eating Raoul."
