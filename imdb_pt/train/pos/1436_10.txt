Having worked in downtown Manhattan, and often ate my lunch during the summer days in the park near the prefecture, I saw the mayor coming and going. It was great to be able to go beyond the City Hall and see what it was like in the lobby and all over the building. Al Pacino, (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", '03, gave an outstanding performance throughout the board, and especially when he delivered a speech at an African-American church for a boy who was killed. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Fugitive Jury", '03, was a servant dedicated to the mayor and worshiped him in everything he attempted to accomplish. Bridget Fonda, (Marybeth Cogan), begins to fall in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives a great supporting role. Last but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", 01, played a mafia boss who had some very difficult choices to make at the end of the photo! Great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in New York!
