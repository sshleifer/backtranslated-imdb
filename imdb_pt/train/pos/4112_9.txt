The title is onomatopoeic, the sound of a tram hitting the tracks. It is metaphorical to everyone that the people living in the dump can not have. The misery of these people is illustrated by the passing trolley, which represents the relatively unattainable rich life of the middle class. The pathos of the little boy and his beloved father, though sadly insane, are very touching. This was Kurosawa's first color film and he uses beautifully shocking colors, colors seen only in dreams. The film is surreal and surpassing in beauty. Compassion for humanity is the subaltern force, but as always, Kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film. It is a masterpiece of a movie genius.
