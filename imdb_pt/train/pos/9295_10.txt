It was hard for me to believe all the negative reviews about this movie star. I laughed through the whole picture, as did my entire family. The movie was clearly defined as an old-time gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I bet they had a good time while doing it. Of course Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great-and about these Everly sisters, each of the two Falco's, and divine music all over. Rob Reiner made a great smiling limousine driver and Gabriel Byrne, a laughable neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the character Sleepy Joe and all references to funeral homes and graves. Paul Anka was his usual entertainment, with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to do a duet of his "My Way" welcome to Vick's performance. <br /> <br /> I am of the opinion that this movie was a comedic tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I'm also of the opinion that no one of any age would even think of imitating the actions that took place in this film - it's a joke - not a terrifying gangsta movie. The cars and clothes were impressive, as was the decorative "Vic's Place". <br /> <br /> In fact, I think of "Mad Dog Time" as a musical comedy, less damaging than many cartoons, TV crime dramas. and talk shows. I would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment.
