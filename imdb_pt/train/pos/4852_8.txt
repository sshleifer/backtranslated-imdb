Now this is one of Big's Best, the only role of Jack Hulbert in 1931, divided into two for the radio team Band Waggon Askey & Murdoch. It has a great cast, which fills the game for all that is worth, especially Askey, of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatic by Richard Murdoch. <br /> <br /> The group of railway passengers stranded in the lonely country station for the night find more than they expected, spooky trains, ghostly porters, furry sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His replica with all falls between the side division and the horrible bland. When the formula works, it's very good, but sometimes it's too artificial and forced to make the film look more old-fashioned than it is. But those damn treacherous columnists - thank God that Britain does not have nowadays! <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a good harmless movie, to get back the TV screen like an old friend, but if you were expecting to be spoiled from your woods, you will probably be very disappointed!
