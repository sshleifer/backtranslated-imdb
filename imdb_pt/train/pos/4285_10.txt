This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. And yet, his appearance of a play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. A masterpiece that should not be missed (preferably with subtitles, not dubbed). <br /> <br /> In an old bus on the way to the capital Belgrade, an imminent war decides the behavior of the passengers. Two Gypsy musicians sing their miserable life, but also predict a tragedy to come; their singing divides and connects the stages in this extraordinary road movie (the real-life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with Stanojlo Milinkovic, as a farmer who razed the road, they gave a real performance). The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant picture of a society facing a war, a vision of the collective person of the nation: everyone is aware that the war is about to begin but try to live their own lives in the best way possible, hoping that ignorance avoids tragedy. . Using a simple cinematographic language, director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by the previous war (World War I), but also highlights successful personal portraits: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the veteran of the Great War. on the way to visit his newly recruited son, and gloomy predictions of a man who appears to be a German spy. <br /> <br /> Bright in his narration, with memorable soundtrack (mostly Gispsy songs) and tight, well-photographed and edited atmosphere, this feature (Sijan's debut) was only an introduction to a series of bitter director comedies which will define the Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: "Maratonci trce poconi krug", "Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiot", and my other director's favorite, "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
