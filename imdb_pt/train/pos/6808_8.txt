The 1967 film In Cold Blood was perhaps more like "the real thing" (Think about it: do we really want to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in a world of colors, and many people did not even know the which it was, and there was an opportunity to remake it for television. Also, if you redo, you can show some things not shown in the original. Truman Capote's book In Cold Blood was the first "non-fiction novel." Truman's book was not actually 100% true to the real story. I thought the Canadian location was enough for Kansas for a TV movie. Look for the elements of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll: Dick is a womanizer, Perry is addicted to aspirin, Perry plays blues guitar.
