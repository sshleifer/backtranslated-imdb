A great addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys is a movie that you do not see every day. Has excellent actors to go with a great story. This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he holds the role as he holds John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors the story is not new but the story The man (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information on a virus that swept the most of men. <br /> <br /> The actors in this show were incredible. I should mention Brad Pitt who was hilarious when mental patient James Cole (Bruce) is in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> The director did an incredible job in bringing us a disturbing picture of a devastated future. by a man-made virus. <br /> <br /> The animals seen in the world of viruses made them appear to run the world when humans are taken to underground facilities. <br /> <br /> This movie was great and must see and is also a must have. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
