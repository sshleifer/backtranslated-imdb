Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary about New York City firefighters. What they got was the only movie inside the World Trade Center on September 11. Having worked with James Hanlon's company before, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak, while Gédéon stayed in the firehouse if anything interesting happened. A plane flying low over the city distracted Jules, and he pointed the camera up, seconds before the plane crashed into Tower 1. Jules asked the captain to follow him to the Towers. The first thing he saw were two people on fire, something he refused to film. He stayed on the scene for the next few hours, filming the reactions of the firefighters and other people who were there. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers took great care not to make the film too violent, gray and bloody. But the firemen's language is a little rough, and CBS showed a lot of uncensored balls. The Naudet brothers mixed footage that they filmed with individual interviews so firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during specific times of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a similar feature-length feature, most of the money from DVD sales goes to charities related to Sept. 11. Well done, emotional, moving and completely devoid of political propaganda, it's the best documentary of its kind to this day.
