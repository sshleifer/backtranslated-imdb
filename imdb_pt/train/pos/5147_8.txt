First week of May, every year brings back memories of the holocaust, through movies on television. Among the many films they showed, this was what I had not seen. <br /> <br /> The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. It begins with his childhood and ends with the position of greater power in Germany. <br /> <br /> The film was previously presented as a TV series and then converted into a movie format. The Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and flare to give a real portrait of this man. <br /> <br /> It is a good script and narrative that educates the public about the main events that lead Hitler. in power, and also tries to show Hitler's likely psychological makeup. Is the film a biased view of director Christian Duguay? who shows Hitler as a person of a strip, menacing, angry and shouting? which had a strong influence on the Germans and the people around them. Hitler is not shown as someone who has charisma and attraction, and there the film can not convince Hitler's portrait. <br /> <br /> Although the venture was for TV, all the ingredients of the production are first class and on par with any mainstream movie. The value of production, scenery, costumes, etc. were perfect. <br /> <br /> There are many criticisms of this film, in authenticity about the historical events that are presented. But still the film is exciting, engaging and fun. Robert Carlyle dominates the screen like no one else does. Is he incredibly good? bright! I would have liked a more balanced view of Hitler's life because I think Hitler was able to bring the sleeping feelings of millions of Germans and not only he who should be blamed for the holocaust. As I said several times, this? very sadly - our society likes to guide or prosecute a person, as representative of the good or the evil of society, respectively.
