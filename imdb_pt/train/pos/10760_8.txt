"9/11," presented by Robert DeNiro, features footage from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York on September 11, 2001. Never too frightful and bloody but powerful and moving . "9/11" is a real treat. Anyone who is not moved by this television show is immune to anything. 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
