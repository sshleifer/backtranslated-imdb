I watched the trailer on DVD after watching the movie, and I think anyone who saw this before watching the movie would be very surprised and possibly disappointed. He made much of the fact that the movie was "by the director of Cube" and made it look like a horror movie, when in fact it's an absurd comedy (IMDB spelling checker does not seem to think Absurdist is a word, but it is) , reminiscent of Rosencrantz and Guilderntern are dead. <br /> <br /> I love the way the story develops slowly at first, then gradually increases. I also like the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the movie. This and the fact that the story unfolds mainly in just one set are the only aspects in which this film is similar to Cube. I recommend.
