Now, I have seen many movies in my day, but each one has been very selected some that were really good for me. And I'm a 19-year-old man who is impressed by this film directed at a younger audience. This is a very underrated gem for those who watch foreign films. Almost all the acting is believable, the graphics are decent (which you do not even care about when you watch the movie. Believe me, complaining about the graphics would be a stupid thing to do), the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can to enjoy not only children. <br /> <br /> Here's basically what this movie made me do. One, made me laugh ... a lot, two, made me feel for the characters as you should, and three, it's a very edifying story. At the end of this movie you will feel good. Of course, that anime out there did not feature some kid turning into a great warrior and anything to defeat some great evil. It is a widely used formula. But in this case, it's forgivable because even though they use puppets for some characters and some average graphics that you'd see 5 years ago, their looks are not judged. It is very touching, the ending is original and keeps it in the film as it is supposed. If you, however, try to compare this with other movies like "The Never-ending Story" or whatever, this will diversify your opinion. Watch how it is and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's been a long time since I've been so impressed. The only other movie I had this feeling was when I saw the TMNT back when it came out. There's something about this movie that I felt about the TMNT that really made me love it. So do not overanalyze or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
