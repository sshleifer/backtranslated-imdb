In this documentary we find Roger, the wealthy manager of a factory in China that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Roger claims that the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities they offer, but interviews with four of them tell a different story. The dark lives of the girls are shown in contrast to the bizarre excesses of Mardi Gras himself. Filmmaker David Redmon should be commended for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a complex of Chinese factories and for getting a revealing interview with the head of the American company that imports and sells the accounts. The film is told convincingly and clearly serves its purpose as a window to what lies behind these ubiquitous labels "Made in China".
