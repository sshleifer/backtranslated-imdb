I liked this movie when I was a child, when it left, and to this day I still do. A simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventurer literally straight from the paperback folklore. There are actors who were more recognizable in the past. This should not stop the viewer from taking a spin. Wayne Crawford stars as the main character Jake Speed. Of course, it may bite from certain elements of Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones. But this movie is done well enough to keep you out of the basement. I am surprised that many people do not know this. It must have been overshadowed by other movies in theaters in 1986. I watched it on cable. It can be difficult to find because it is sold out on VHS and DVD. I got an ebay DVD with less than 8 dollars! Cool movie.
