If you like the subtle (yes, I said subtle actions) and reactions of John Candy, you can not help liking this film (pronounced "fillum" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The inattentive (and uninformed) observer has always seen Candy as a broad actor - a great clown. And sometimes he was (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But, when given the opportunity, it can actually be sharp and rather subtle. It is a pity that he has been chosen in so many roles that he has only shown his broader side because we will never be able to see more of the other. Oh, yes, the movie. One can watch "Going Berserk" repeatedly (I know I have) with the frequency of "Caddyshack". It feels so good. The plot, though somewhat confusing, is actually quite deep for such a farce. This allows Candy and the ever less valued Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to recover from Candy ... and they point out HARD. Definitely worth a look for anyone who liked SCTV or other Candy work.
