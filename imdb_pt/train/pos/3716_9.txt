I was presented with a Cracker Bag last night before a preview of the Disney Holes. I do not know who decided to show it, but I'm really glad they did it. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a snapshot of Australia in the early 80's as seen through a child's eye. The "conversations" between Eddie and his brother were hilarious and, like the rest of the film, so realistic. Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia, since it reminded me of my own childhood (being the same age as the director probably helps a bit) and the audio multiplied the feeling. I just hope I can see the Cracker Bag again someday.
