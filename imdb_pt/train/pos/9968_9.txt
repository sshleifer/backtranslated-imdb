My mom took me to see this movie as a child and I yearn to see it every year as I do with all my other Christmas favorites. What I remember most was the Devil's idiot and Santa looking through his telescope. I waited and looked through the TV Guide. Every year thereafter to see when it would be shown. I used to find him playing on a Saturday afternoon. I only found the film in English that took something special from the film and was eager to find a copy of it in Spanish. I hold this film dear to my heart and have never suffered nightmares as others may suggest. Yes, it's a different movie about Santa and that's what makes it special and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids while I explain to them my favorite parts and memories !!
