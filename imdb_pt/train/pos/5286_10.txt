Part of what was so good about the classic designs of Looney Tunes was their irreverence and how they were not afraid to do what they wanted. In this case, Marvin, the Martian, has a quest to bring back a Terran. Sure enough, he comes across Bugs Bunny, who warns of a riot on the part of Marvin's dog. After Marvin finally traps Bugs - through an Acme stable jacket, ejecting bazooka! - Bugs have more things planned for the trip back to Mars. What I mean is, if you thought it was a big change in the Solar System when they took Pluto out of their planet status, then you still have not seen anything! Yes, "The Hasty Hare" does it all. How they buy Acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people, but the point here - I mean, "hare" - is to have fun. And believe me, you definitely will. After all, a little space never hurt anyone.
