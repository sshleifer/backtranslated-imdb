This is the silly movie of a thinking man. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, this can turn into a cult classic for you as it did for my wife and I - to cast the "voice" of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as Martians to the overly simplistic populace. of Big Bean this is a movie that you can sleep or watch carefully and enjoy anyway. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone but if you enjoy relaxing the easy mood that takes the quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie.
