The best Cheech & Chong movie so far !! Of all Cheech and Chong this is the right one so far. I think I've seen them all at least twelve times, and I love them all. But this is definitely the best. Compared to others, it covers many themes and gives lots of good laughs. Some of the texts are still part of our language today, after 25 years. I hope one day they can make another, because they are still great comedians. I hear they're writing a new script, so who knows ... I think these guys are the ones who managed to make decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever saw one of them ...
