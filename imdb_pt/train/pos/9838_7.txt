Born Again is an episode of Season 1. The part of reincarnation, in my opinion, is legal. The more I watch, the more I like it, but it will never stay above "Very Good" for me. Even if it is not very memorable, I will always remember this as the episode of reincarnation. Anyway, now I'm going to tell you what's good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> O Bom: Oragami. Oh Yeah! <br /> <br /> That aquarium was cool. =] <br /> <br /> Thrown out of a window. Very sophisticated. x] <br /> <br /> The Bad: Marry your best friend's wife! O_O <br /> <br /> What a random choice to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> Why did the guy who died with the wrapped handkerchief try to take off his scarf? <Br/> Conclusion: Okay, episode is not very memorable. 7/10
