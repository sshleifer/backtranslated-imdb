I remember coming across this special while surfing in 1965. I had never heard of Barbra before. When the show ended, I thought, "This is probably the best TV thing I've ever seen in my life." 42 years later, this is true. Yet there is nothing as surprising, as honestly as surprising as the talent that has been displayed here. You can talk about all the super stars you want, this is the most superlative of all! <br /> <br /> You name it, it succeeds. Comedy, pathetic, sensual seduction, ballads, Barbra is truly a storyteller. Her ability to pull out anything she tries is legendary. But this special was done in the beginning and helped to create the legend that it quickly became. Despite having grown so much time in so little time, she kept the promise, revealing more of her talents over time. But they're all here from the beginning. You will not be disappointed to see this.
