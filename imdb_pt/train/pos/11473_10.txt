Zero Day is a movie that few people could see, and what a shame that is. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end where the two main characters descended on the room and mercilessly kill people, then they committed suicide and it made me get my stomach. I was shaking, it's how strong this movie is. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredible. It's too incredible not to get a perfect ten. It's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this movie. It's not a budget that makes a good movie, it's the amount of feeling that manufacturers put into it, which makes it good. <br /> <br /> It leaves a permanent impression on your mind that you just can not get out. This makes you realize the true horror of shootings - especially if you knew this person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour for those who feel mature enough to watch. I'm fourteen and I feel like this movie is too awesome to be put into words. It seems like you're watching something that really happened.
