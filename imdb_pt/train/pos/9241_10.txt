Hey guys, all right. I'm the man, the first and only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ........ you can not really write a comment about Sakura script, because there we do not have one. As far as I know, the story was invented as we continue. I had the best time of my life making that movie, and I was so stinky I was without Jism ........... fun times. So happy that you all liked the movie. I really could not do the fights I had imagined. Every time I made some moves, the fight director continued to change them. Still, I had a great time and met really good people. Especially the purple female ninja who seems to have fallen on the movie scene.
