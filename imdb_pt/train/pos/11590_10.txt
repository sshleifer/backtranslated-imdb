Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting films. I was more of a movie goer then. Now I like to rent movies and relax in my house instead of going to the theater. I also saw this short, "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been looking for this movie for years. It was truly inspiring. Surprisingly, I finally managed to gather more information from your site. Thanks .... I'm surprised to find that this short film was an opening for a picture of Disney. I also did not remember the Disney movie. I did not even remember it was an opening movie for Disney. I really wish they would show it on TV someday. I wonder if Disey owns the rights to this movie? Is it available on DVD? This is a must see for all generations !!!
