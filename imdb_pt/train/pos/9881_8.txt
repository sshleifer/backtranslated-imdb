In western Hollywood, those hands of the trail were a rude group that, when they arrived at the city, celebrated quite resistant. After all, driving on tracks was a lonely business in the past, before railroads reached all parts of the US. <br /> <br /> The drovers who worked for trail boss Gil Favor, played by Eric Fleming, were no different. But Fleming was a man of all business, he had a job to do and hired a superior team to do that. <br /> <br /> With the long run of Rawhide and the fact that regulars stayed with him most of the time, we met all the drovers at some point. Some of the story lines were focused on all of them, although most were Rowe Yates, Fleming's character and Clint Eastwood, number 2 of the herd. <br /> <br /> The Western image of Clint Eastwood was shaped by Rawhide, It is a pity that these are not shown more often. Probably because they were made in black and white. If this were an NBC show, this would have been done in color like Bonanza and would be running as often as these shows. We could see so much more of a man who became a legend of the movement. <br /> <br /> Ironically, it was Eric Fleming who left the show before closing to make movies. He did a few of them and was hoping that the show would give him a name for a movie. Unfortunately he was killed at a movie spot making an action movie, drowned in a river. If he had lived, he might have become a name like Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> Clint took over as head of trail last season, and then the show completed his run. And he, of course, became the icon he is today and not just the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough western that had some tough guys. No frills, these cowboys worked only doing a job and fighting against the elements and situations in which they were played every year. <br /> <br /> They do not really do TV shows like these anymore. What a pity.
