An impeccable premise of 'race against time' - It is discovered that John Doe murdered has pneumonic plague, while the health authority and NOPD struggle against each and every one trying to find their contacts on the waterfront, the killers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding on to them. <br /> <br /> This movie is available for free on the Internet Archive and is worth downloading. Much (everything?) Of this film was filmed in genuinely New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at what is now period detail, though to me it seems under-exposed, even to noir - perhaps furniture lighting equipment so were not what are. There is also plenty of background noise from the location, which is a little disturbing - car horns on the love scene, anyone? There are many non-professional support artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pace of the film is a bit flaccid - there is not much chance of resumption or rework, though the final quest is worth it. There is also not much wrong with the main actors: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a clever and charismatic psychopath - the later scene, while he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin, is great, while Widmark, as he always did, casts a fair anger the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone should redo this - no supernatural, no mysticism, no special effects, just a good thread full of character conflict and a topic topic. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and this is noticeable with the number of eccentric types of New Orleans stuffing this sombre, sloppy drama against the clock. There is even a dwarf newspaper salesman. <br /> <br /> "Community? What community do you think you are living in the Middle Ages?"
