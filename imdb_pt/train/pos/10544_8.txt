Well, "Cube" (1997), Vincenzo's first movie, was one of the most interesting and complicated ideas I've ever seen when we talk about movies. They had just one scene, a lot of actors and a plot. So what made him so special was all the effective direction, great dialogues and a bizarre condition that the characters had to deal with like rats in a maze. His second film, "Cypher" (2002), was about his story, but it was not as good as "Cube", but here are the characters being tested as mice again. <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is something very interesting and causes Vincenzo to return to his "Cube days", locking the characters once again in a very different space, with no time to play with the characters, like play with mice in an experience room. But instead of a science fiction thriller (even some of the wrong teasers and promotional trailers looked like this), "Nothing" is a loose and light comedy that surely can be called modern satire about our society and also about the intolerant world . was living. Once again Vicenzo surprises us with a great idea on such a small kind of thing. 2 actors and a blinding white setting, is all you have most of the time and you do not need more than that. While "Cube" is a claustrophobic experience and confusing "Cypher", "Nothing" is quite the opposite, but at the same time also desperate. <br /> <br /> This movie proves yet again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget. Of course the movie fails a few times, but its main idea means a lot and it makes up for any flaws. There is nothing more to be said about this movie because everything is a brilliant surprise and a totally different experience that I have had in films since "Cube".
