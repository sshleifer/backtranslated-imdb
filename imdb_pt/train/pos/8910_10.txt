Most of the Atomic Age monster movies that I watched on television as a child - and some of them, The included BLOB, scared the daylights out of me. Films like INVADERS FROM MARS made it very clear to us "little fritters" that children were unreliable when it came to things like things invading the home world; The BLOB only reiterated this fact. I remember, fondly, late afternoons stretched out on the floor, watching the Body Snatchers, Martian Invaders, and Blobs infiltrate an unsuspecting society. It was one summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) conducted an Atomic-Age classic every weekend. It was 16mm, and most were black and white (and the projector was noisy), and the BLOB's "colored" print had faded to a faint pink - but, man, it was fun. I dragged my mother and she liked it as much as I did. It was there, in that science museum, that I really fell in love with the BLOB. The filmmaker's intention was, of course, to make money - but it was the sincerity of everyone involved, from the filmmakers to the "talent" (players), who made me fall in love with this film. Corny? You bet. Cheesy? They do not get any cheesier. But man, what a movie!
