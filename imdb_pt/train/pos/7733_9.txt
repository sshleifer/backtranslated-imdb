Foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is apparently "perfectly" embedded. Shot by shot, edited by editing, the film unfolds around a troubled boxer discovering his own purpose (or lack thereof). The other reviews around, perhaps, indicate a lack of pulp interest, but I personally think this is a superbly cinematic piece together!
