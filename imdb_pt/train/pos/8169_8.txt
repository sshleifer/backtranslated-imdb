This is a bloody and quite convincing mess. Corbin Bernson is very in charge of this film with his smooth portrait of the wacky eponymous wacky practitioner of wacky control. Linda Hoffman plays her cheating wife and she is very easy on the eyes - unfortunately for her, the small "date" with the pool face brings severe punishment in a way that the good doctor knows best - what a shame with that beautiful smile! The last half hour of the film is dedicated to Bernson's character losing completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress named Virginya Keehne. An extremely talented artist, she is in the spotlight from the moment the suspenders come out. Beautiful legs too!
