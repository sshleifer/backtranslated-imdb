I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared in 1993. I was 8 years old at the time, and now at 22 years of age it seems strange to have seen this cult show start and end and look back. suddenly seem so far away, what a great decade. Anyway I used to watch MonsterVision all the time, as I'm a big fan of horror movies and horror movies. It was like the '90s version of the Chiller Theater. If MST3K gets the DVD's, why not Joe Bob's show, at least MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Many comments and information from Joe Bob about the movies were hilarious. Most of the films shown on the show were either type B or C, but featured many house movies, as well as the first-rate Hammer films from England, as well as many with Ray Harryhausen's majesty. Many have been eccentric movies that you would not see anywhere like the Japanese science fiction films, in addition to Godzilla, which is familiar to almost everyone and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade of preservation of films and more independent directors, I think MonsterVision would be a good show for IFC, since they've had success with the IFC Grind House Show. I'm sure that this show will be resumed for nostalgic reasons someday, I think it will have to wait and see. Until then "this is great television"!
