Holes, the novel, was forced on me in an education course. I did not think I would like a children's novel; Also, the other couple of books that I was forced to read to the class was very bad. But, to my surprise, I simply loved Holes. It's really one of the most perfectly written novels I've ever read. I think it has the rare quality that makes it attractive to pre-teens, teens and adults. Everyone who reads, I think, will walk away from a better person. Although I can not say that for the film, I'm glad to say they got it right most of the time. I do not think moviegoers will shy away from being enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effect of being more stupid when they sit down. It's a smart story and it's very well told. I think it moves a little too fast. The novel takes more time in character development. And flashbacks come and go so quickly that they do not have much time to register. Interracial romance in the past seems more clich√© and banal than romance. And the end, which connects all the loose wires, seems very ridiculous. It's exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of the absurd that does not exist in the film. This works much better. I also do not like the crowd of pop songs. I wish Disney would not feel the need to sell soundtracks. The cast is excellent for all tastes, from young to old professionals. Jon Voight is especially great. I'm not sure why we need Catwoman and Fonze, though. 9/10
