Eight simple rules began as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character Paul Hennessey and the relationship he had with his kids was the best part of the show. I've always preferred Kerry to Bridget, Bridget's been done before, Kerry's quite unique and I can relate to her in a number of ways, though I'm not sure I liked the direction her character did in later series. <br /> <br /> The first episodes were fun, good and simple teenage plans about Paul and Cate disciplining the kids, however I think the show lost its sparkle when John Ritter died. I admired the cast and crew for wanting to continue the series, but when it died, I felt the show did that. For me, the purpose of the show was based on the guide to the 8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter. It was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and angle of the show changed without Hennessey's father. . Bridget seemed to be more annoying, Rory remained the same and Cate was always giving her life lessons that once seemed funnier when everything was left for Paul. I think the grandfather is funny (especially when he's watching Great Escape), but I feel that C.J is unnecessary for the show. He's funny in parts, but I felt that the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedy series. Over all the younger ones are not bad just lack excitement and someone finds it annoying that Cate works at school and C. J and grandpa is always there too? I always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and worth seeing for Paul and Kerry but the latest ones were average at best.
