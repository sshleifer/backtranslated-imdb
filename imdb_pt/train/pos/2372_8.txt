I only watched it after my mother brought it back from America to me, I was dreading watching this after all the negative comments here, but I have to say, yes, the acting is tacky, some of the effects are laughable. <br /> <br /> But you have to remember that this was to be 1898 not 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was very good. I liked this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I read the book so many times, and found myself going "ahh yes that's in the book" almost all the time, with the other version almost nothing of the book existed. <br /> <br /> So well done, at least trying to make a true version.
