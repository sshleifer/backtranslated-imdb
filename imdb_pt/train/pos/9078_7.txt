Overall, the plot was much better than I expected. The laughing lane was a bit boring at times and tended to get in the way; however, there were enough real laughs in this episode to make up for that. My biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations that were not shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best way in the previous promotions, but his character does well in the pilot. There are enough to please almost everyone and all the regular characters seem to be ahead of them. Now, if writers can live by what they started.
