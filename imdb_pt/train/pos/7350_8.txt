Well, I was a teenager when I saw the movie ... the songs were a big hit, but the elite skipped govinda movies back then because watching govinda and karishma movies (aka karizma) was not the kind of "class", but Either way Many people liked it as the series of these movies rocked the 90s through out and most of them were successful. Today I was watching again after a long time and I remembered, there was a long of people and the riot that they created when the music to and uo uo came on the screen .... the dresses of govinda and karishma were complementary to each other (the worst duo to wear of that time) well karisma in the late 90s transformed but govinda was still very faithful for her stylist as her sense of dress remains the same ... but at that time everything was mixed was all good ... everything worked and gradually the elite realized what fun was missing and then ... there was no turning back to this jodi as it was in n making those Indians continue series ..hated by some, but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time with nothing to do to rent it or watch it on TV I do not think you will regret it ... but remember it is the worst at its best .. I still watch these movies when I have time because I can not stop laughing ... so I say go ahead and have a good time as there are times when we all love stupidity and especially when it is done by the kings of your times it is certainly watchable ... I recommend it to all movie lovers ...
