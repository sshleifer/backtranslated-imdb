Even without a word, Billy Connely is wonderful as a zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mommy", even better. Girlfriends zombies? <br /> <br /> "... My dad tried to eat me ... I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's like the plane meets (meats?) Night of the undead, sponsored by Zomcom .. <br /> <br /> And do not forget my head coffin <br /> <br /> And Fido in one Aloha shirt is cool! <br /> <br /> And yes, the social commentary is too much to start commenting on. <br /> <br /> Just say that everything really works!
