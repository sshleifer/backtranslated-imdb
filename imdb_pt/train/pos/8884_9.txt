I really liked the '60s. Not being from this generation (I'm waiting for "The 80's") it was interesting to see a single four-hour capsule for that time. <br /> <br /> A major problem in the film, however, was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of families. According to promos that I saw for the movie on NBC, the story was basically about two families struggling with problems in 1960's America. Now, I may have missed something, but I think we learned more about the white family than the family African American <br /> <br /> I really think the 60s use the music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the (all very talented) actors. This is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours) of the miniseries. Very good movie!
