Part of the pleasure I got from this film came from the fact that I knew nothing more about it than it starred John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons to watch), it was a period piece and it involved chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. So I will not give much more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is magnificent as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and in combination with him step by step as the strong-minded woman who is attracted to him. It's about love and obsession, instead of the venerated board game and after drawing me gradually in the first half hour, has become totally convincing. And I challenge someone to guess the ending.
