This is one of those movies that, after watching it, you will continue to think and come back even months after seeing it. The acting is spectacular for starring two kids (I usually hate acting movies with crying child). Bill Paxton is amazing, his directing debut is even better than I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is "Game Over, Man! Game Over!" (from the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is the dichotomy between the scenes in which the actors play a family and when they are doing their "work". This really makes the movie credible and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I'll be waiting for more movies than I'm sure to love!
