I've been a Star Trek fan since I remember. When they announced the planning and the debut of the fifth grade, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The premiere of the Enterprise was worth waiting for. It was well done with the perfect scenery and great acting work done by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect ship to show the beginning of what many people have come to love. <br /> <br /> Scott Bakula was superior to Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave a command performance as Subcommander T'Pol. That only two people of this wonderful new crew are going to boldly take us into the great Starfleet story. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise looks like it's going to be a good series worth watching, and I recommend it. Watch.
