A boy with ideals who tries to change things around him. A boy who is forced to become a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and who is violating the rights of existence. A boy who, inspired by Martin Luther King, stands up and tells the truth. A family that is crumbling and struggling against it. A movie that you can not hide. You see things, and you hear things, and you feel things, that you until the day you die, hope will never have really happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, and a kid with, I'm sorry, balls, a boy who does not accept things, who does not let anything happen to him, a boy with power, and a boy who acts as a professional, as if he had never done anything else, he takes care of this movie to the end, and anyone who wants to see how the abuse happened in the '60s.
