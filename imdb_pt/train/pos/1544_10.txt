This is an excellent but difficult to find trippy World War I espionage thriller in the inimitable Italian style of the 60s. From the psychedelic graphics of Ennio Morricone's introductory credits and soundtrack to the lesbian scene of love with Capucine and the elaborate scenes apocalyptic battles of anyone with poison gas and German cavalry in gas-proof 'storm trooper' equipment, this is a film that should not be missed. It is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the cruelty of players on and off the battlefield. In addition to the battle scenes, some of the special effects and production are primitive, apparently because most of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes, but for movie lovers of the 60s this should not be a problem. I saw this movie for the first time on television for many years and had the acumen of recording it on VHS. I still have the tape and I like watching it again from time to time.
