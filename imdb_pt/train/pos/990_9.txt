I really liked this movie. Of course the idea is well out there ... the federal government has arranged a tracking device implanted in the jawbone of a small thief to lure a more dangerous hacker / computer thief out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, the man the Feds "volunteered" to deploy with the device, is a very nice person and ends up being a lot of fun getting his head in with him for a while. Alvin turns out to be much more than a humorous but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not as easily manipulated as he looks. Definitely worth watching.
