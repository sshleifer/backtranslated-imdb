I honestly think this was the best version of the war of the worlds I've ever seen. It was funny, but it was also educational. I learned a lot from the movie and if I could I would do for this movie. my favorite part was when the soldiers died in the robot and another came right behind him. in the last movie war in the world, I think it should have been more like the first one and would have been better. but anyway I give this movie two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> And if they make another movie like that, I'm definitely going to watch it. Thank you
