My choice for the best film ever was Laughton's "Night of the Hunter," which remains superb in my canon. But, it may have been supplanted by "Shower," which is the most artistically Taoist movie I have ever seen. The way to care for others is represented by the flow of water, and the way in which water can be made of inspiration and comfort, and cleanliness, and so on. is the essence of the Tao. It is possible to argue that the themes of NOFTH and Shower are similar, and that Lillian Gish in the first represents the purest form of Christianity, since spa operators represent the purest form of Taoism. I would not argue in any way against such an interpretation. Both films are visual joys in their integration of idea and image. However, the shower presents a view so little stylized of the sacredness of everyday life that I give her the nod. I revere both.
