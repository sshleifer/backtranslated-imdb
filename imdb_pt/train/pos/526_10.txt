If someone questions whether cinema is an art form, you can do something worse than pointing them out in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's simply the perfect combination of history, script, actors and cinematography already compromised with celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a condemned bomber pilot who is lost by his celestial conductor in the English fog during World War II, and his subsequent brushes with the celestial authorities (or is in his head) is played with brio by David Niven and Kim Hunter and is incredibly touching - especially in the opening scenes when the condemned pilot (Niven) describes his situation to the terrestrial radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> The sense of another world is heightened by the photograph of Jack Cardiff and the incredible production drawings. <br /> <br /> The supreme touches extend to the celestial shots that appear in black and white and earthly scenes presented in Technicolor - this is even mentioned by the celestial ruler (a fantastic Marius Goring). <br /> <br /> Not just a high point in British cinema, but a high point in cinema, period.
