I watched almost all the Gundam / Mech anime that has shown in the US and this by far has the best story. The way the plot turns and turns has been riveted. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-old boys who have been trained to pilot state-of-the-art mobile equipment known as Gundams. Gundam pilots were trained to fight a powerful insurgency known as Oz. When things start to heat up between the OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and the old ones will dissipate. Ancient conflicts will end and new ones will arise. For peace, Gundam pilots must face the events that are taking place in their world and put an end to all fighting. But as far as people are willing to go to get their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep storyline.
