Yes commitment. Let's say that "Fever Pitch" might lead you to believe it's a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you do not have to be a baseball fan to really enjoy this photo of the Farrelly brothers. But of course, if you are one, you will have even more fun; with all the references (quite accurate, I would say) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet history; of the Bambino Curse and all that is attributed to him, including those two words that you CAN NOT pronounce in front of a Boston fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon play two people who can often have second thoughts about entering into a relationship: the successful workaholic who is also rich in finding a schoolteacher? The thing is, the character of Fallon wins the heart of Barrymore being funny, affectionate, sweet and absolutely perfect. But her friends ask a logical question: if he is such a caretaker, why is he still in the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He has been so committed to his team since his uncle passed his Sox tickets to him; he has never missed a Red Sox home game at Fenway Park for a long time. <br /> <br /> And that delicate balance, how much the workaholic is willing to give up the obsession of his face; and how much that crazed baseball teacher willing to commit to keep the OTHER love of his life, is what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> At first you may think that the obsession for sports pieces of the film are exaggerated for comic relief. Well, I'm sad to admit, they're not. I, as a fan of the Houston Astros, can say they are all true. I would try in all available ways to view all Stros games; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet. I read the sports section of the Chronicle every day. And yes, my room looks like the gift shop of The Shed, Minute Maid Park; with a closet full of Astros equipment, including 5 shirts, 20 shirts and you know the rest. The character of Fallon even has the MasterCard MBNA Red Sox. Fallon was quite credible as the Red Sox fanatic, even though he could do it without becoming a cartoon (thank goodness Adam Sandler was not in it); and the plot revolves around how this couple tried to deal with each other's passions. <br /> <br /> I would say it will be a classic romantic comedy. Not enough to be among the best films in history; but it certainly breaks a mold in the genre and is attractive enough for both men and women.
