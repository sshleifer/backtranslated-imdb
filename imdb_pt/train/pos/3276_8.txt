49. PAPERHOUSE (thriller / horror, 1988) Sick in bed with an 11-year-old Anna (Charlotte Burke) has only her drawings to keep her company. Her health deteriorates progressively as a series of mysterious 'black outs' grabs her. In each of these episodes, she dreams of a house in a desolate field, with only a sick and invalid boy named Marc (Elliot Spiers) inhabiting it. When an unknown danger threatens his idyllic "paper house," Marc's life is at stake. Your life is also in danger, for these dreams reflect your own state of health. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Haunting the first feature film by British director Bernard Rose. Drawn from a fable ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr, it leaves many other "original" fantasy works in its wake. Whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares, it's hard to give the fable and reality mix to make it work in film form. Director Rose successfully captures the fantasy world of children, along with a darkness that seeks to usurp them. <br /> <br /> Fabulously marked by Phillip Glass, Rose knows how to use music wisely with a skillfully timed time jump. moments. Most thrillers are very sloppy in this very important aspect of scaring the public into not knowing what the next scene will bring. I also like the way he captures the suspense and never lets up or hesitate slowly in the next sequence of events. In addition, his mastery of putting objects into the picture (as in his P.O.V.shots) gives cinematography an additional dimension that it otherwise would not seem to have. In Europe alone you will find places that look as sinister as those presented here: the lonely house, the fields, coastal towns, watchtower, etc. Rose would follow this film with "Candyman" (1992), a true horror of the 'thinking person' and an authentic cult horror favorite.
