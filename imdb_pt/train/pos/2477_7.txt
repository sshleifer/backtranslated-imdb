As epic as it is, Kenneth Branagh's monumental interpretation of what is perhaps William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of his four-hour playing time and certainly has some real staying power. Two entirely separate sessions would probably be better, in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high-class cinema. Although I absolutely recognize this masterpiece as such, I must confess a lack of enthusiasm for the exuberance of the bards, their rhetoric (and he gives himself so well) and his many flourishes. Thus, "Hamlet" loses its impact as it loses control. <br /> <br /> From Patrick Doyle's music to Alex Thomson's cinematography to Tim Harvey's exquisite sets, the film is a feast of visual and aural delights, which complements a fine. fused. Branagh took three huge blankets, adapting, driving, and playing. His adaptation is superb, his direction is strong, but when he came to the role of Hamlet, the tension seemed to be appearing; yet he does a good job at what is an incredibly draining role. Derek Jacobi swallows the sinister Claudius with joy, and Julie Christie is more dramatic as his queen, Gertrude. Richard Briers is wonderful as Polonius, and Charlton Heston is once again a strong influence on the screen as the King player. Many others pass by, including Jack Lemmon (superb in a very small role), Billy Crystal, Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. The acting award must go to one of the great discoveries of recent years, Kate Winslet. Ophers is a poignant portrait of the most tragic figure in this whole affair, Ophelia. <br /> <br /> To finish (before this review continues more than the film), I must say that it is the length that really tests the film. viewer in this movie. Branagh directed with purpose, giving many important and shocking scenes. Many of them exceed your welcome. Watching this movie is a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we receive from it. "Neither lender nor debtor be" or "Be true to yourself." And of course: "To be or not to be." <br /> <br /> The first two hours take a little bit of perseverance, but if you can stay tuned, you will surely have a stimulating end to it. momentum of the tragic funeral on. <br /> <br /> Monday, June 8, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon
