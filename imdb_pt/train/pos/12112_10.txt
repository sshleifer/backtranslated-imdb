The premise of this anime series is about bread, of all things to base a plot on! I really laughed. The main character has a special power to make bread with which he was born, and he goes to school to bake bread. I wish it was available on DVD, and it does not matter if it's captioned or dubbed - it feels so good. Even the theme song alone is funny. At one point in the theme song, there is an Afro-Japanese man with an Afro on horseback, wielding a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword. These images will not make sense unless you see the anime. You'll laugh until your sides hurt. It's definitely the most original anime I've seen so far.
