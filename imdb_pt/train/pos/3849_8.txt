This latest Dutch film by Verhooven made me laugh. As a movie aficionado looking for all the little details and cross references etc in any movie, I can assure anyone interested in the cinematographic art that this piece entertains all the senses. I have not read Gerard Reves' book on which the film is based, but I still believe we have a sincere picture of a somewhat egocentric poet / writer who gets his (in a way - without ruining it here). An anti-hero surrounded by characters who have their ambiguous intentions, like him. All this in a superbly packed cinematography, Paul Verhopven manages to transform the "gesellich (?)" Dutch locales into a thrilling movie-noir environment, an impressive job!
