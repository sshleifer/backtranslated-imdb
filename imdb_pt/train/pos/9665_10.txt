Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives it to her every time she's on stage. Whether we're laughing at her jokes and pranks or wiping her eyes at the tensions of one of her tremendous ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can not see live (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to see is how your voice has changed and matured over the years, but it has never lost its power. Her more "vocally correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in the spirit of THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, here she's just purer and more sincere than ever. I will enjoy this concert for a long time.
