Once you see this cute little comic movie, you're sure to feel better. Hope that Yves B. Pelletier has given birth to this small and magnificent film moment, which according to me, will be recognized as a landmark film of the year 2004 for Quebec. The actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon present a touching performance. I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives to those whom Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain gave me. So if you liked Jean-Pierre Jeunet's magnificent film, I'd say you should also like the first Yves B. Pelletier film Les Aimants
