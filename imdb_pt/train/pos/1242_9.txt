I love this movie. It is well written and acted and has good cinematography. The story combines action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with great scenarios and beautiful locations. See, buy, show to your friends. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and Murphy does a great job portraying the reluctant / unlikely hero. I liked all the characters and found them interesting and well-developed with dynamic interactions. I cared about what happened to these people, and while the outcome was fairly predictable (the good guys win, the hero becomes the incredibly attractive girl, and the holy child saves lives - who does not see it?), It still made me happy when everything worked well in the end. Thank God the dignity of this movie has never been ruined with a low quality sequel. Grab some popcorn, snuggle on the couch and watch this fun, happy and fun movie.
