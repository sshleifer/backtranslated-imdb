This really is an excellent movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that should not be missed by any fan of French New Wave or Underground film. There are almost no opening or closing credits - we are just thrown into the world of consumer art, revolution and youth. This movie has little to do with documentary and is more interesting to play with our advertising ideas and their relationship with reality. Real and non-real lines are crossed in a familiar way with films that discuss documentary, but this time we do this to consume and market, not to describe the real.
