Cinderella was one of the first films I saw, and for me it's timeless. It's a lovely movie with beautiful animations. My favorite animation scene was the dress scene - I just love those rats. The songs are also lovely, not as good as those of Snow White, but they are a delight to sing and remind Tchaikovsky. A dream is a wish and then it is love? are highlights. The characters are also a delight. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the rats provided great comic relief. The sisters were also well made, just like Lucifer. But I loved the stepmother the best, she was really bad, compared to a great character on behalf of the fairy godmother. True, the movie drags a little, with the antics of the rats, but they were genuinely funny, so I do not care. I do not think it's overrated, underrated, do not you mean? He rarely plays on television, but the really bad sequence is made on Cinemagic regularly. If you want a great adaptation of Cinderella, try the wonderful Ever After, or the luxurious Slipper and Rose, which are not so good. But whatever you do, avoid the sequel, which I have the mistake of possessing, because you will thank me. 9/10 Bethany Cox
