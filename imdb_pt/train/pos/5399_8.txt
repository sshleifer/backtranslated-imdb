Gosha's last great film of the 60s. A resolute stylist with a great sense of purpose for his films, Gosha joined Shintaro Katsu (of Zatoichi's fame) to produce this blunt accusation of senseless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (heavenly judgment) is the word that those loyal to the emperor cry out as they murder enemies or "traitors" of the cause. Katsu interprets his character's simple loyalty to a manipulative politician, all in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who questions the politician is labeled a "traitor" and becomes a target of murder. <br /> <br /> One of the best photographed films of all time, many are amazing compositions of color, shape and light. The fight scenes are frequent and very bloody and brutal. The blood becomes part of the color palette that Gosha uses for his images. Beautiful and disturbing. Although personal history is simple to follow, the historical background is complicated and while a basic history lesson for this period in Japan is very useful, you can fight without the movie. The few drawbacks of the film are the music track, the length and the occasional landscape of Katsu chewing. He has a drunken scene that is way above the top for a movie but in fact it is a very accurate representation of a drunk. <br /> <br /> Downbeat, but one of the great chambara films.
