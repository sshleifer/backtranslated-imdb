DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in busy France, even if his ability to compensate is not there. However, it attacks the weakest among the population. The images and cinematography are superb and give a macabre feel additional to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and selfless, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A movie that certainly will not be forgotten by the viewer. Congratulations to Mr. Serrault for his chilling portrait.
