I got it on the plate last night. I like the movie. I traveled to Russia 3 different times (adopting our 2 children). I can not put my finger exactly because I liked this movie, besides seeing "bad" turn "good" and "good" turn "semi-bad." I liked the look of Ben Chaplin throughout the movie. Like "I can not believe this is happening to me" whether it's good or bad, the same look (and it works). Great finish. 7/10 Rent or pick up the dish like I did.
