There have been many productions of Jane Eyre's films, each with aspects to recommend them, but I suspect that this is what people will still be discovering and falling in love with for decades from now. It's just a classic (and offers so much more of history than the others). Timothy Dalton is totally in his element as Rochester, rarely losing his mark; his performance is incredibly agile and multicolored, without ever straying too far from the dark complexities of the character. The voice of Zelah Clarke is more cerebral than supernatural, but she plays a perfect role for Dalton (who properly masters her!) The nuances of her performance improve a second time (after absorbing the shock of Dalton's charisma) ). There are some technical failures and some times when production values ​​could have been better; although this was practically top-notch by BBC standards of the time. But it's the performances that are the real pleasure. Do not miss this!
