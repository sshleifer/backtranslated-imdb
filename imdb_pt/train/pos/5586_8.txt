Eva (Hedy Lamarr) has just married an older man and on the honeymoon, she realizes that her husband does not want her. His disappointment with marriage and the deprivation of love causes Eve to return to her father's house on a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, his horse escapes with his clothes and a young worker recovers and returns them to Eva. They fall in love for each other and become lovers. Later, the husband misses her and tries to take Eva back home. Eva refuses and luck brings the trio to the same place, terminating the case in a tragic way. I just watched "Extase" for the first time, and the first observation I have is about the horrible quality of VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the movie is only 75 minutes long, and it seems that different movie rolls were used . There are some totally damaged parts and other parts very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if he has the chance to find this rare VHS in rental or sale. The film is practically a silent film, the story is very old and has few lines. Consequently, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very bold, with the exposure of beautiful breasts Hedy Lamarr and naked fat body to the current standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical used in the flowers, symbolizing the interplay between Eva and her lover. The way the director leads the scenes to show Eva's needs and deprivations is very clear. The inconclusive ending is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. I liked this movie, but I hope one day you get a chance to see a restored version of 87 minutes. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ecstasy" ("Ecstasy")
