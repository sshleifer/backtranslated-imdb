This game is very addictive, I kept playing for hours until late into the night but also the fact that you can not save a game when you are in space contributed to this, sometimes I just had to play not to lose all game data. <br /> <br /> So yes, "Freelancer" is addictive, but also quite flawed. Also, for example, something that bothered me so much was that you could not skip any of the scenes with the result that sometimes you had to watch the same scene from minute to minute. A great opportunity for me to do multitasking to check my email or chat with my friends and more like that while I had to wait for the scene to be cut off. <br /> <br /> The story starts off promising, but the more you stay, the more ridiculous everything gets. Besides, the game also ends quite abruptly, at least for me. It is obvious that they are insinuating a future sequence. I do not know if a sequel is in progress at the moment, but I'm sure I'll probably pick one as soon as it's released. <br /> <br /> The gameplay is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. To put it boldly, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are very difficult and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to finish this game, which may be a bit too short. But thanks to God for the multiplayer option! It allows you to continue to play short missions, just like the one-player game once you complete it. <br /> <br /> Although many missions are the same, it just feels cool to be in the same place. In the midst of massive battles, sometimes. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but they are nothing revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> Addictive game, but beware of your flaws. <br /> <br /> 7/10
