I'm going to go out on a limb, and actually defend "Shades of Gray" as a good clip-show episode that plunged into the life and death struggle of Commander William Thomas Riker who was battling a terminally fatal disease. Scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented very well with Riker's humor when he was reviving his romantic episodes like "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder." Tragic moments were highlighted, such as Tasha's death in "Skin of Evil" as well as heartbeat danger elements in "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and the "Skin of Evil" mentioned above. Riker also displayed courage under the fire, telling some humorous jokes, like "An ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlesnake once ... after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died." This episode highlighted Will Riker's psychological ordeal under extreme pressure. And, yes, I am inclined in my opinion to proclaim "Shades of Gray" as a solid episode, because at the time of its original showing, my face was covered with sweat, wondering whether or not Riker would come alive and alive to see other great galactic adventures in outer space beyond the final frontier ... Of course, in subsequent years it seems that I have formed a singular opinion about this particular episode ... but if a prize should go to "the best episode of clip show in the history of television," then I believe this episode should be highly regarded in this regard.
