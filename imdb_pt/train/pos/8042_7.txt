**** SPOILERS **** The movie "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary United States gunman Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. The unassuming Mr. Mister Rogers speaking softly has accumulated a score of up to 300 confirmed and unconfirmed deaths of Vietcong and North Vietnam during his two "Nam" tours. What shows just how deadly and effective a truly trained military shooter Tom Berenger is legal and deadly as Sgt. Thomas Beckett, who is at the end of his career as one of the best snipers in the United States, but who later on in the film perceives that a life like a civilian will be meaningless. Since there is nothing out for him to do with his skills he learned in the US Marines, unless he decides to become a mafia killer. Backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a professional killer for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie "Sniper" is focused on Sgt.Beckett with the help of former silver medalist and US government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane, being sent into the Panamanian jungle. The two snipers must defeat rebel general Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa, and Colombian drug lord Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, who is supporting him in a planned military occupation of the country. <br /> <br /> We saw earlier in the film Sgt. Beckett scope and get a rebel leader that I think was the best scene in "Sniper". For this shows step by step as the sergeant. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. There is also a sub-plot that was later aborted in the film about a DeSilva rebel shooter, Eward Wiley, who was chasing Beckett and later killed Papich, as both were waiting to be pulled out of the jungle by a military helicopter. You would have thought that a cat and a deadly rat were being thrown out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but the sergeant. Beckett had no problem dispatching DeSilva at the beginning of the movie using an unsuspecting Miller as bait. <br /> <br /> What most hurt the film was ironically the last fifteen minutes when the story was from one shot in a sniper killer movie to a Rambo-like ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller fighting against a whole battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a London haze. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is still worth noting the fact of telling the story of a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war films: a solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or neurosurgeon performed and who does so in total secrecy.
