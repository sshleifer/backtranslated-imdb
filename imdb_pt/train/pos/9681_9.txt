Add Paulie the Parrot to beloved animal characters from movies. This movie is a love story - bird and Gena Rowlands, Bird and beloved Marie, Michael and Marie. A Russian janitor helps a parrot who speaks and thinks to find his rightful owner many years after Marie's parents sell him to a pawn shop. Before the end of heart warming, we learned all of Paulie's misadventures. Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are wonderful. Beautiful photography everywhere. Great little movie, word of mouth will make it a cult favorite.
