I saw this movie for the first time for over 25 years on British TV and only met it again last week in a DVD copy purchased on eBay. I remembered the musical sequences, the color and the beautiful clothes and fashionable clothes, but the plot is weaker than the previous Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding film, Spring in Park Lane, and Maytime does not stand out so well in the passage years. . But Michael Wilding is a joy in the movie, charming, funny, elegant, seems to be having a lot of fun and on top of his form. It's worth watching it yourself. Anna Neagle appears a bit matronly next to him, and a bit too old for the role she plays, but by the late 1940s her film partnership was well established with the movies going public. Spring on Park Lane was a hit of 1947 and a major money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote at length his great consideration for Herbert Wilcox, director and instigator of this London film series.
