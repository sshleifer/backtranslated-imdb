I saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out, (I can not remember exactly when). I thought it was okay for a Ben Stiller movie. This movie is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you need to think about them. Or like I said, you have a good sense of humor. From a couple of people on this site I saw that people had nothing good to say about it and did not get a very good rating but I would have given a higher This movie, I thought, was very good and should have gotten a rating best. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I'm just giving the opinion of someone else.
