Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar-nominated short film in 1944, consisting basically of 10 minutes of jazz improvisation in a long jam. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" at one point for the highlight of the movie, then jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring this most entertaining "jam session" to its exciting end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer and this experience is shown in some double exposure photos of some musicians, which makes it one of the most innovative angles of the 1940s. According to some notes, I read that one of the musicians was white and had than being filmed in silhouette, reflecting the social attitudes of the time. What a pity. Still, this most unusual movie of the time is available on YouTube, so if you like jazz, I suggest you look for it.
