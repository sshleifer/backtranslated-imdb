This is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. I love the feel of the backcountry of this movie. The film is very realistic and believable. This seems to happen in another era, perhaps in the late 1960s or early 1970s. Henry Thomas works well with the baby. Very moving story and worth a look.
