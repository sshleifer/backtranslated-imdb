This movie is such a cheesy thing. <br /> <br /> A group of people stuck in an abandoned school. They begin to be killed, they know they are being persecuted, so what do they do? One girl decides to take a shower, another decides to cheat her husband (who is also there) with an old boyfriend, so that they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) And go there. <br /> <br /> And it comes with blood and T & A. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the usual 1980s slasher is a reflection of how we see ourselves, or how adults view young people, or how Hollywood sees the rest of the country, it has a unique perspective. This is a Brit movie made to be an American slasher. It is hilarious to see how often British actors who are trying to speak "Americans" accidentally return to their British accents. <br /> <br /> If you like cheesy slashers from the 80's (like Pieces) then you'll like this.
