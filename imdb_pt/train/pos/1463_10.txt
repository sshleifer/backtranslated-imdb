Mardi Gras: Made in China provides a wonderful and intricate connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization through the creation and launching of beads. I saw this movie at the Boston International Film Festival, and I was expecting a dry introduction to globalization, but what I got was a visual display of shocking pictures of China and the United States. The eye-opening movie is humorous, deep, serious, non-paternalistic, and leaves you wanting more like the role of credits. Worth comparing with Murderball - it's simply done well. The young women workers in China have several points of view, and the owner is incredibly open about discipline. The revelers during Carnival are the highlight, but only because this excellent film provides a deep context within the factory in China without narration. Bravo to the filmmaker for entering and finishing the movie! I would never have thought about the connection between accounts, China and New Orleans; I now think of the human connection between almost all objects, but also the role of globalization, inequality, and amusement. More importantly, I can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this movie, unlike other movies about globalization that I've seen.
