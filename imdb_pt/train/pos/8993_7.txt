Rock n 'roll is a confusing business and DiG! demonstrates this masterfully. A project of serious ambition and, perhaps, recklessness, the filmmaker is able to repair together seven tumultuous years of accompaniment around two heavy rock groups. With that being said, the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. If you've ever been interested in some realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be an impressive sight. the song in the film, although it suffers minimally with cuts and collages required, is worth the price of admission alone. the morning after I saw DiG! I went straight to the record store to get a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (I was already started on the Dandy Warhols sounds). Defined primarily by his exploration of rock music, the film succeeds in other deep levels. Excavation! is a sincere and objective enough look at the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and for the people who try to challenge those forces.
