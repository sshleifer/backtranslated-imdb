I loved the episode, but it seems to me that there should have been some quick reference to the secretary being punished for actually being an accomplice after the fact. While I like it when an episode of Columbus has an unpredictable twist like this, its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode, along with the killer's discovery. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon, playing a famous writer, makes some comment about being flattered by the famous Lieutenant Colonel Columbo, making an ironic allusion to the real-life fame of the detective as a crime solver. This is one of the best of many large plots in Columbus.
