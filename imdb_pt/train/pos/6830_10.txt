Many comments here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail, so I will not do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the movie is a wonderful statement of life. At first, Myrtle Gordon is remembering how it was 'easy' to act when he was 17 when he was young and energetic and felt he knew the truth. The experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life is for, and indeed whether she can continue to live. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost invades. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. In the eleventh hour, she rediscovers the power of her art and reaffirms herself ("I'm going to bury that bastard," she says of actor Maurice as she steps onto the stage). It seems almost sadistic when the director of Myrtle prevents people from helping her when she arrives desperately drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to have the courage to do it alone, if at all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this triumph is only a temporary pause on Myrtle's downward path. I believe this is truly her 'opening night' - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. It is tremendously moving. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is superb. The film is excellent. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you may be.
