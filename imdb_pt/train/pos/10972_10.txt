I only saw this recently, but I was aware of this for several years and I was always intrigued by the title. Now it belongs to me as one of my favorite movies. It's hard to describe the incredible subject the Maysles have discovered, but everything works beautifully. There are so many memorable images and moments when you feel like you are invading a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and the characters in it. It's as if the filmmakers had cast a spell on the public and taken us to the strange world of eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wanting to be away from it all, cooking my cob on my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates everywhere. A fall of greatness from this once esteemed family. The money was gone, but its airs and graces remained, as well as its beauty. It drew me to the first picture and, long after the film ended, I found myself thinking about their fate. Supposing that if I took a walk along East Hampton Beach, I would still hear Old Edie's voice at night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick vine. Unforgettable.
