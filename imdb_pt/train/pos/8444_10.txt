After a rocky road of about 7 years on NBC, it was decided to make only one last Super Parcel. The series had been in the bubble several times, thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a blocker of an hour of TV. It has always had a considerable core of hard bodies of followers. It was almost as if the series with the full title of "HOMICIDE: LIFE IN THE STREET" (1993-99) was a sort of "Mr. In-Between" series. It was too big to be canceled, but too small to end a 'Rabid Ratings Ravings' case. <br /> <br /> During their precarious tenure on Friday nights, they performed some of the best and most daring Dramas Artistry Per Hour. There, I said this Artistic, Artistic !! But please remember that we refer to the Artistic, but not just to Preaching Faithful, Pretentious, Pedant, Politically Correct. <br /> <br /> When finally, it was a certainty that it was the end of the line for "HOMICIDE". ; This super episode was prepared as this 2 hours made for TV Movie. Watching all the happenings of past seasons and the parade of regular characters, the Production team came out and gave us what proved to be a great success. <br /> <br /> OUR HISTORY? ????? As we joined in the story, we discovered that the Baltimore Homicide Unit Command Officer, Lieutenant Al Giardello, "took the pin," who retired from work. But 'G' is not ready to actually retire and retire yet. So, instead of a rocking chair from a fishing rod, we find that Al is running for mayor of 'Charm City'. <br /> <br /> While in town, making some campaign stops and speeches, the former lieutenant detective carries a killer bullet. Alive, but in a coma, he is taken to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news spread quickly and as if officially summoned, we found all of the Baltimore Unit Detectives we saw on the show popping up to offer their services and assistance. There is a large gathering of all these current and present ex-gumshoes as they participate and follow every clue and possibility of leadership. <br /> <br /> The producer found a way to deal with those who had died before his memory in history. They have managed to answer some long standing questions and have even introduced some here to the undisclosed. The whole story ends the series in a more satisfying and original way. But, at least for now, we'll leave it as "confidential." <br /> <br /> By wrapping everything in a small, neat package, this TV movie certainly deserves our endorsement. As for the classification "THE HOMICIDE MOVIE", we must give an A or A +, even. But, no matter the grade here, it did not score as high as a typical weekly episode.
