Vanilla Sky is a remake of the 2001 film Abre Los Ojos (1997). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a self-centered egocentric who takes the emotions of other people as something guaranteed and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, the best of David, and in many ways just a friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bedmate. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers of all time. I'm not going to explain the plot anymore, because it's so much more attractive, unless you know. Ignore all the people who call this movie too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.
