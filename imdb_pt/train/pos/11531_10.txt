I remember when I was a kid when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's the reason I can still remember some parts of it). I do not remember acting much, scenes of nudity or other things, but I remember a male exploded with a grenade, a male dismembered on a tree and a male run over by a truck and shot in the head :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene where Jennifer McAllister ripped off the killer's stomach to get the keys to the truck. It's a movie that gives you the grace and it's worth taking a look. But where do I find this? How can I download it?
