In 2006, AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative documentaries portraying wildlife in the coldest place on Earth, the film was March of the Penguins, narrated by Oscar winner Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades. They have taken their stabs in live action movies and have been hit and lost all over the board. Disney then created a subdivision called Disneynature and released its first feature film titled Earth. This is absolutely one of the most exciting and informative documentaries I have ever seen. Narrated by the great James Earl Jones, Earth does not offer anything new to anyone who has watched the Discovery Channel for the past five years or has followed the global warming crisis closely. Earth touches the matter very deeply and takes a very liberal approach on the subject. <br /> <br /> It enables an emotional connection with nature that I had not experienced before. It also shows not only the beauty and the mystifying parts of our beautiful planet, but also the grunting and disturbing aspects that this often entails. It's one thing to watch "Mufasa" fall from a cliff into a stampede or Bambi's mother being shot by a hunter in the middle of the forest. Everything is good because at the end of the movie we know it's just a movie. This shows penguins, polar bears, elephants, all kinds of families, from all walks of life, living and dying in their natural habitats. These real things make a real movie experience. <br /> <br /> Although it's a bit heavy on the graphic nature of the movie (which many people will disagree with), Earth is a moving experience. There is an impressive cinematic work here by an excellent camera crew and an incredible George Fenton soundtrack. Compared with the March of the Penguins or the Grizzly Man, he does not really have any measurements, but he is excellent by itself. At the end of the day you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places that we will witness in the movie. We live here it's still like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another. The earth is beautiful. *** / ****
