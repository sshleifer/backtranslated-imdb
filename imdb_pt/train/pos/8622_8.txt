I just can not agree with the above comment - there are many interesting and really impressive images in this movie, it has an unusual structure and moves well towards a frightening climatic sequence that is remarkable for the effective use of silence. Moreover, he explores the unique impulse of suicide in a very frank way, not punching in what he shows, but not insisting and super-sensationalising the subject. has documentary evidence about him as well as horror and art cinema, and deserves a place among the canon of "different" horror films like The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (both of which it predates and could well be a influence not recognized in). It's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror movies.
