Rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of Grace Elliot, an Englishwoman who remained in France during the climax of the French Revolution. It was always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew that he was a reactionary of blood so red. If you can put aside Rohmer's shameless defense of the monarchy (and that's not an easy thing to do, since, for example, the French lower classes are portrayed here as hideous lunatics), this is actually an elegant film, smart and polished. . Without the money for a major cinematographic re-creation of eighteenth-century France, Rohmer instead, the actors play against painted cards. It's a blatantly artificial concept, but it somehow works. And the newcomer Lucy Russell manages to make a character nice that should not be.
