"The Case of the Scorpion's Tail" has all the elements necessary to make an effective giallo film. The story is giallo standard. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) charges a $ 1 million life insurance policy. The widow heads to Greece for payment, but a series of horrible murders follow her. There are many suspects, including a tenacious investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance agency and widow's mistress. Director Martino keeps the story at a brisk pace as the viewer tries to guess the killer's identity. Anita Strindberg (also memorable in "Your Addiction is a Closed Room and I Will Only Have the Key" and "Who Saw Dying?") Is an impressive heroine. It's one of Martino's best films.
