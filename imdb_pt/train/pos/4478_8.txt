Overall, this is a delightful, joyful, romantic musical comedy. I suppose a little case could be made for the movie to be over. But I'm not sure what you'd cut. The singing that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. The fabulous dance that Kelly does? No. How long does the film take to develop the plot and develop the characters' relationships? No (this seems to be a common complaint many times newer movies do not develop the characters). <br /> <br /> Some comment that Iturbi did not bring much to the film, but that gives us the chance to see and hear a great talent of the 1040s. So what if he was not an actor? He was an important part of the film, because the basic plot was to get Grayson to test him. <br /> <br /> Originally Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria. During her audition in the film, there is a photo of the MGM latina shaking her head and smiling. You can imagine it was like this when she did her real screen test years earlier. <br /> <br /> This movie is so full of life that it's hard to hit all the highlights. Great use was made of color and lighting throughout the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he made. A good counterpoint in the film is how Sinatra (a man of women at the time) played the role of just wanting to meet while on leave. You'll feel good after watching this movie. 7/10
