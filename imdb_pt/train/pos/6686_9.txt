This movie was a brilliant concept. It was original, cleverly written and great appeal to those of us who are not really pickers of "conformist" movies. Do not get me wrong - there are some great movies that have great appeal, but when you go to watch a movie based on "everyone is watching" - you know you are a teen or have no opinion. This had a subtle and lovely humor - though most people probably just look at the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and I thought there was a lot more "personal" personality in this film. It has appeal to children and adults. Esp. It's good to find a good movie that is not full of sexual references and drug insinuations! A great movie, not to be overlooked based on public consumption. This is a must buy.
