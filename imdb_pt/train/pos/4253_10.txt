Really great movie, one of the best I have ever seen. Touching and simple - just like life, sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and it's just beautiful. not much of anything, just as it is supposed to be. I really loved the idea of ​​the movie, no one is bad or good, all or just people, sometimes make mistakes mainly because of the pressure of the society, everybody tries to stay strong and some get more than others and the most important is that you do not I have reasons to be angry - you can do that, but eventually the anger goes away and then you need to let love come back, although it is difficult, there is true happiness. <br /> <br /> Great actors and cast, the film really makes you feel in the movie. <br /> <br /> well, cool. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching it, especially if you like to see the lives of the Italians. .
