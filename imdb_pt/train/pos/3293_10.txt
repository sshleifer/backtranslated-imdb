If you ever asked me to remember a song from a movie from years past, then it would have to be "Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo" for its meaning as it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the lyrics of Kaif Bhopali and not to mention film photography when the sailboat comes out against the black background and the bright stars. The other would have to be "Chalte Chalte". Pakeezah was Meena Kumari's last film before she died and the amount of time she took can be seen onscreen. In each of the songs that are portrayed, she looks young, but after that, she does not seem to. But an actor who has not changed in his appearance was the late Raj Kumar, who falls in love with her and especially by his feet, after he accidentally walks into his booth and when he sees them, he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are. Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that, if possible, should be seen on the big screen just because of photography and movie songs. The film stars Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi's grandson has now begun to relive his great father's studio by making a comedy movie.
