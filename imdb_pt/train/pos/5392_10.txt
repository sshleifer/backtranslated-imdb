The Wing of the Woman Waiting for a large hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where LIFE BEGINS. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a little novel, full of comedy and tragedy. , all linked to the life of the maternity team and their patients. The frankness with which the subject is treated points to the precoded status of the film. <br /> <br /> Marvelous Aline MacMahon, as the sympathetic chief nurse, is the quiet center of the movie, the rock around which flow all the chains. Able to cope with any crisis or emergency, she is the best friend of mothers, sometimes last. Surrounding MacMahon is a bunch of excellent colleagues: Loretta Young as a convicted murderer, released from prison long enough to give birth; Eric Linden as his astonished young husband; the tacky Glenda Farrell as a lady who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother in her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as caring and compassionate physicians and Frank McHugh as a frenetic comically frenetic father. <br /> <br /> Film experts will recognize Bobs Watson as a little uncle who wants to see Stork; Paul Fix as a nervous husband who promises to behave like a "little soldier"; Gilbert Roland as a disturbed Italian husband and Elizabeth Patterson as the wife of a snobby doctor interested in adopting Farrell's son - all without credit. <br /> <br /> There are some absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are obviously very old. ; Farrell gets pretty drunk on the ward, but none of the officials seem to notice; an obviously psychotic patient is able to walk around at ease - but this really only increases the movie's peculiar entertainment value and keeps things from getting too serious.
