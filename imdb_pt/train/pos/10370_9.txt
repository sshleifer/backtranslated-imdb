Some movies seem to be made before we're ready for them. While watching this movie, made in 1988, in 1999, I thought I was watching the O.J. The failure of Simpson (although I have very different opinions about the innocence of individuals in each situation). <br /> <br /> The Australian press, if this movie were to be believed, devoured the case of possible infanticide and truth. was left as a belated reflection. It was scary to see scenes of invasive and bustling media hordes, ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies, and debates about the supposed merits of the case by people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> Equally terrible is the representation of the media as indifferent and incomprehensible to the technical information of the case. I wanted more than the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the accused are seven-day Adventists). <br /> <br /> Today these circuses have become common, but this makes the lesson just more important. Streep is excellent as usual, and this is the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. The Aussie accents get a bit thick sometimes but not incomprehensible.
