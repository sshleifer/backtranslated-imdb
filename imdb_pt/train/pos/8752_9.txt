I've been waiting for an image as original as this for some time now. Brokedown Palace has this "hard to believe" aspect, however, with the ingenious direction, and script, the Palace wins a lot. <br /> <br /> I really never liked seeing Claire Danes in any of her movies, but I'll tell you what, she really changed her mind with this one. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes on vacation to Thailand, where they meet a young man who convinces them to take a trip to Hong Kong with him. However, he failed to inform that they would be carrying an obscene amount of narcotics for him. Well, in the end they get caught and end up in a prison in Thailand. I know, I know, how can you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can get through that little conversation, you'll find a very well written and staged story. Lately I've gotten into the story of the movies I watch and develop a personal feeling for the characters I watch. This movie is no different. At the end of the film, I found myself more concerned about her than any other character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, the Pullman delivers excellent performance and unites the film beautifully. <br /> <br /> There are some twists and turns that will bring you to tears by the end of the movie. This is one of those movies that you probably already passed while looking for that movie to watch at home. It's my opinion that next time in the video store, do not go through this again.
