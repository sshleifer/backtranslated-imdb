If you can not enjoy a girl movie, stop now. If, however, you like movies that illustrate complex characters and provide an extraordinary performance, keep reading. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord is dying. His two daughters come to his side. Ann begins talking about people from her past that daughters do not know about, and question whether these lost acquaintances are real or imagined. They realize that these people from their mother's past are, in fact, real. <br /> <br /> The story changes, basically, between 1953 and 2000, with some glimpses of Ann's life between those years. It was in 1953 that Ann met the love of her life and experienced the greatest tragedy of her life. <br /> <br /> One of Ann's two best friends in college, Lila, is getting married. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of a wealthy Newport family while Ann is a cabaret singer who lives in Greenwich Village and wants to be a free spirit but is still tied to many of the 1950 conventions. Soon after Ann arrives to be a maid of honor at Lila's wedding, she meets the person who will become the central character in the life of the three - Harris. He is the adult son of a former family servant who grew up with Lila and Buddy and went on to become a doctor in a small New England town. Ann immediately fell in love with Harris, which adds a complication to the fact that Lila has always been in love with Harris and continues to be. Buddy, too, is in love with Harris, but in 1953 he redirected Harris's homosexual desire to his good friend, Ann, because he can not admit to himself that he has a sexual desire for another man. Buddy displays his inner frustration outwardly for being the family's alcoholic and wise bad boy - to the chagrin of his very fit and tense parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all this is expressed and repressed. the emotions lead to tragedy - after all, this is a girl's movie. <br /> <br /> At the present time, Ann's daughters are distant from her mother and are suffering their own accomplishments and doubts. Constance is working for emotional exhaustion trying to keep her role as perfect mother and wife. Nina, having always felt inferior, can not maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Mix all these relationships over a period of fifty years, and you will get an intriguing insight into society, its values ​​and its effects on personalities. and actions of the complex people involved. <br /> <br /> All the acting in Evening is excellent, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this movie very, very special. . <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays Ann of the 50s, and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is in conflict with what she must do in opposition to what she wants to do. Its performance is not easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays dying Ann whose mind changes from the present to the past, for fancy flights, and of course, Redgrave takes everything with style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays Ann's daughter, Constance, in the movie. The scenes between this mother and the real-life daughter, playing fictitious mother and daughter, are an insightful treat to watch. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays Ann's other daughter, Nina. Nina spends a lot of her time depressed and feeling sorry for herself, while hiding a good man who loves her as much as her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a part like this, but I've never seen her giving a bad or unbelievable performance, no matter what part she plays. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer plays Lila from 1950 and shows us a woman even more conflicted about her role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays the current Lila. What there is to say about Meryl Streep besides her always gives an insightful and rewarding performance. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai claims in the extras of the DVD that he sought Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother. because he felt she was the only actress he could think of playing a scene in the movie. He was certainly right, and Close's performance in that scene impressed him in his mind. All other scenes in which Close is Lila's very good mother, and you have another performance to cherish. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the movie, combined with the Close show, described above, which makes every movie worth watching. On Lila's wedding day, Ann enters her bedroom and crawls into bed with her friend to discuss Lila's mistakes about her upcoming marriage to a man she clearly does not love. This scene is repeated fifty years later, when Lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived. In this last scene, Streep and Redgrave are captivating. <br /> <br /> The other memorable scene - at least for me - is when Buddy declares his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heart-breaking performance from a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. Your performance is superior. Girl movie? Yes. A very special film with unbelievable acting, direction and scenery? Definitely. I can not recommend it much at night.
