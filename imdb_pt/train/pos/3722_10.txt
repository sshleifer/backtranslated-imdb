First of all I saw this movie without knowing anything about it I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me. A friend and I went to see him at a Danish film festival called the nightly film festival which is a lot of different films shown after hours that the festival is quite specialized in viewing films that would otherwise not be shown in the Danish cinemas . <br /> Anyway, my friend and I went to see him and we were amazed at how real he looked and who really touched us with our feelings, we really got caught up in the plot without being able to find out by ending it's a great advantage in our book. <br /> <br /> The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative "dogma 95" that was started by 4 Danish directors, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In the Dark). In conclusion, the movie is really worth seeing, it gives a different perspective on how things were for the American GI Joe coming out of school is expected to serve his country in battle too far from home. Also Colin Farrell is exceptional in this movie that I have not seen him before, but I can not wait to see more of him. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
