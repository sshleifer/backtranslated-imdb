I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young. I did not know who the actors were, and did not know the movie would be any different than anticipated. I sure loved it. <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty stars as Detective Dick Tracy of the 1930s who fights the biggest mafia bosses in town. This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his girlfriend singer Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is keeping an eye on Tracy. It gets even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. He or she is very unknown. In addition, the famous villains are back from the comic book collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very colorful and creative. It was fun and fun to watch especially as a child. Warren Beaty was like the James Bond of the 1930s the way he played Dick Tracy. A cast of the film includes: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O - Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin and Charles Durning. Even more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. Believe me.
