This movie was pretty bad The last film of Vipul Shah was good This was just bad, although it is a good story and is treated in a great way Aatish Kapadia who adapted this film from another Gujarati piece "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" did a good, but slow pianful 2 and a half hours to watch there are many flaws in this movie but it is still an artist songs are a little discouraged and do not work well but they are still good in general not a movie you would watch enthusiastically is still a story to take into account and it is good if you are the kind of relationship very good movie with a lot of flaws and humor that really is not necessary at all
