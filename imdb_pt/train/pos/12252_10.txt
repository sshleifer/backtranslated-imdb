I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma". I've seen it many times and I'm always looking forward to seeing it again. Although it lasted only 107 minutes, most plots and sub-plots were developed satisfactorily. . All the characters are well portrayed. Most of the dialogue comes straight from the novel, no silly jokes like Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors. The scenery and the costumes were beautiful. I find this version very similar to the 1995 miniseries "Pride and Prejudice", but the producer and screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a great job portraying "Emma", of whom Jane Austen said she would create a heroine that no one would like. She's a snob, but she has enough youth and inexperience to still be nice. Mark Strong was also very good at playing Mr. Knightley, not an easy part, I think, although he did not have the charisma demonstrated by Mr. Darcy of Colin Firth in Pride and Prejudice. Even the final scene, which does not occur in the novel, provides an adequate ending, except when it shows that Emma is cold and almost unpleasant to Frank Churchill, while in the novel she was completely reconciled with him, even saying that she would have liked duplicity if she had been in her situation. A strange departure from the fidelity shown throughout the film. I find the costumes prettier and more elaborate than in other adaptations of Jane Austen's novels.
