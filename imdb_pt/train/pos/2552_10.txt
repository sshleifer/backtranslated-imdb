Fatal Error is a really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the movie. The cast of the film acted very well. Robert Wagner did his part well. The relationship between Saboto Jr. and Turner was good. There is perhaps a big age difference there but they are a unique couple. The two actors actually worked together quite well. The song in the film is very good by Ron Ramin and fits very well into the movie. There are a lot of things that happen in the movie that you do not know what's going on and what's going to happen next and this movie keeps you from start to finish. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr. and Janine Turner, watch this great movie!
