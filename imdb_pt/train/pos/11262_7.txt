The Devil's Game is my second production attempt by Joseph Sarno - and although I say it's so much nicer than the painfully tedious and non-erotic Swedish WILDCATS, it's still a bit slow and not explicit to my liking. <br /> <br /> This centers around a group of vampires who live in a castle, who want to resurrect their "leader" previously murdered. To do this, the girls have to dance naked and kiss and sing strange things - and of course, drink some blood as well. When a doctor and his brother's car break down and they have to stop at the castle to stay - they provide the ideal blood bank for horny vampires ... but they may not be as powerless as they seem ... The Devil's game is a great example of the farce of the early 70's. Lots of nudity - including some weak front tones, some dirty - including incest and of course lesbo-leech ... but these scenes still are very smooth by today's standards. Some very hot women, in this case, would have benefited from some more explicit sex, but I do not think you can have it all. It would also have benefited from some heavier violence / gore being a vampire movie, but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING was more to show skin, not blood. Still a bit slow - and the acting mostly is absolutely wood - but that is to be expected of something of this era and this budget. It's worth looking at exploring the fans - others may find it a little dull for your liking. 7/10
