"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I do not understand, because this movie has not received better reviews, it's funny, harmless and sweet. I watched it for the first time, when I was 11, and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later, I put it on VHS :-P Even today, I showed it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew the movie before. I think that's the problem, almost nobody knows it, so almost nobody can like it ... This movie never had a real chance, it's sad, "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like "Monsters Inc" or "Spaceballs" . Ok, rather displeased - What I really wanted to say is that if you want to laugh out of your head, watch! Even if you do not get mad at it, it's worth watching! -> Prepare to laugh, scum dirt!
