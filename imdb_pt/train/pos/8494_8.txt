I saw this movie again as a chore for my administration class. They were mainly commenting on the different styles of management and ideas about the quality (of the product). I rented this one in the eighties and I remember being good (but not great) movie. I always liked the style and delivery of Michael Keaton. It was a perfect fit for the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie. I agree that you're not an Oscar winner, but you have decent comic value. It's more of a subtle comedy than a total comedy farce. I also find some of those who felt that this was an inaccurate film about cultural and business differences. I beg to differ. I assure you again that there are many generalities and dramatizations, but again this is a Hollywood movie, not a documentary. From what I read about the differences between automakers on both sides of the Pacific at that time, many of the main ideas were accurate for the time. <br /> <br /> Some of the basic differences were that the Japanese workers felt at ease. as part of the company as a whole. Teamwork was emphasized. They maybe made the company above all else. Where American workers had more than one type of labor relationship. The individual was more important than the company. I'll probably get some hate mail about that comment, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Another difference was how quality was seen and whose responsibility it was to fix. In many Japanese plants, defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time they are discovered. Instead, as a character in the film put it "it was the dealers problem (which means car dealer)". <br /> <br /> Many of these things are probably dated, but I'm sure some are still out there. manufacturers are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese. If anyone is more interested in the subject of the American, European and Japanese automakers, I can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done in the same period of time. The book is called "The Machine That Changed the World" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. It is about a study of car manufacturers during and before the time period that this film covers. The parts are a bit dry, but I think you will find that you back up the movie as well.
