I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival where it received a standing ovation! This film tells a story that, as far as I know, has never been said before - namely, about the Rosenstrasse insurrection (a street in Berlin) of German Gentile women who were married to Jews at the end of World War II. As such, it is a unique story, and moreover, it is the only Holocaust film I have ever seen that shows that there were good Germans (the "Frank Frank" family, for example, Dutch), who did NOT support the Nazis, and indeed had the courage to face the country's own immorality and brutality during the Nazi regime at the risk of their own lives. The performance is great across the board, the story of interesting and intricate New York framing, the direction of Von Trotta masterfully in every scene, and the production values, including stunning, striking cinematography. Of course the family in New York may be speaking German. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native language with their family - a common occurrence. So this criticism is unwarranted. To say more would spoil the experience. The movie is long, but I did not look at my watch once. I hope this film has some distribution in North America, as this film is not just a masterpiece, but it can really help to cure any animosity that people have towards the Germans because of their support for Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, I urge you to see! You'll be glad you did!
