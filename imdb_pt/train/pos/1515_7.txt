Amicus did close to a good half-dozen horror anthologies in the '70s, and that, of the main terror scribe Robert Bloch, is one of his best efforts. There are four stories, all of which are worthwhile, but two - "Sweets for Sweet" and "Method for Murder" - are distinguished as highly effective travels to fear. In "Sweets," Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) resents her gross negligence and intolerance, so she sculpts a voodoo doll with which she expresses her aversion to their methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of mischievous evil and offers one of the greatest children's performances of a horror film since Martin Stephens in "The Innocents." This plot is directed with great subtlety and the final outrage, occurring off-screen, is a moment of pure horror. <br /> <br /> "Method of Murder" is about a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his own creations, the scary Dominic. This episode is impressive for its simplicity and absolute terror. Dominic may or may not be real, so director Peter Duffell has a lot of fun with our expectations. The brief shots of Dominic reflected on a lake or seen as a fleeting ghost in a pasture are truly astounding. The original poster art, with a skeletal figure holding a tray holding Peter Cushing's severed head, was a rich seduction for punters set in fear.
