brings to mind the writings of Stephen King and the terror-filled childhood memories of stories like TI - just like the opposite. There is no terror in these childhoods that any of the friends - who have been friends for 20 years - remember or seem to suffer. Above the line everything is described as a friendly push, perhaps periodically described as "catching" one or more of them, but all is forgiven. There is no angst embedded as the movie and the participants later describe the relationships - all we see are young people who have grown to be basically the same people. More mature, but basically still the same people, and the same structures of power. <br /> <br /> Totally incredible! Not just because people can actually grow relatively unscathed by social conventions - but also that friendships can actually last. In this respect, this film is a tiny Pearl - as it is supposed to have been the intent of the film: a portrait of untrammeled emotions uniting people. Which, when viewed as opposed to later years films portraying the obscure sides of childhood - the violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine is what easily comes to mind, but since the mid-1980s along with the growing worship of children and childhood Thousands of commercials, animations and series directed directly at children), several films and documentaries have succeeded in portraying the dark sides of growth - abuse, loneliness, effort to stand out - resulting in adults with dark and distorted minds. /> <br /> And here comes a movie, which says: It is possible to have a happy childhood, look there! <br /> <br /> Thank you for this. OR the illusion of balance ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
