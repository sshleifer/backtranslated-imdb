I took this film at IFC and enjoyed it, although I thought the editing work was a bit difficult, although it might have been deliberate. I had a little trouble figuring out what was going on at the beginning because they seemed to be going for a bit of a non-linear Pulp Fiction style presentation. It seemed a bit forced, though. I certainly think it's worth watching the movie, but I think I might have used a little cleaning. Some scenes simply do not seem to make sense after the others. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. Not great, but you do not have really serious problems. I gave it a 7/10. The movie showed at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants. They should have just told him that not in the Matrix movies.
