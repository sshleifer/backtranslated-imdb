This is a dramatic movie in every sense of the word. It says a tail that here in Greece we live as a routine in everyday life, without realizing how sad it is. Of course there are some extremes ... but every once in a while the sadness of real life goes beyond art. It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure built around them. The film has a deeper understanding of Greek ways of life, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek movies that have a certain fast-food audience, this does not target anyone in particular, but as you watch, you feel that someone puts in the best words and images possible to describe your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music, but I would not want to hear anything else when it was played during the movie. <br /> <br /> If someone told me to say something against this movie, I would define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or a little cut. I think the edition had to cut it to fit the 2 hours and a little to the theaters .. <br /> <br /> Anyway I could write more and more to express my thoughts on this, but I I think you have to see this and discuss it with a friend. Unmissable
