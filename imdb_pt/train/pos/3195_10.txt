BEAVER TRILOGY is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant films ever made. I was fortunate to watch it along with a question and answer session with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival a few years ago and then bought a copy of Trent's website. This movie has to be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend searching the name of Trent on the web and then buying the movie on their website. He's an incredibly cool guy. Do not be confused: The cameraman in the fictional sections of TRILOGIA DO BEAVER is NOT Trent! <br /> <br /> After having seen TRILOGY a few times, I have to admit that I could probably run out of Sean. Penn version. It's like a test version for the "Orkly Kid" section of Crispin Glover and it's more interesting as a curiosity item if you're a Penn fan than a good video. Penn is very funny, and you can see the result of a big star in this black and white video. <br /> <br /> This is probably also one of the best roles of Crispin Glover and I would love to see a documentary update on the original Groovin 'Gary. Once you see this movie, you will never take Gary's nervous laugh out of your head.
