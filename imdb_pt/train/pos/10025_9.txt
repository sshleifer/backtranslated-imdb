This has to be a unique twist of two genres already seen. The genre of giant monster movie with the genre of live mummy film. This unique blend contributes to a unique and compelling story. The casts are excellent, including TOM BOSLEY which, as far as I know, has never been in a horror movie before, ever. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy full of smaller mummies is cool. My only complaint, I just wish we saw more of the giant mummy, but others that I think they did a great job. The dialogue, the characters, and the story were perfect. The performance was wonderful. This has to be the best movie to get out of the science fiction channel. You heard me, the best movie that came out of the science fiction channel. I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 out of 10.
