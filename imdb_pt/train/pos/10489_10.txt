This lightweight comedy should be appreciated for entertainment value. It gets pretty hysterically funny at times, but if you did not spend some time on 'that' side of the tracks, you'll miss the comedy when it explodes. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters fuse together well and are quite believable in their roles. How Grace deals with her dead husband's girlfriend was well-played. She is a true lady. And, my favorite is Grace's white pimp suit she wears. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who applauds the oppressed or just wants to watch something different.
