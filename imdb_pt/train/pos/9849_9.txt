When I saw the trailers, I had to see the movie. And when I did, I kind of had a feeling that seemed unsatisfied. It was a great movie, do not get me wrong, but I think the big parties are already in the trailers, if you understand me. It was very fast and continued, so I was never bored and I enjoyed watching it. The mood was absolutely excellent. My first contact with a laziness (.. or something like that).
