When musicals were not show windows for choreographers, we had wonderful films like this. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was really happy to finally see this movie. Not quite a mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. A little bit of humor from the American vaudeville, the slapstick and not the witty joke, they clash with the British sense of humor of Wodehouse. But overall, American-style play makes American characters look real instead of cardboard cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some inventive scenarios for dance numbers, including the wonderful amusement park with spinning floors and mirrors for the lack of a Berby Busby about the top dance number. They seem a lot more realistic if you could imagine people starting to sing and dance like realists. <br /> <br /> The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore do not hurt the film, instead they allow different character dynamics. emerge. It is also good not to have a sage racist and stubborn interest. Instead, we have a gentle and stubborn love interest, much more according to the young aristocratic women of Wodehouses.
