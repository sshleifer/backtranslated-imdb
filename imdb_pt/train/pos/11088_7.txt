The villain in this movie is a nasty hiccup and he seems to like what he's doing, it's what I think makes him so mean. I do not think most men will like this movie, especially if they've already betrayed their wife. This is one of those movies that pretty much gets really bad to the end. But there you have it, a chocolate bar end that makes me look back and say, "HOKIE LIKE HELL". A good movie to the end. Finishing is the end we would like to see, but not the end of such a bad start. And then there is the result of what happened. I think you can decide on the true ending. I feel like only one character should have survived in the end.
