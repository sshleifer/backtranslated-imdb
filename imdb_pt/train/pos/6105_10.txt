All fans of Kira Reed should see this. The premise of the novel has the novelist Kira unable to present new ideas. She's also getting a divorce. However, she knows this guy in a restaurant and he helps her get out of her shell (and clothes). They go into a corner room and do it. Fortunately, Kira takes a condom (Now, never tell me that these Playboy movies are useless piles of down. Remember children, safe sex). Later, she marvels at her publicist how great it was, but she did not get his name. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. But eventually she gets tired of her weirdness and wants to know more. When it does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the best of these soft-core Playboys movies that I've seen. Check this out and marvel at Kira's greatness.
