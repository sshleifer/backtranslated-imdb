If you have read the books, forget the characters that Tolkien created in your head. The representation of hobbits, dwarves, etc. had the treatment 'disney'. The dark riders are excellent, and as I always imagined in the books. <br /> <br /> Cynically, this is an excellent movie that mixes live motion and animation to produce incredible effects for the year. I just wish he (Bakshi) got the money to complete his epic. <br /> <br /> It is worth having the video, since they will be worth a little after the Lord of the Rings 2001 !!
