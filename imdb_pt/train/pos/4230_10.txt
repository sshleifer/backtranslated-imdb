For Columbus fans, like me, this is the episode episode that explains why Columbus was so popular and how good he really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as always) playing the incredibly clever crime novelist Abigail Mitchell. It seems that Abigail calls her nephew to sign some papers making him his heir. She never overcame her niece's death and is convinced that her dead niece's husband (Charles Frank) did the dirty act. Telling more would be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley plays a malicious role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbus is in a class by itself. It's a really well done television movie. I recommend this very well.
