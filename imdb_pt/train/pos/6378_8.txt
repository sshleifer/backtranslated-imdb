Atlantis: The Lost Empire has some of the best and smoothest animations and cleverly written dialogues of any Disney movie I've ever seen. And I was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes. I particularly love the voice work of Don Novello on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Too bad the whole movie seems to move at about twice the pace that would be appropriate - at least in the first act. An important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which Atlantis does not offer. It is better on average. In the middle of the movie, there is a mediocre twist. That is all. It's a great movie, though. Everyone should see this.
