This is a pretty boring movie. Well filmed with realistic performances, especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic climates and connotations of art everywhere, he fails because the director does not take position, position or critical comments on the topic he stipulates. One of France's revered and regular work partners in films with Depardieu - I believe they did 7 together - Pialat can not get involved. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall in love with the bad boy who will get hurt when they have a considerate boyfriend and a good-hearted husband around. Isabelle Hupert, who interprets the flirt with a disinterested distinction, offers answers of opprobrium as "I do not know"; "I like his arms"; "I like the way he makes love" to the inquiring husband who tries to get her out of the house, but pays and reconsiders because ... I suppose he loves her. So he accepts and waits for what? That she will one day wake up and go back to her senses. Things like this are not answered in the condescending docu-drama style of Pialat with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not add up. I know the answers do not add up, but please take a stand. Jules and Jim, this is not it. The last shot as cold as the movie we just watched is a heartache and headache just for the most tolerant.
