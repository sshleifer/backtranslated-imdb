"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film from the Ted Turner library; Disney was remade in 1994, this time using the Angels of California (now the Los Angeles Angels) as the team (Disney used to have this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team; also, good use of the words, huh ?????). <br /> <br /> This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. A man promised the boys a family, only if the angels won the pennant. So he called God one night about it. The boy who prayed could see the help coming in the way (and ONLY that boy); for example, when the first angel came down, a player hit a ball so hard that not only broke the club, as did the ball !!!!! For much of the post-All Star season of 1994, the Angels were at the top of AL West (of which my home team, Rangers, is one and still is). However, they lost a game because the boy was on the court instead of the White Sox / Angels (there was no Central Division in Baseball at that time, so Chicago was in the West), and no angel was there to help. Thus, a new rule was created: no angel can help in the games of the championship. But wait! In the last game of the championship, the angels won !!!!! It was really a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: This is a good movie. I mean, I've prayed every night for the past few years asking for help at school and things like that; look at me now! My work was good !!!!! So on the one hand, this shows that if you believe, God can send his angels to help you with any problems you may have in life. And second, this is a family baseball movie, which is always exciting. This is an old Disney movie too; I saw this recently on the New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Angels in Outfield" will change your life forever, once you've seen it !!!! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
