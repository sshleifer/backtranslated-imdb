"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit comedy that has its laughs and "huh?". But I suggest giving it a try. I think it's much more sought after. Not many people give this movie a chance. It works. Just think of it as a little parody of "Goodfellas." Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He only works from the great bosses to a beautiful wife. And of course, like many Mafia movies, somebody wants him killed. 90% of the jokes laugh. Like, I said, give it a chance. Just have your favortie gangster movies and mix a comedy in. You have "Johnny Dangerously". <br /> <br /> 7/10
