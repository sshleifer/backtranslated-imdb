The movie was good, very funny. The cast was very good, and I go according to what the comment before me mentioned - Glenn Quinn was excellent and only he is reason enough to watch this movie. He brilliantly played the selfish "evil" friend and manager of the band! <br /> <br /> There are many songs interpreted by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie, but this is not a surprise considering the film is a production of VH1. However, if rock / pop music is not to the liking of someone, you can show these scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot of a band trying to get to the top in Los Angeles, but having to overcome many obstacles along the way are not very original but very fun with some surprising scenarios here and there.
