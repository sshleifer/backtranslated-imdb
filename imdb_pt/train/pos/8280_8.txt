George and Kim are traveling with their son Miles to a remote cabin in New York when his car crashes into a deer and turns into a ditch. But what appears to be a mere occurrence of unhappiness marks the beginning of a terrifying journey, where myth becomes reality and a carnivorous spirit, half animal and half man Wendigo, haunts a small town ... "Wendigo" by Larry Fessenden, is an intriguing horror film that often turns into a bleak family drama. The acting is great, the characters are well developed and there are some bone-chilling moments. The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are treated effectively and it is never clear what is real and what is imagined, or even if the story is occurring entirely in Miles's head. "Wendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and it certainly will not be the last. Give this movie a chance if you do not mind watching something unconventional. 8 out of 10.
