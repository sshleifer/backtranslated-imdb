This movie pleasantly surprised me. It has a touching, slightly decentralized approach that never loses its attention. This is a movie I've never heard of, but if you want a sleeper, that's it. Great writing, production and acting. I strongly recommend to the audience that they want something thoughtful. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why was not it made out of this movie?
