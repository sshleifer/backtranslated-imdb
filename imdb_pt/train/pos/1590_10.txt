I started watching the TV series "What I like about you" and I must say it's a joy to watch. I always like to see new shows do well, considering that many shows happen before you actually realize them. I've watched Amanda Bynes since "All That" she's really a funny girl, the best thing about her comedy is that it's so natural and what I want to say about it is that it's something a person could have here not rehearsed. <br /> <br /> I just recently started to watch the show and fell in love. I'm just watching re-runs from now on, but I'm looking forward to next season. All the characters on the show give something to the whole story. It's nice to see some old faces from other shows I've enjoyed watching in the past, such as Jennie Garth from "90210", Leslie Grossman from "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan from "City Guys". The new character is also very talented, Nick Zano has that charm that makes you love him even when he's doing something wrong with Holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Overall, this program has the right ingredients to be successful. I look forward to seeing it grow.
