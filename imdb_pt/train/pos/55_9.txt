At first I was not sure if I wanted to watch this movie when it appeared in my guide, so I looked at IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so I thought I'd try a movie like Elephant. <br /> <br /> After I went through the fact that I should not like the character Alicia, touched excellently by Busy Phillips, I realized what a good job this movie was doing to establish the relationship between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia is so mean to Deanna played by Erika Christensen for most of the film, but we find out that despite being polar opposites, they have one thing in common besides being present in the shooting. They share solitude and to what extent it is revealed as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> I just said how much I loved this movie and was happy to see all the positive comments about it. I could not even get past Elef√© because it seemed to be just exploring Columbine's tragedy. This film, on the other hand, was compelling and realistic. Busy Phillips is out of the chain !!! That is a good thing and I would love to see your progress in more mature roles.
