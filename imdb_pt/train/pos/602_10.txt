I've never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel that this movie was perfect. The colors, as the dances were screaming, the gypsies and the rivals together created a movie that seemed to have run out too soon. I've seen other movies by Carlos Saura and I agree that this movie may be your best production. I feel that the best features of his previous films have been put together and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity happening behind the cameras. While watching this movie, I felt myself sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, watching the dancers comfortably tapping on a wooden board over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fits like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this movie in the US for years to come. I recommend this movie to anyone who is drawn to the livelihood of other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is certainly on my list of favorites.
