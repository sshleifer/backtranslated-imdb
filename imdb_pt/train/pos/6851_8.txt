De Palma's technique reached its high maturity at the time of this film, which is a marvelous display of his classical techniques, although, unfortunately, as in many of the films written by De Palma, the story serves the goal more than the interests of presenting an emotionally convincing tale. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in the bath while looking at her husband. She is then seized and raped while her husband is forgotten nearby - and the whole thing is revealed to be Angie's fantasy while her husband is pumping without thinking to her in bed. She has a short scene with her son, a dead bell for Harry Potter, which concludes with a joke that "she'll tell Grandma that he's playing with his peter." She then goes to the therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Then begins a sequence of 22 minutes almost speechless that may be the highlight of the movie. Among the many things that De Palma has gathered from Hitchcock is the understanding of the film as a purely visual means of storytelling? and in De Palma's typical fashion, he turns it into a way to show off his formidable ability. The problem, for me, is that in this case you begin to feel that the scenes are being delayed unnecessarily simply to further show the director's skill. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie in an art museum. She observes strangers, all engaging in sexual or family activities, and then begins to bond with a man sitting next to her. De Palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word on the attraction of Angie, embarrassment, retreating and finally find and send to the stranger in the back of a cab, all set for a wonderfully lush score by Pino Donaggio, who also marked Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence, Angie slept with the guy and got up to go back to her husband. Again De Palma tosses a ton of narrative without a word of spoken dialogue, as Angie realizes that she has no panties, that her husband is already at home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she probably contracted a venereal disease. , and that she lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. It's all very admirable, but we're starting to get a little nervous as we're forced to do things like get off a seventh-floor elevator and climb up again, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers from now on! When Angie arrives on the seventh floor again, she is killed by a large woman with blond hair. The woman cuts her to the ground floor when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. There is a wonderful slow-motion sequence as Nancy arrives at the elevator, Angie approaches her, and the assassin's blade is safe to cut off Nancy's hands. Then follow some electrifying shots when Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the convex mirror of the elevators. It's okay, and when we have some more dialogue, you think; "Woah, this was just 22 minutes straight from purely visual narrative!" Or maybe not you, but I know. <br /> <br /> A young Dennis Franz has a great role as a tough New York detective who prefers everyone to do his job for him. He interviews Michael Caine, making the outrageous implication (though it happens as a commonplace) that Angie WANTED to be killed. Angie's son is also there, and he meets Nancy, and they begin to spy on Caine's therapist and find out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Once again there is a strong bond with a Hitchcock movie. , in this case Psycho (as Obsession is a rework of Vertigo). You have a woman who we must understand who is secretly a whore, who is dead in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator, rather than a shower. Then the relatives of the deceased carry out an investigation, which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. De Palma even plays a doctor at the end explaining the psychology of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can start to feel a little annoyed, and that's my main reservation about this movie. It is definitely essential to see and show some of De Palma's greatest works, but the feeling that the story is in a solid third behind the need for De Palma to show off and his somewhat improper sexual fantasies make it difficult to look at her with affection of the whole heart. <br /> <br /> Check out other comments on my site for bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
