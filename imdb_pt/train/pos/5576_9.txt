This movie is hilarious! I watched with my friend and just had to see it again. This movie is not for you movie goers who will watch only Oscar-nominated films (you know who you are). I will not recapitulate because you've seen this from all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Whipped" is a light comedy that made me laugh all over. Do not take yourself too seriously and should be watched with your friends, not with your girlfriend. It will not win any awards, but only need to be observed to be appreciated. It's true that some of the jokes are toilet humor, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use it sometimes, sometimes. Some people need to be enlightened and see "Whipped" for what it is, not what it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 out of position.
