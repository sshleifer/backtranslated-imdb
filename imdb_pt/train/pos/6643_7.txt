When I learned that this movie was coming out the night before Halloween, I was very excited. When I discovered it was a book, written in 1978, I had to read it before seeing the movie. I'm sure the film would have been very different for me if I had not read the book. The writers really did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book, with little differences, of course. I think the thing that most disappointed me in the movie was Boyle playing the role of Col. I'm not a big fan of Boyle, and it seems like no matter the mood during the movie, she's always trying to use it Lips dilated and eyes make-up to become super sexy. In fact, I think the film stayed true to the real shiver of the house. My favorite subplot was the Sheehan family (which is so weird because the son was killed in Iraq and, in the current events, there is Casey Sheehan whose mother participated in a major speech against Iraq). In the book, obviously, the war was not Iraq, but Vietnam, and when the house connects that video of her son on the helicopter, I was really scared. Overall, I was impressed by the film as it accompanied the book very well.
