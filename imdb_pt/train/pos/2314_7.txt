I had heard good things about this movie and, you guessed it, was a bit disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really the whole cast (small) is quite solid in its simple American environment of the 50's. The reason I did not evaluate this film is mainly that in the end, the sadness shown by the big sister did not seem so real and it took me away a little bit of the movie. Maybe we should fill the plot, or maybe the movie needs to be a little longer. Maureen's character is quite undeveloped, I think. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., younger) was traumatized and angry, but why is her sister more upset? Why is she a few years older? Was not the ending harmed by the rest of the film? The rhythm of the movie makes it look like Maureen and Court have just met each other when he's been treated (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal, in retrospect, it looks like she was trying to bump a little. It depends on what you want - if you want the happy story of young love that looks like you will have, you will have a surprise. Man in the Moon is both weird and dreamy and an old maturing film? a rather strange combination? I liked the character of Court, I can see what girls watching this may be watching. And I loved that they had the guts to let him hurt his younger sister (most men would, most movies would not) and get killed. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my rather severe scale. For some reason, I found Jason London on a funny tractor.
