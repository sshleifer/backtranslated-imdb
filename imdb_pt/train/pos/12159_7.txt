After her children are sentenced to life in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) begin receiving threatening phone calls because someone feels their children are easily dismissed. The pair decide to move to California to escape the publicity of the trial and start a new life. They start a dance school that is soon very successful. One of the students has a wealthy single parent whom Adelle quickly falls in love with. Meanwhile, Helen is busy raising rabbits and falling in love with an evangelist on the radio. It's only a matter of time before it all comes undone and women enter a world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can not help but compare What's the matter with Helen? for whom he killed Aunt Roo?, also starring Shelly Winters. Where this movie seemed almost contained in its presentation of Aunt Roo's madness, there is nothing holding Helen back in this movie. It may take a good portion of the film's running time, but once it grabs, Helen is a Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to mess with her. Winters is so deliciously demented that it was impossible for me not to take advantage of his performance. I'm not going to ruin the movie, but the things Helen is capable of are totally exaggerated. <br /> <br /> - As good as Winters is, Reynolds is totally ridiculous in his role as gold. - Saying tapper. I got the impression she thought she was in a movie that would get her nominated for some prize. This is not Citizen Kane! Stop acting so serious. Hey, Debbie, do not you realize that your main goal is to be a victim of Winters insanity? <br /> <br /> - I just love those ex-women-stars-in-the-twilight. horror movies of his career. What's the matter with Helen? is as fun as any other.
