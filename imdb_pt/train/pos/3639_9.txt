This movie, to me, is about family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream not only for himself but for his family. I can not begin to tell you how I would be able to tell my little girl that Dad was going to Kansas City to cover Father Holmes and the Kansas City bosses. She thought it was the nicest thing, like Morris's son. Living dreams with family is what this is about. I think only a parent who has a close relationship with his family can really appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
