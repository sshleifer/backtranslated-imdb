I have read some of the comments from other users and decided to put one too. Some of the users are stuck in a kind of "realistic" mindset. This movie was made to be a 'fancy' movie .... a 'and if' fun. It was never meant to be "real" or serious. It was very enjoyable to everyone I knew when it came out - despite having shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion ... I was 30 years old at the time and totally enjoyed this - my beloved son too! Later I shared it with my daughter and she also loved it. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should be enjoyed just for that - fun. All the "realists" of the world should cheer up or watch documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. I'm sorry for those young people who watched this movie first and then they could go to the actual SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at the Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have been hoping to find the same kind of environment that was pictured in the film and then felt " deception "... I think his parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you like fancy movies and did not see this, I highly recommend! Appreciate!
