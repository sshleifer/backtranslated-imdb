The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia visits her father for the birthday of her father, who occasionally always has some kind of tragedy, the question is exactly what it will be this year, and you will be surprised ... It is an extremely well composed film, with a story that has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness that is rarely seen. You get happy, you get hurt and basically everything in between. Finally you can not help but fall in love with Mia (if you're a kid, I think (the lead actress)) She's an extremely well-chosen actress, like many other actors. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
