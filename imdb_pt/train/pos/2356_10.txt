Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Much like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you might say it was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how people who do not like theater, movies, music, and the like would be bored. This is not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some. These people seem to need a slightly more linear and gentle tone to keep them happy. This program explodes with color, blinks in old movie scenes, hums with incredible music and talented performances. There is nothing random about the choices that are made from fantasy to leitmotif. The story has many twists, but all very accessible, because the talks are about love, honesty, courage, loss and so many other things that we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the end of the show and we were rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not approach this like a typical TV show. Think of it as a night out in the theater, then sit back and enjoy yourself!
