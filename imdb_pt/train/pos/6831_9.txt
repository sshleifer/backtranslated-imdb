I only know of another movie that could compete with Opening Night and that's Bergman's Person. Both films are simply amazing, they have a wealth of ideas difficult to understand at first glance. We have a deep meditation on the relationship between art and life as an actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), is more in touch with the character she's playing onstage than she'd like. The accidental death of one of her fans, a young woman who declares her love for Myrtle and she is then run over by a car, leaves a deep mark on the actress. She begins to ask herself a question related to her aging that begins to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness. The scene in which she kills the dead girl's (or not) imaginary spirit is one of the most thrilling scenes I've encountered in a Cassavets movie. The film ends with a show of genius on behalf of the director by filming a theatrical scene in which he and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene, since Myrtle gets too drunk for the night of debut to execute his part with precision. This scene was filmed spontaneously, with a live audience, the laughter is genuine, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely incredible. If you liked Persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment, this movie will be perfect for you.
