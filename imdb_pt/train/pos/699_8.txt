I saw Insomniac's Nightmare not so long ago for the first time and I have to say, I really found it very good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan you will love it. The movie hole takes place inside your mind, or does it? The acting of all the others is a little rushed and unstable and some of the scenes can be cut, but in the end. The extras on the DVD are as good as the movie, if not bigger for Dom fans. It has tons of heartfelt set moments, outtakes and a great interview with the director. Anyone who has gone through an independent movie will love watching Tess (the director), Dom and everyone else in the small personal group, try to release this scary little movie. It was very nice and I'm happy to have it in my collection.
