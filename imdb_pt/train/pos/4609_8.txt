Probably the best Jackie Chan movie in the 1980s and what put it on the map. The scale of this self-directed police drama is evident in the opening and closing scenes, during which a village and a squatter mall are demolished. There are clearly differences between the original Chinese and the dubbed English versions, with many of the jokes failing to enter the second. The latter is also harmed by stars that do not look like their Chinese originals. In fact, the only thing the dubbing corrected was the trial in court - at the time, the trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original has this scene in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> Fight style and martial arts choreography inject humor whenever possible, so non-Cantonese audiences do not miss much. It is not, after all, the dialogue that makes a film of Chan, but the action and the painful results. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an incorruptible detective from Hong Kong, chasing after a gang godfather (Cho Yeun), and is assigned to protect a star-witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is great from start to finish, and there is not much time to breathe in the middle. This will never make you think, but what a fun and well intertwined movie. Arguably, this is one of the best martial arts movies out there.
