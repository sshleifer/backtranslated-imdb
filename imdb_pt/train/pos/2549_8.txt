The wonderfully urban Ronald Coleman is featured here as in a few of his other films. He's literally in every scene and this comic movie stays cool because of him, not despite him. He is handsome, witty and very clever here while staying one step ahead of his lovely wandering wife - played perfectly by Anna Lee. The film is based on a French play and brings all the best qualities of this farce. Most of the support cast is well known, at least for the face, if not the name ... and it is absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, while he stays one step ahead of the other characters. Their multi-talents can be even more appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon" that every movie fan should see.
