Why the previews are so cool for a movie that is so awesome !! Everyone should know what a great movie this is. It's engaging and fun from the first moment, original and well-represented. I wish the movie was doing as well as it deserves! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth and other truly funny and original fantasy adventures, this is one of the best. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leader man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is impressed by her recent returns to the screen. There are also many wonderful moments of secondary characters ... even in facial expressions.
