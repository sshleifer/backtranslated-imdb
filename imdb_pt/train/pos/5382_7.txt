After watching the series of reality shows Next Action Star, I was happy to see the film of the winners immediately. I was suspicious of such a showcase of new talent, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Billy Zane, of course, was his usual big self, but Corinne and Sean stood beside him. It was also good to see Jared and Jeanne (also from the competition) in their special roles. Sean's character, not Billy's, is the hunted, and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well-played. Corinne walks right on the tightrope between her character liking Sean and just being in it for the money. I loved how the game was played until the last second. And then beyond! Not a great movie but a fun all the way and a great showcase for two people on their first time out of the gate.
