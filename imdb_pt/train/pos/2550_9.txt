This is truly one of Hollywood's "Golden Age," the kind they do not anymore. It's a fun and unique movie that makes you guess what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfect and they are all great supporting actors. This is the first movie I've seen with Ronald Colman and I've been a fan of him ever since. Reginald Gardiner has always been my favorite supporting actor and adds a certain quality to every movie he's in. Although he played a different kind of character here, he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in that character would not have added.
