This is a good example of a movie that, despite the low rating, is worth watching. The story is engaging and it does not take long for the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin to catch their attention. The acting is first class and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it seems that the director could not decide between drama and romantic comedy. The picture of Ben Chiller on the law respecting and shy English with Porn S.M. magazines hidden in the bedroom create many moments of laughter! So does Nicole Kidman's gaze when she's giving John her first taste of intimacy in a long time ... Other times the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy a dramatic approach.
