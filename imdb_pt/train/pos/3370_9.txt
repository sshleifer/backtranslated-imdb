Having just finished Cronicles of the Heroic Knight a few minutes ago, I find myself extremely pleased, but the issues still hang over me. Although it seems that the first 7 episodes or more are actually a rereading of the events of the first Record of Lodoss War, the truth is that they really are not. It seems that the creator of CotHK had a different view of how the original ended (and this may be the reason the first 7 episodes occur), but I do not think that's the case. CotHK says that it begins five years after the War of Heros, of which Parn was part. I think the director made the first 5 episodes look like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a little reminder and an introduction to the characters and their deeds because they appear much less after the series enters the Spark story. Now, since the series kicks Spark's part, we find ourselves another 10 years (15 years since the War of Heros). Spark and his team in some cases look like Parn and his team when the journey begins, especially the love story that shines between Spark and Neese. I also thought several times about CotHK that I played in the original series and if it was not for Spark's long blue hair I know I would have pressed to stop more than once to make sure the right disc was inside. Consider these great setbacks, however, the writers have done a good job at crafting believable characters and a remarkable plot. The only thing that hurts me is that Ashram and Wagnard return. Hmmm ... how ??? Do not get me wrong, both are great villains, though the only vile trait of Ashram is that he supports the Marmo. Maybe I missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part. With regard to sequels, I recommend CotHK. I put both CotHK and, even more so, the original Lodoss War Record well above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both are more epic than anything I've ever seen or read. I recommend it.
