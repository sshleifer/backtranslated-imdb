Okay, so I've come a long way from Houston, but every time I see this movie, I'm taken back to the dream of a cowgirl to one day ride on Gilley's bull. He burned before I'd drunk. <br /> <br /> If you grew up in East Texas then you know that this movie is an accurate depiction of contemporary life back then. If you did not trust me and watch the movie. Or you will join many who love you (and at the same time strangely repelled), or at the very least, you can make fun of red necks. There 's too much material to ridicule. This movie does not try to be p. (what was that in the 80s) or hide the white trash element and is honest with time and place. <br /> <br /> It has to be a 10 for me!
