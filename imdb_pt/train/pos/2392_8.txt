I have a baby of 19 months and I was really tired of watching Care Bears all the time. Rooney is a great dancer, who cares if he's gay. This guy must have been a cheerleader or something. <br /> <br /> Beats Barney, I can not get the songs out of my head .... should ... stop singing ........ Scribbling songs. ....... NOW. <br /> <br /> Must have 10 lines of text so I should continue ..... what to say when we say all Canadian things like the OOOUT Aboooot. Canadian naughty ..... Jazmine is rhyming too much, she must be Dutch. <br /> <br /> Knock knock, who's there, Dee Dee, super hottie <br /> <br /> Bus driver Bob does not know how to dance? take lessons from Rooney
