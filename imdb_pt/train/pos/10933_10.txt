Be careful with this one. Once you get your gloves on, it will change the way you look at kung-fu movies. You will be longing for a plot of all kung-fu movies now, you will be wanting depth of character and development, you will be longing for mystery and unpredictability, you will require dynamic camera work and incredible background cloths. Unfortunately, you will not find all these aspects together in a kung-fu movie, EXCEPT for five deadly poisons! Easily the best kung-fu movie of all time, Venom combines a rich plot full of twists and turns with colorful (and developed) characters along with some of the best camera work that has come to us. The success of someone who likes the film depends on the ability of the viewer to decipher which character is which, and who specializes in which venom. One is the centipede, two are the snake, three are the scorpion, four are the lizard and five are the frog. Each character has different characteristics, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. Here lies the hook, we learn along with the student character, discovering who these different men are. We are in his place (so to speak), and we have to choose who we trust and whom we do not trust, just like him. We learn along with him. The plot, the characters and the camera work are great to watch, which in my book makes it more valuable than any other film of its kind. It pays some watches to understand everything that is going on. Venoms is a lesson in what kung-fu can really do ... just do not expect too many other kung-fu movies to live up to it.
