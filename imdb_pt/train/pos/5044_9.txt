Bill Paxton stars and directs this highly original movie. Having watched the first time I was with how good it was. The comments I had heard were OK. As a result, I was expecting an average thriller at most. However, because of the excellent direction Paxtons and acting the movie is worth watching, especially if you are a horror movie fanatic. The film is also helped by the twists and turns that keep coming up to the final credits. The strongest point of the film is the storyline that I have to say is highly original and it's like I've seen it before. Well done also for the two youngsters leads perfectly convey the emotions if these boys confused. I give this movie 9/10 and I recommend everyone to capture it.
