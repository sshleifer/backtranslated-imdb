This is an old-fashioned and wonderfully fun children's film, certainly the most attractive new witch of all. Unlike many modern stories that seem to amuse themselves with dark witchcraft, this is simply a magical hocus pocus tale that is cute, light and charming. <br /> <br /> The tale is set in 1940 in the English village. of Peppering Eye, where three cockney kids, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins, are being evacuated out of World War II air strikes. They are sent erroneously to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence to become a witch apprentice. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic knob to travel to London in their flying bed. Here they meet Emilius Browne, the fraudulent director of the Miss Price Witchcraft Training Correspondence School. Miss Price talks about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. Meanwhile, they also need to deal with an obscure character named Bookman and his associate, Swinburne. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is obviously wonderfully charming as the eccentric witch in training, Miss. Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, director of the now-defunct school of witchcraft, who has now become a street magician. This actor was previously cast as the father of the children in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a tale rather reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. Maybe this movie does not have a memorable song like Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it has some nice little melodies. Some were critical, but the film features excellent special effects. All in all, the story is charming family entertainment. It is a shame that modern children are too sophisticated for this charming and seductive tale that should please the child in all of us.
