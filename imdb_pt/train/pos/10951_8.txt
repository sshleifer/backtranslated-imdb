Big S is not playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like, say, Mencia or Chapelle (although I like both). It states the obvious in subtle, almost subliminal observations. Your show is not going to change the world, nor is it for. But along with hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of Mr. Show, this is a middle-of-the-mill show with an appetite for destruction! My side was completely destroyed by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and I like her famous boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she only delivers the lines and lets the viewer run with her. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and anyone, like "Mary Poppins" in the second episode, when she sings to the fake birds to rap fast comment on society and old college existential absurd. This is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and have not lost it on their latest lip treatment or breast work).
