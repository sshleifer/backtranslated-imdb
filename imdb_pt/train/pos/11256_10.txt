Undoubtedly the best of John Le Carre's novels, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus Czech intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus man's father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus mentor , British believer and controller), along with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for casting them should have been awarded. Even the small parts, like Major Membury, are executed to perfection. It says a lot about the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite Magnus's duplicity, one can not help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of US Intelligence. . I've read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost so many times, and I'm still hypnotized by both. If I had a book to take on a deserted island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others.
