After reading some pretty negative reviews for this movie, I was not sure if I should shell out some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I did not see the original movie, but if it was better than that, I would be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than a smile on his legs (for the third time in his career, the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is a bit lightweight but fills the demands for her role as well as Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the film, however, it's not the performance that really impresses - it's the movie. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe excels in the role of director, giving himself a welcome change of pace over his usual chatter. The growing insanity of the film is perfectly executed by Crowe (the brief sequence in which Cruise walks through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinctive feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as a spectator. The plot seems a bit artificial, but the issues explored behind it are infinitely debatable. The film is not perfect, but it's a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on a Hollywood diet, it should be a revelation.
