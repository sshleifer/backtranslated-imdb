Version: Release of Universal / Legends of Hong Kong R4 DVD. Once, five years ago, the world was obsessed with 'The Matrix', and I was perhaps one of the few fifteen-year-olds who still believed that 'Terminator' was better than 'The Matrix'. I was just a plain teenager, looking for a good action movie, and then there was a bright light on a TV station I had never really watched, a small station known as SBS. One night, I noticed in the TV guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan - "Police Story" would be published later. When I was fifteen, and having seen only 'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'Rush Hour', I said ... "WOW AWESOME" and sat down to watch, and continually shouted "WOW AWESOME" as the movie progressed. Two weeks later, after SBS unveiled the "Police Story" trilogy, I learned that I had found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong police officer who kills a major drug dealer. Chu (Yuen Chor) Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), is being held by the police as a witness against Chu, and Chan is assigned to protect her. Things go wrong - reevaluate badly - when Chu's case is dropped and he decides he wants Fong and Chan killed. <br /> <br /> "Police Story" is one of the greatest action movies of all time, and certainly one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies. It starts strong and ends with one of the most incredible action sequences ever filmed. Everything in between is great. However, some of the funny parts may seem a bit bland to more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, this is still one of Jackie's best efforts. For an action movie, the story is very good, and Jackie is a much better actor in this than in the intense and tangle 'New Police Story'. This is not 'Miracles', but maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of Jackie's best works. That gets me hooked on Jackie Chan movies, and should be a great start for any potential Jackie fan. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan movies are not much better - 10/10
