I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch. <br /> <br /> The acting is incredible, which is not hard to believe, since it's Daniel Day. <br /> <br /> Lewis, who is an incredible actor. Brenda Fricker is the wonder wonder, however. She captures her heart like the mother of a physically disabled boy who is not able to walk, or talks until he is late in adolescence. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough good things about the movie, but I will stop here. I recommend it to anyone who likes movies that are based on actual events, or just enjoy good dramas in general.
