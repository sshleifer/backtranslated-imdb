This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen in years. Her routine is hilarious and contributes to a great conversation with others who have seen her. I highly recommend this. The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the final jokes in French are very good, because you do not have to speak French to get it (although if you do, it's still hilarious). Also, the parts about being transvestite are very good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but funny for the first time. Hop over those if you can. Almost not worth watching. However, this really is a funny, funny show that everyone should see. "I was dead on the hour!"
