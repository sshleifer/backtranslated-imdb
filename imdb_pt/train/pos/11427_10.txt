I loved this movie because in my head it seemed to perfectly capture what I imagined life in French colonial Africa must have been like in the 50's ("my" generation anyway). But I was truly delighted with its peaceful pace and glorious end. In the last 5 minutes of this movie, you should focus intensely on what is happening. I've never been so impressed with the "end" of a movie. I remember yelling "wow!" when I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep on the couch !!
