Another one of those brilliant young people who did everything and dared to make a teenage romance movie (I call it that - that would invoke the devil of their fans) on a micro budget, but filled with such taste, sensitivity and maturity. Peter Sollett - you deserve more admiration and respect. Thank you once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the "industry" that stereotypes can be thrown into the toilet. A spot, a handful of rich characters, low budget, good acting (and also amateurs), decent lighting - true indie moviegoers should watch more of this and STOP watching ... well ... you know what.
