I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other eBay LaserDiscs. Usually, I'm into war and action movies, but sometimes I like romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you're bored with today's specials and romantic high-gloss comedies, you should check Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening. . What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency. There is nothing false or pretentious about them. Take Mr. Matuschek, for example: When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees, he tries to kill himself. Not just because of humiliation, but because he was unfair to Stewart's character. (OK, strange example). <br /> <br /> Yes, the focus of the film is narrow and the plot is predictable. Still, I liked it a lot. If you like Notting Hill then you will like to shop around the corner. In fact, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart.
