when you add up all aspects of the movie - dance, singing, acting - the only one who stands out as the best in the cast is Vanessa Williams ... her timeless dedication, energy and beauty make Rosie the perfect role model for her. I've never seen anyone portray Rose with such vitality! Vanessa's talent shows beautifully with all the songs she does, since Rose and her acting skills never cease to amaze me! Your dance is so incredible, even if some people say that the choreography was bad - their dancer skills were displayed better than ever! I would recommend this version over '63 just because I think that although Vanessa's acting is excellent ---- not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive too (with the exception of Chynna Philips ... what the hell were they thinking when they chose it?) <br /> <br /> Everyone says this version is wonderful and I recommend everyone to see that version!
