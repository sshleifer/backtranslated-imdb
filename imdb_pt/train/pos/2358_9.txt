Pushing Daisies is just a beautiful fairy tale, with aesthetic and romance shades of "Amelie". He has a beautiful palette, his thoughtful and detailed plans, his extravagant and very handsome names and dialogues to be real, his grandiose imagination and deep romance. <br /> <br /> Watch the blue in the pop sky on you, as the blue can not be found in the rest of the sets or shots (with few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Watch a strangely natural and totally satisfying song coming out of a scene. <br /> <br /> Your trail is beautiful, your cast is extremely nice, there are great songs, and the two main romantic stars can not touch each other or she will die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I'd like them to find a way around this one, but c'est la vie) <br /> <br /> It's simply a show that it's a pleasure to spend an hour with, and I highly recommend it. There was no other television like this, and I would like to see more. That made me sick for a bad week, because it's good company. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
