Why do people complain about this movie, not horrible movies like The Godfather? Titanic is the greatest film of the 21st century. With great acting, direction, effects, music and generally everything. This movie is always discarded by everyone, because one day someone said they did not like it anymore, so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie, not only being the most Oscar-winning film ever, the most lucrative of all time and unfortunately one of the most underrated films I've ever seen. Plus, it's truly the best movie ever. The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars trilogies and Lord of the Rings or anything from the masters Hitchcock, Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors, but none equal to James Cameron's masterpiece, TITANIC.
