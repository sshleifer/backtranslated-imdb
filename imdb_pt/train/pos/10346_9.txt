What happened in 1939, which helped produce so many great Hollywood films? Well, whatever it is, magic can also be found in this Columbia photo. It's a long-forgotten forgotten comedy that Turner Classic Movies began to show. (Maltin's book does not contain it.) In almost every department, the incredible Mr. Williams is a gem. <br /> <br /> It's the story of a first-class detective who can never find time to marry him. required. As the wedding bells are about to ring, he is called to the scene of a murder. The lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals, but to belong to the police force. There are lots of laughs in the process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas proved once again that he had few colleagues in light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the height of her career and it's a delight. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The movie is still a little too long, but who cares? The crazy comedies are always able to entertain, and this movie belongs to them with the best.
