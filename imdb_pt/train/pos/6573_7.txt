The film has a lot of feel to it from the beginning - I think it would be a better piece than a movie, because the setting and the drama make the film version look a bit too artificial. But still, it's done quite well, and the story and especially the dialogue are interesting. They took the dialogue exactly as it is of the piece itself. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's plays. <br /> <br /> The main character Raina has her head in the clouds and a talent for the dramatic, and Helena Bonham Carter's performance does a good job here. Her fiance, Serges, is a little caricatured when he really should be an extremely handsome figure. Your parents are fun enough.
