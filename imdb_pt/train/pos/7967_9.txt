This is definitely one of the biggest Disney movies ever made. It is a pleasure for anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and this will put you in suspense. <br /> <br /> Basically, what Homeward Bound is about three domestic animals that are sent to live on a farm. while their owners go on vacation. They do not know what's going on, and desperately want to go home, they escape the farm and try to find their way home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last films that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly Golden Retriever. Also starring in this film was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is is Chance! Dubbed by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is basically everything you'd expect from a dog, amiable, playful, energetic and playful, and every time I fall apart when I watch this movie, it's about of Chance; It's like the comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is also very sad at times. Sometimes it reminds people of the times they were alone or when they lost their pets. <br /> <br /> A scene that always leaves me in suspense is the scene in which the trio is trying to escape the pound; I'm particularly shocked at the part where Chance picks up the collar trapped in the fence and almost can not. The movie had other moments of suspense, but none for me seems more suspenseful than that. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a wonderful family movie. If you like this movie, you'll probably like the sequel as well. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
