Now I had the pleasure of seeing Pollinated Man for the first time when he made his TV debut in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An infectious disease specialist (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them. . Now, a few years later, he is now in Russia or somewhere. I do not know exactly where, all I know is that it happens somewhere in that area. Either way, because of budget cuts in an infectious disease laboratory, they are forced to lay off most of their workers. One of them, a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Weller, better known for his role as the indestructible Robocop) walks in there and demands that they return the job. He needs this job because he is divorced and must pay for the child's support. Then he goes in there, a fight erupts and some things are knocked over, dangerous things. It is soon discovered that Muller was infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it is so deadly, a drop of your blood will kill a person in a matter of seconds. Soon the news is released and the disease specialist (Hurt) is called to investigate and then associated with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to come home to see his wife and son and will not stop at anything, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said before, this movie is very much like Falling Down. . We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) who will stop at nothing to accomplish his goal even though they have to kill some people in the process. Then there's a heroine (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down) who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist. <br /> <br /> The Contaminated Man is actually a very good movie with a good story. line and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
