Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've seen in ages. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the womanizer who has cases with three girls and gets involved at the same time. John Abraham is fun sometimes and this is one of his best jobs so far. Paresh Rawail is superb as usual in most of his films. Director Priyadarshan has produced great movies in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are some of the best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he has ever made. The three newcomer actresses are medium-sized. Rimi sen does not have much reach in this film. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple story of a guy having a case with three girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with loads of laughter, this is a Non Stop Entertainer.
