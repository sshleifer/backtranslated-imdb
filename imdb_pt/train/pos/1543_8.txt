I remember seeing this movie years ago, I think, BBC2. I'd love to see you again - does anyone know how I can get a copy? As I recall, it was an especially powerful film, in particular the scene that stands out is the horses wearing gas masks. Also, I really can not remember much of the story - and that's why I want to see it again! I scoured the web but could not find a copy, which is unusual in my experience - there may not be any DVD or VHS of that movie on the market. I would appreciate any help anyone can give me about it. Many thanks in advance for your help. Sincerely, Albany234@googlemail.com
