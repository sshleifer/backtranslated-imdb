"Zabriskie Point" (1970): Was this especially interesting for me on a personal level, since it occurs in identical circumstances, with identical pairs, in my life? the Counter Culture movement of the late 1960s / early 1970s, on and off campus. We follow two unrelated young people in separate stories, which are slowly intertwined. One is a young man in Los Angeles, tired of all the endless pseudo-revolutionary gossip in the classrooms and dining rooms of his campus and the other a young woman heading to Phoenix to see her father and his boss and take up a job of "establishment". The film is full of the visual notes of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni) about America, and the confused and psychedelic of the time, "we all know, we will change everything for the better" youth. Who is the "revolutionary"? What does it really mean? Do you dress like one and march singing? Do you "fly under the radar" but warn in advance of your arrival? Do you keep your plans to yourself and take care of the change without the group's approval? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "period piece" - full of slang, uniforms, surreal movie moments (after all, this is a man movie that gave us the incredible "Blow Up" of 1966) and the artifacts of the time. , but it is more. It presents options for the cultural revolution, and by going through Antonioni (who seem to support it), young people are very self-involved to see what is needed for radical success. Because of this, it becomes a powerful and scary movie that applies to anyone, anytime, anywhere.
