I have personally seen many Disney movies in my life, though absolutely none of them combine in any way with Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I personally did not cross live action with animation, it was an improvement to try to dress people as animation characters. The film places three evacuees from World War II who are sent to stay with a quiet and socially awkward woman in the country. I would have to say that the cast was brilliant. Angela Landsbury made a perfect Miss Price, while David Thomilson made a great love interest for desperate artists. The finals always surprise me and this was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, though I did not know if it was intentional. The dialogue was not great, but considering it was designed to be a children's movie, that's fine. Overall, I would give performance nine out of ten, dialogue six out of ten, cast in nine out of ten and outfits in eight out of ten.
