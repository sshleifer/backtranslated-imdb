This is a very moving picture of about three friends in their mid-thirties in a small town in England. One finds a passionate love and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor, when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever. Definitely a movie to have a box of tissues with you! A powerful work. This is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * The main character is taken by his handsome young piano instructor and a passionate flower romance. His two envious "friends" make an immature joke that quickly leads to tragedy. She loses her love and her friends in a single fault. In the end, an unexpected surprise unites them again (in my opinion, forgiveness is not guaranteed)
