I was hoping this was the same kind of movie as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, which is why I left it unseen for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from being a succession of films. silly arduous battles and car / boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a beautiful girl becomes as hard as nails, with nothing being overdone or overly rationalized. <br /> <br /> It is likely that budget constraints really helped with this: less time and effort were spent on finding increasingly stupid ways for stuntmen to pretend to die, and more was devoted to making the film worth seeing. Hell, the biggest battle of weapons happens off-screen - and the scene in which it is heard is best for that background noise, which increases suspense - who is winning? Who's dying? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as pretty as Monica Vitti, but few are, and she certainly has all the kind of class and fire needed to make the character work - and the shape of her face, her hair and his tall, slim body could have been taken directly from the comic book charts. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise villain, in which he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch - even enjoyable (and I doubt I would consider taking on many brutal killers and psychopaths as drink friends). I can not think of any of the Hollywood "ex-waiters" who could have taken the role of that good. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise's villains always die in the end (no spoilers there!). a very good thing, because all the girls who would spend their time fainting in such a disgustingly beautiful and interesting piece can now settle for the ordinary Joes.
