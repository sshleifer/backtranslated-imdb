Before regular reviews, my main curiosity about THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE is that while there is a 94-minute duration listed in the IMDb, the Wellspring Media DVD in the United States runs in 88 minutes. Any comment on this is appreciated! <br /> <br /> Two friends with very difficult lives take the path to an adventure. What they end up with is exactly that, with one accidentally shooting at a girl and the two fleeing on foot into the field. Instead of just a big chase, the film is complicated by the fact that the crazy and half-child Spike behaves inappropriately, and holding his device like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not like the story based solely on the Spike character, but without a bit of added frustration to the story, the film would have been too easy. You'll notice how Heaton's most stable character refers to Spike as "big man" in contrast to Spike's "out of control" attitude and behavior. Frankly, I was also aggravated by Spike's ridiculous actions, especially the smelling spray can, but in a desperate situation it is evident that someone from his mentality would choose a temporary escape. But, Heaton was there to keep things under control until things went over his head as well. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a marvel, and after a while I stopped wondering why on earth he would want to take Spike out of prison and continue a friendship due to Glenaan's terrific performance. After all, there are many reasons during the race that it would be a good idea for Heaton to abandon Spike and try to save himself. I suppose Heaton felt like a protective older brother to Spike, and their loyalty is hard to break-until things get very desperate. <br /> <br /> Although part of the cinematography is really artistic, it offers more flavor to the story, rather than just shots of men running through the desert. The beautiful scenery, the rain and the vast gray skies offer a somber tone that adds to the sense of tragic circumstances. The result is also unusual, and the use of Public Image Ltd.'s "This Is Not A Love Song" and how the title of the film is quite clever. <br /> <br /> In general, it is understandable if you do not care about THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE, as it is focused on two contrasting personalities escaping from another man determined to hunt them down (played by a legal and quiet David Bradley). It's not big-budget action entertainment. For the rest of us who enjoy looking for something minimal and dramatic, it is time that it is worth spending, and offers some extremely tense moments that hold you breath a little. <br /> <br /> I'm really enjoying the movies coming out of Scotland recently, with the likes of this one, Dog Soldiers, and The Devil's Tattoo. I'm also grateful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, since the accents are sometimes fast and difficult for some viewers as I see fit. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, somber and often tense, THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE is very tragic, yet engaging, telling stories. <br /> <br />
