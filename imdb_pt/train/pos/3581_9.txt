I had seen this movie in the 80's and had almost forgotten when I realized I was on the TV again and watched. I remembered liking that little sleeper when I first saw him, and I liked it even more on the second show. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest and Jason Presson (as the 12-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental death of his big brother) is superb. The film has a very genuine feel - a discreet, silent, deeply moving story of a family suffering from pain. Dialogue is sparse but revealing, and nonverbal performance is excellent. More or less like a simpler, rural version of ordinary people, without a psychiatrist, but also impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> The Stone Kid is well worth the time and the emotional energy involved in watching it.
