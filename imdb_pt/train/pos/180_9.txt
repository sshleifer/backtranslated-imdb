When Gundam0079 became the movie trilogy that most of us are familiar with, much of it was pure action and less of anything else. This OVA is the opposite. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not full of action but emotional things. The two main action sequences, I believe, are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many Gundam series, movies and OVAs, I was completely ready for a civil-esquire movie. This movie did a fantastic job of it. What makes this movie stand out is that it shows that both sides of the war have good and bad people. This made the Zeons seem more human than the original films, where they are described as the second rise of the evil Nazis. Most people who do not like anime that I forced to watch this movie (lol), they liked it. So I would recommend it to many people just for anti-war history. If you're a Gundam fan, and you did not see it, you should not be reading this; You should be watching now.
