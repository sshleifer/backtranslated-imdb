The Running Man is often dismissed as just another Arnie action thriller filled with explosions, puns and shootings, and to be fair, there is much of it. People used to look at him and compare him to the Terminator series, saying it was one of Schwarzenegger's poorer films. <br /> <br /> But, give it 18 years, and you will find yourself being able to enjoy it in a different light. Instead of being just another brainless action movie, it works just fine as a parody of the reality show. It's quite different from Stephen King's book, of course, but I doubt that Hollywood, with his love of optimistic endings and the so-called "ordinary guys" who ended up having the skills of a trained command, would have accepted it in his book. current form. <br /> <br /> But with the review. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop who works in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the whole country is governed by a merger of government / media conglomerate. The economy is in tatters, food is scarce, and the state keeps people distracted, producing sadistic games for them to watch, such as Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for cash over a pit of angry dogs, and the most popular is The Running Man, a game show hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the fun Richard Dawson) where alleged "criminals" are hunted by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'pursuers'. <br /> <br /> Some, however, try and speak against the government. When a group of hungry people holds a protest in the city of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to "calm down" (ie kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to shoot innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labor camp, but escapes with the help of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and runs away. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long, and then he kidnaps the network. Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those who pursue him, he finds himself arrested again, but this time he is forced to appear in The Running Man. <br /> And then, of course, the whole movie enters standard Arnie mode. Richards is cast in the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why LA is always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) And forced to flee from the "stalkers," along with two other prisoners who escaped from the field with him. Amber is also curious about Richards' protests of innocence and finds out that he was framed. Guess what happens to her then? So like Amber, Richards and the other two guys try to avoid the stalkers, we soon realize that Richards is not an ordinary cop. He's the Super Arnie, the one-man army that can bring down corporate evil dictatorships and fight obese men covered with Christmas lights, being just an American guy with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the film becomes dumb, loud, Arnie's 1980's fun funky. There are many exciting fighting sequences, the trademark terrifying puns ('He had to split' being my favorite), and the overall stereotyped final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun to watch Killian react to him in the typical 'healthy' way, and some of the show's funniest moments revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the audience as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the damned old lady! ) and the cold, scienti fi c man that he is, in fact, will do anything to increase the audience. <br /> <br /> If you expect a high-profile, intelligent movie, you will be disappointed. But if you want a great 80's movie, well, that's it. But the best thing about this movie is that it was quite prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you look at the entertainment we have today, you will have noticed how the reality show goes nowadays - shows with people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It is not too difficult to imagine that some vile TV presenter has tried to get the right to show that people are performed live on TV. We have had this, however, with al-Qaeda's macabre repudiation decapitating videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine watching the actual death on their television sets. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything nowadays seems to be a revival of the 80's, you have to be impressed by the clairvoyance of this movie. Of course, we have not gotten there yet as terrorists, not the mainstream media, have bought us programs that are easily available with real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it takes before some executive decides to see if he can find a way to launch a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to satisfy their morbid curiosity ...
