It seems that Hal Hartley's films are a kind of hit or miss in most audiences. This movie will not be an exception to this rule. Fay Grim acts as a follow-up to Hartley's "Henry Foole" in 1998. The focus this time is on Henry's ex-wife (played with perfection by the always welcome Parker Posey), who is being pestered by CIA henchmen about the unheard Henry's book about his obscure business. In the meantime, Fay ends up on an odyssey, dealing with international spies, etc. The movie gets a little bogged down in the second half. If you have been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is a not to be missed. For novice Hartley, the first timer, who has only heard of his technique of making movies, you may want to check out his previous films before choosing this one (especially if you have not yet seen 'Henry'). I admired the camera work, which sometimes reminded me of a certain initial photograph of Man Ray.
