With the number of actors working on the project, they have a wide variety of castings. Nice CGI starship in places, but your green screen needs some work. Anyone who has heard of Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it to improve their typing. <br /> <br /> The stories are well thought out, many elements of trek to keep you in the right context. BUT the idea of ​​two kissing guys makes me advance the episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can not help that I do not meet men kissing fun (do not care about women). Anyway ... For a lot of fans this is good. With minor improvements in its green screen, brush action and some orientation ratings, this series is impressive. Anyway I recommend this series to anyone who has ever liked TNG and DS9.
