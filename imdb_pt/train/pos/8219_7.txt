The Dirty Harry series began with very brave police action, and was almost immediately relieved by "Magnum Force." By the time "The Enforcer" rolled around, Dirty Harry was little more than a television program (except for Tyne Daly). After an interval of seven years, Dirty Harry has finally returned to its roots. Maybe he'd been away for a long time this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood makes Harry's first well-directed film since Don Siegel made the first, which helps considerably. Harry is a darker character once again, not the cool cop he has become. He can once again say things like "Go ahead, make my day" and really be honest. "Sudden Impact" is a true sequel to Dirty Harry. "The Enforcer" should never have been done. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
