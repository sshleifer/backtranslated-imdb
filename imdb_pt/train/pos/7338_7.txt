Fire And Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world. The movie is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the lord of the evil ice named Nekron. The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn, who decides to avenge those who have been killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the earth princess named Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn goes out in search of her and also seeks to find and kill Nekron. Fire And Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi, who is one of my favorite adult entertainers. He brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of Fritz The Cat and some films that he himself wrote, such as the great movie Heavy Traffic. I did not like Fire And Ice almost as much as I have Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I still find the film enjoyable. It had some really good animations in parts and the story was fun enough. The only basic complaints I have is that I wish there was one more story for the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not much to do. I would also like the movie to be a little longer because it is less than 80 minutes at run time. It's still a fun action-adventure movie that, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic, is suitable for children ages 8 and up. I just wanted to have a more developed story that was a little longer than what happened.
