This game show lasted only a season but was intriguing to the audience because it required visual aptitude and a firm hand. A false move would disqualify the competitor from winning the prize, even though it was clear that the competitor knew the correct answer. It was always exciting when the competitor began to draw, wondering if they would complete the drawing or whether they were humming; allowing the other competitor to easily win the contest. It was a joyful spectacle, but it was clear that competitors were often embarrassed by a silly mistake made unintentionally. Rarely seen, the game show did not survive after a single season. Only a game show addict will remember this show, since it proved to be quite unpopular, even though the shows were making a big comeback to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950s games. But it was a unique concept for a game show, and that was never seen again.
