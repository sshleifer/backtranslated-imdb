Before being cast as Nick Charles in the Thin Man series, William Powell played another urban detective named Philo Vance. The supporting cast is strong on this first talkie, and Powell's star quality is evident. Mary Astor, who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy, does a good job here as the woman who stands in the middle of it all.
