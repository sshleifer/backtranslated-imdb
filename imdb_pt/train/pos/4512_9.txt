I saw this movie today and I have to say, it was much better than I expected it to be about two hours before I went to see it. Personally I had some prejudice because of his language, but that totally changed my idea. The film was in most cases surprisingly good with the great performances of actors and actresses. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it. This really touched me and as a movie, which is based on a true story, convinced me. A new school, a psychopath director and a boy who becomes known with a new teacher, a little different from the others and who fights for things even though they do not seem to work. It showed how small things can make great changes in many things, and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations. I also think that the selections of actors have been successful. It really looked like you had been a person watching the episodes like a stranger when they happened. Before spoiling this movie with praises, I have to admit that there were some things and situations that did not look and were realistic ... like the one where the school principal beat Frits aka. Martin in front of the group at the end of the film. He really was badly beaten but the only thing that caused him was a little blood coming from his nose when compared to the first beating in the beginning when Frits got some points ... well, I think every movie has its own failures ... I have to say that if I ever find a DVD from the store, it's a sure thing that I take with me.
