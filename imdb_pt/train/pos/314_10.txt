This show is a great story. It has everything from slavery, how they were treated, religion, the ways in which the Jews were sent into hiding, the inquisition, the belief in the orix√°, the African gods, the way women were treated, including daughters . Even homosexuality. The way the characters are intertwined and that Violante, this character saddens me. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her. I'm so glad they decided to relaunch it for you again. Although I would love to see the unedited version. Xica became my heroine. I look at the way she uses her power to help everyone who seeks her. I love all the characters and have discovered that they can relate to many people now in this century. I look forward to my Xica every night. It would be great to dub in English so the Americans can love it, too.
