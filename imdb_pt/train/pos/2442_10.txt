This film is about one side of Ireland that Americans do not usually see, the side of biased religious prejudice of the 'friendliest race in the world'. The film, by the admission of the inhabitants of Fethard who are old enough to remember the events, is quite precise (although they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the most violent scenes just to spice up the action). The film was very unpopular in Ireland as it portrayed the Catholic Church in a bad light, but the fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church organized minority vetoes (before the Protestants were Jews). <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating insight into the whole question of religion in Ireland
