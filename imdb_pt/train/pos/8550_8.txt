Now I love American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for the performance of Seann William Scott as Stifler but after that the quality dropped. Band Camp kept the pattern fairly high with characters you really cared about, but Naked Mile was the same joke and the plot lines were recycled (Erik Stifler's sexual problem is like Jim's). He had some fun times like the football game against the dwarves and the 'punishment' of Coozeman, but overall lacked originality and the 'Mile' was just stupid and dumb. Not to mention the annoying girlfriend who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough on the Naked Mile. I watched Beta House with apprehension as I thought I could take the series to a new low, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, there's no real plot, but it's full of hot girls (Ashley's amazing) and sex jokes aplenty. Yes, it's stereotyped and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with a lush performance. The Greek Olympics are fun, especially the penultimate and final events, while the participation of Christopher McDonald is hilarious. There are weaknesses though. Coozeman is just as annoying as at first, I'm still puzzled by how he got a part. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Naked Mile a pain to watch, but at Beta House, he takes his performance to a new low. In the first place it lacks charisma, a prerequisite Stifler. You really can not care less about him. The only reason I was bothered by his relationship was that Ashley might be on the screen! She shines above him like the rest of the cast. Seriously John White is the ultimate in bad acting and has as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> To say that the movie is fun and Coozeman's fear that the girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth rented, have some of your friends and laugh at the vomit-fest event and vent your anger at Erik 'loser' Stifler.
