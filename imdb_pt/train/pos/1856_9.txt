He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in 'Glory', he proved that he was not a mediocre actor of 'Malcolm in the Middle' in 'Malcolm X', he showed his brotherly love for acting in 'Philadelphia', he did a slam dunk in `He Got Game ', he did not punch and rocked us like a hurricane in' The Hurricane ', he provided us with effective thespian education in' Training Day ', and now he demonstrated that he could also drive! The Denzel Washington premiere, "Antwone Fisher," is the most moving film of the year. This tearjerker 'fish'er story has nothing to do with the disaster that struck the Miami Dolphins in the fourth quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike the dolphin tragedy, Antwone Fisher has a conclusion emotional and joyful. The film is based on a true story about a young Navy officer who has an anger control problem because of the abominable he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and convinces him to find his natural mother. The premiere performance of Derek Luke as Antwone is the best admirable performance I've seen by a novice actor sometime now. In fact, I've seen some of the eccentricities detailed in Luke's performance, as I've seen in Washington's past performances. It was as if Washington was telling Luke - 'la la la, I am your acting father.' It's ok! I'm going to set aside Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from Master D himself? "Antwone Fisher" was written by none other than Antwone Fisher himself. The pathetic emotional that he inserted in the script of his history was of material "king of the fisherman". I salute the head Mr. Washington 'on getting the right bait on' Antwone Fisher '. ***** Great
