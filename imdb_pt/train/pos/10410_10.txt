The Baghdad thief is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. It's breathless without blood, it's beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless. The cast could not have been better. Rex Ingram made me believe in geniuses. And the epitome of evil is surely captured by Conrad Veight as Jafar. He set the bar high. <br /> <br /> I watch this movie at least twice a year ... and I never get tired of it. This movie is an adventure for all ages .. no one too old to have fun. The thief of Bahgdad runs my memories for a more innocent moment ... I was ten years old the first time I saw and the US was about to enter World War II. Conrad Vieght was a great actor who was able to continue this underlying "malice" a few years later in "Casablanca". And Korda joined, I believe, with Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers" .... excellent film production!
