the only word that sums up this movie is peculiar. is a joyful joke through an existential concept. Bouncy (in more ways than one) and a little nutty. I would not exactly say it's a grand and unforgettable movie and it does not look as memorable as the director's first film, "Cube," but it's a good fluff pit to watch on a Sunday morning. the acting goes from respectable to annoying at times, but I believe that this is how it should be written. made like a serious movie, maybe it could have been great or gotten into a state of pretense. rather like "the matrix" meets "head" meets "human nature". 6.8 out of ten
