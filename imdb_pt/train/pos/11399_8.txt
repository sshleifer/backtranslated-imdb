Okay, so the plot is on unstable ground. Yes, that's fine, so there are some songs and / or randomly inserted dance sequences (eg, Adam's concert and Henri's stage). And Leslie Caron can not really, um, you know ... take action. <br /> <br /> But somehow 'An American In Paris' succeeds in all this as a polished, first-class musical - largely based on Gene Kelly's incredible dance and choreography talent, and on the chariot trucks he seems to be importing in every scene with Caron. (He needs it, because she seems to have a ... problem with emoting.) The most talented and technically inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet at the end of the movie. It's amazingly filmed, and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully. But my favorite number would have to be Kelly's character singing 'I Got Rhythm' with a bunch of French schoolchildren, after breaking a series of American dances. This proves that you do not need special effects when you have some real talent. <br /> <br /> Not at the 'classic' level with 'Singin' In The Rain ', but beautiful up there, though. Worth the watch!
