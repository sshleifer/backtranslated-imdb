When I first heard about this movie I thought it would be like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria I knew this would not just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really incredible and the settings are also beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really let me down is the performances. Emily Blunt is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this film she shows that she is a great actress and perhaps choosing a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost tasteless like Prince Albert, but he has a great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne, although I expected more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have supporting roles, but they are forgettable. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie seems unfinished. Maybe the writers have changed a lot in the script, I do not know, but that's how I feel about the movie. <br /> <br /> But overall it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria performing well. by Emily Blunt.
