I got this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I was anticipating a lot when it arrived. My worst fears were that it would be laborious as well ... well, do you know what all the screaming fans were chattering about? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? That sort of thing? Fearing this. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly watchable, even though filming and music made it look as if someone was going to end up with a couple of nuns in every two scenes, and Gackt's acting was very good. Hyde, being, Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend / gang member character that anyone who saw him onstage would hardly be surprised by. He is one of my two biggest groups with the movie itself. But the rest of the cast (including the children's actors in the opening scene) was very good at doing what they did - which was mostly shot and shouted. But my second problem was very small, related to gore. It seemed very suspense-horror to me - like all the scenes where someone is shot, they fall, really dead, or stay there bubbling for a long time. But Sho just ... takes the pictures, repeatedly, cries, bubbles a lot while talking, and makes Hyde cry. All in all, whether you're a fan of any of the actors or just a fan of j movies, it's definitely worth watching.
