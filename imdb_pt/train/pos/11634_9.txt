I also just got back from an advanced Redeye show and I must say I have not had so much fun in a movie for a long time. WES CRAVEN is at his best. It brings us an incredible end to summer suspense that I was so desperately longing for. This is the thriller of the year .. no doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun. The F / X were excellent. Constantly built suspense. I was on the edge of my chair for most of the movie. It's been a while since I've heard an audience clap and clap and get excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for thrills, action and a good plot this summer, REDEYE offers. Go and see!
