I was not sure what to expect with this, apart from the positive reviews I read. It turns out that I could never have imagined this movie because it is very close to "The White Haired Bride" in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic. This walks a fine line between being a farce, a comedy and just a good story of old fashioned ghosts. There's nothing scary about it, that's not the theme, it's actually mostly a love story that deals with a clumsy face that encounters a beautiful ghost, who is in many problems with other ghosts. So the main theme is the guy trying to save the cute ghost. This also happens in ancient China, with strange Kung Fu exhibits and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the action ghosts are pretty cool, and the visual effects are high quality by the end. I have been able to watch this genre of Chinese movies all day because they are so much fun, great visuals and almost ironic. And I look forward to watching the first installment of this movie as well. Highly recommended.
