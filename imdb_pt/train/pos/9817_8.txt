I remember that movie. Pretty intense for an 11 year old. Good edition, I felt terrible for St. Bernard. I would see it again if it was retransmitted, but the signal is going through Pluto as I write this. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm glad I did not live in that neighborhood. Oh those 70's. What a decade. If they do, I bet it would be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An excellent film for pre-pubescent suburban boys. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not done in Lodi NJ. The shot with Sao Bernardo was the best and obviously the most astonishing image of the movie ... and then they left the carcass on the porch. Rotten children.
