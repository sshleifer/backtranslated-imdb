A wonderful film version of the best-selling book and Broadway play touches on the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters who have lived more than 100 years and told their story of witnessing a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll do very good performances like Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, the white reporter for the New York Times whose article on the sisters has released the book, etc. Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the current ones are very powerful, if not so inspiring. as in the book. That is the only real disadvantage, combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not clearly presented, such as the interracial background of the sisters' mother and why her father was so severe. But in addition, a very well done, excellently accomplished and powerful film.
