Of course it's cheesy, it's not Zombie, but it's not that bad either. There's Beatrice Ring, which is a huge bonus, and it's fun. I was lucky enough to meet Fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience because he was never completely satisfied with it. It's worth a search, especially for fans of the genre and the Fulci. It is a film that is often discarded out of hand.
