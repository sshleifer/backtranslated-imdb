I read some terrible things about this movie so I was prepared for the worst. "Confused, confusing, horribly structured." While there may be merit for some of these accusations, this movie was not nearly as horrible as its ordinary DVD programmer. In fact, he had aspirations. Tried something beyond the typical monster / slasher nonsense. And by God, there are some interesting things going on. <br /> <br /> Ms. Barbeau is a miracle to see. She carries the film directly on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> That does not mean it's a masterpiece. UNHOLY finally collapses under the weight of its own ambition. There are many inexplicable subplots trying to coexist. And the gaps created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows her mother is evil and she will eventually kill her brother, then why does not she simply kill Ma in the first sequence of the movie? It would seem that it would have been better than traveling to the future to do so. <br /> <br /> Still, I give UNHOLY points for trying. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
