Poor Ivy: Although born, she had the misfortune to marry a charming spendthrift (Richard Ney). Because the film is set in the 1920s or 1930s, when rigid Victorian class ideas were beginning to wear on the edges, this uncertain status unduly irritates it. The Gretorexes (therefore, they are called) do not know where their next shilling comes from, but there are yachting parties and elegant balls in pleasing pleasures to tempt her. When Ivy (Joan Fontaine) makes the acquaintance of an older and wealthy gentleman (Herbert Marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), she puts one of his extravant chapeaux into it. Fortunately, one of the beaux she still wears (Patric Knowles) is a doctor whose offices provide a stash of poison, with which she takes her husband's leave. The fact that it involves Knowles does not interrupt her a bit, even over the hours until he should be hanged by the neck until he dies. The plot change depends on Police Inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke; The mother of Knowles (the fearsome Lucile Watson); and the loyal governess of Knowles (Una O'Connor). Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this melodrama well above average; Fontaine's luminous face provides the rest.
