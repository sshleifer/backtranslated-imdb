As his first masterpiece "The Elephant Man," Lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a simple, straightforward story without losing his artistic touch. This is a true story of a retired old man (cleverly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to ride a tractor in some states to make a last visit to his brother who is now near death. A beautiful soundtrack of Badalamenti, exquisite photograph of rural life (love of cornfield aerial shots) and a hand of a shrewd director who reveals mankind's basic humanity, this is a beautiful slice of the film of life. Its extremely slow pace can calm some viewers to sleep, but those who remain for the ride will be well rewarded in the end.
