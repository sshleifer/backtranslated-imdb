Paul was totally stolen by someone in the primordial who made Dave. It's the same story, though it's not so funny. <br /> <br /> Paul told me this morning about the scene where sammy davis sings the new national anthem of the parador. he arrived in Brazil after a long flight of vegas, three planes, a ride to the set, and so on. he was defeated. he could hardly stand, had to use a cane. he was staying in a trailer the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> He did not know he could do it. so he saw the crowd of 6000 extras, paid 7 dollars. he came to life and they recorded this scene for two hours. he was magnificent, so it almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a cool guy, though very liberal. a real talent.
