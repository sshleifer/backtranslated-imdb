I saw this movie when I was a kid. This surprised me. That was before the days of television, so a movie of this magnitude could send a child into orbit. I was so impressed that I went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this point were far ahead of their time. Sabu was a real delight, as was Rex Ingram as the genius. I saw myself singing "I want to be a sailor" for months after the movie left town. I would recommend this movie to everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was as villainous a character as you would like to meet. Besides, June Duprez was never more adorable than she was in this photo. The color was excellent. Give this movie a AAA!
