Having read some of the other reviews here I was expecting something truly horrible but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY VERIFICATION: The original series was not so good. I think some people remember it with more affection than they deserved, but in addition to Daisy Duke's car chases and legs, the scripts were weak and poorly executed. The boys of Duke were very smart and smart to the backwoods of the forest, the shrunken Boss Hog was too crap to be bad and Rosco was only hyper at all times of the screen. It's incredible that the series actually lasted as long as it did, because it ran out of story lines during the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you watch this movie by itself, not as a direct comparison to what you remember the TV series, then it is not bad at all. The real star is of course General Lee. The car chases and stunts are excellent and this is really what D.O.H. it's all about. Johnny Knoxville is his eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo, the couple makes this really funny movie in a hilarious type of Dumb-And-Dumber that the TV series never got. The lovely Jessica Simpson is a girl like Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much better Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes Rosco P. Coltrane incredibly unpleasant, just the way he always should have been. <br /> <br /> If you do not like clowning humor and crazy car stunts then you would not be watching this movie anyway because you should know what to expect. Otherwise, if you want a fun car action movie with some good laughs that is not too draining to the brain, then go see that nice joke with an open mind.
