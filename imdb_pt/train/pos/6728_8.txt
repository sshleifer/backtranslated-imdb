I stumbled into this movie on the cable and got totally hooked. The story of a group of surfers who travel large waves, monstrously huge waves that make any rational person flee in terror is one that can be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves. There is nothing special about the film, as well as gathering some very interesting people who are passionate about what they do and who they talk about. Of course there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is the people. Here are a lot of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do, that it passes on to people watching. Halfway to this movie you will want to go out and learn to surf too. Few documentaries have managed to cover the passion these people have and the ability to make us feel capable of making this movie a great movie. Look.
