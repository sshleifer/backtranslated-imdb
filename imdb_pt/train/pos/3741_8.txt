War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971. He follows a group of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland - a precise portrayal of Vietnam on American soil before being sent. He focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... as they meet, become friends and deal with a squad leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a psychopath (Shea Wingham). <br /> <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a handheld camera for most of the film and uses digital video for combat scenes. It works very well - the film looks bold (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully masks his Irish accent and adopts a pretty convincing Southern accent. His performance is simply superb - he is an extremely talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not that good. He is tall, muscular, very handsome - and very dull. The rest of the cast, however, is simply great. <br /> <br /> This movie was played out by his studio. It had no stars, it was a family story and was considered "just another war movie". Played only a week in Boston! Worth getting on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> In addition, Farrell and Davis have a long nudity scene.
