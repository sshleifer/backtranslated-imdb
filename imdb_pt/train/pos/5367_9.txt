This film is one of the most underrated films of its time. By watching this movie, you are full of action, and when some things do not happen, the mood is incompatible. Shiny writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix of a game show where criminals are competing, and a near future where the general public all have a blood thirst. Also Arnold did not disappoint us with some of your best linings. I do not want to ruin anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives his sentence "I'll be back." He gets the best response from all of them in this movie. I hope you enjoy this gem as much as I did.
