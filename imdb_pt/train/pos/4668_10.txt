This movie is now appearing on digital TV at least once a month, I watched it a dozen or more times, and it never fails to amaze me. If it were tomorrow, I would watch it again. Such is the art that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great magicians of the profession of actor, can create, helped not much by the excellent trio of support of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. Not forgetting the others in smaller roles. <br /> <br /> It is a simple tale, simply counted, of an ex-convict, an adorable fraudster, struggling and succeeding with then-new-age technology, that is, computers, and finding affection in the process . Even if it's a bit relentless, even unbelievable, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and best of all is that no horrible method is so common these days. A real lesson for modern filmmakers on how to make a great show out of, virtually, nothing ... except exceptional talents.
