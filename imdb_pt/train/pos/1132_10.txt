Your Hollywood imitating Daytiem Soap Opera at its best! It's the fun we never see. Great characters and great lines. Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is so over the top .... Gary Marshalls lines are a riot .... this is what I love about good comedies. Never fear to mock yourselves !!!!!! The sets were great ... wardrobe was on point and stabbing "Montana Morehead" was a diabolical delight. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but still it was beautiful and fun when on the screen. I'd love to know how the idea came to this movie. I've never seen a cast of people have so much fun doing comedy work! Soapdish is a must have and I'm waiting for the DVD !!!
