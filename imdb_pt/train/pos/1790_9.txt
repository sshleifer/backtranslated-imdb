I love this movie and it is a wonderful example of a danger to the family, a romantic love story and a very sad story. Everything was so perfect and excellent about this movie. It was such a great mix of actors and actresses and with a few laughs and many screams that this movie deserves to receive many awards. With the mention of the beautiful scenery, and although I relate this movie with The Notebook and The Family Stone, it was kind of much smarter, sad and brilliant than those films. The Evening tells of a love story between an elderly woman who dreams of her youth and her two daughters stand by her side while she is not well. The story that is back is so strongly told and wonderful that I was sitting on the edge of my seat. You really know all the characters and in the end, I was wanting to watch it all over again. This is an incredibly sad and vividly portrayed and plotted film that is really unique and should be seen by everyone as it is truly wonderful. All the performances are amazing and the film captures your attention from the beginning and never lets go. I loved it, and I'm so glad I watched it, because it was really an amazing movie ...
