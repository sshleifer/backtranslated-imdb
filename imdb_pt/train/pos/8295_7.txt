Robert Urich was a great actor, and he makes this TV movie believable. I remember watching that movie when I was 15, and when I saw it a second time, my opinion remains the same. People lose who they were when they enter this exclusive club in a Californian city rich in computers. Urich tries to find out what's wrong with his family and I love the idea of ​​the shiny Halloween costume. This movie is about someone's spirit battle. TV quality that exceeds, the big budget, New York Gangs. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his films? I believe so! 6 or 7 out of 10.
