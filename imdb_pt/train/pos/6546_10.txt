I'm probably one of Nancy Drew's biggest fans out there. I've read all the books three times and played many of Nancy's plays. I loved this movie. It kept you entertained the whole time you watched. I went with about 10 of my friends and everyone raved about it. There were three women sitting behind us who seemed to be in their late 30's to the early 40's and I asked them how they liked it, they said they said they loved it! So you see it will be an entertainment for all ages. You just have to give it a try. And also teach a lesson, be yourself, even if everyone around you is exactly the same. So overall, this move was great. I'll see for the second time now! So stop beating please. It's a very good movie!
