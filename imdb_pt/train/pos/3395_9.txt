This is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women see the same movie. I talked to a lot of people about the movie and almost all the guys loved it and said it was brilliant - while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only movie I know that has polarized visions based on the genre. Maybe many women have only a minor tolerance for disgusting or depressing scenarios - but whatever the cause, I've always found that fascinating difference. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation led by Charlton Heston. . This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international corporation Soylent was murdered. As the movie unfolds, you quickly realize that this is a terrible and highly unfair American society. The rich live in beautiful apartments safely and all the pleasures that money can buy (including "furniture" - a euphemism for paid lovers who come along with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are poor, unemployed and, in many cases, living in abandoned cars or apartment corridors. Overpopulation and smog have caused severe damage and the future looks horrible! <br /> <br /> Why the rich man died and the terrible truth with which he could not live I really should NOT argue - this could spoil the movie for you. However, the film has a great plot and acting and is super exciting to watch. In addition, he features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as Heston's crisp helper. Although not easily depressed or picky, this is a great science fiction film that is allegorical and profound.
