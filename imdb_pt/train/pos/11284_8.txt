When I was a kid, it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. I have often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan and I would not understand why since I saw some of the last Weismuller films in the character and I thought he was out of shape. It was not after many years that I came across "Tarzan and His Mate", and then I understood. Weismuller is fit in this image and has the sturdy presence and appearance that the character demands that has not yet been matched by other Tarzan such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Christopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> As for this film I was also surprised by the sensual presence of the beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, self-conscious, active, "no-inhibition" woman like Jane ahead of the times when the film was (Tarzan pushes her into a bare pond as she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and although she does not kiss him behind she kind of let him do it for a bit and does not do much of it); such behaviors were unthinkable with the coming Janes, such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, all making a very sweet and vulnerable type of woman, making it hard to believe that they could survive in a hostile place like African jungle. <br /> <br /> The glittering personality of the character O'Sullivan steals Tarzan's own show, except, of course, when it comes to action and Weismuller easily takes the lead; the combination is perfect. Another highlight in the film is the secondary role of Cheeta and not as the main clue, as in the later photos of Tarzan, where she often saves the day. "Tarzan and His Mate" is a great product in its genre (Tarzan films) and perhaps as the best, although I have to admit that I also liked Tarzan's "Great Adventure" (1959) ) made with a bigger budget and a strong support cast (and despite the only acceptable Gordon Scott in the lead role with his perfect "all over the gym" physique, which does not match with a rustic monkey man). Good for Jane and her mate!
