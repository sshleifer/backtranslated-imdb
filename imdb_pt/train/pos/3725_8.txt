There are four major films depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, Born on July 4, Platoon and finally Tigerland.) All but Tigerland focus on the real war and on the men.Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. Boz is one of the most important representations of a man who questions the war and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war films, but rarely in the field of training, besides being a very complex character whose method to deal with his Feelings and Emotions is the driving force of this film.A character from Boz makes this movie so good.It's a shame that it has not had a great release.It belongs to the shelf of any movie fan next to the movie titles mentioned above.
