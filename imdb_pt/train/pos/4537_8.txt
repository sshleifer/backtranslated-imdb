I saw the movie for the first time on the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyle, and I really wonder what Sherlock fans think about it. I also think it's a movie for these fans whether or not they agree on what's mentioned. You may wonder if A.C. Doyle was a strong person or put himself in question. However, he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much of that was a kind of semi-biography? Nevertheless, I strongly emphasize this adaptation, it is a movie you have to see - even if you are not interested in the Sherlock Holmes films or books - take a look, have fun and have your own opinion on it.
