Citizen X tells the real-life drama of the quest for a serial killer dubbed "The Rostov Ripper." This great film shows the long journey it took to try to arrest a murderer. The film shows how politics may have helped the killer continue his fury for over 12 years. (Possibly more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as the lead detective and Donald Sutherland as the general leader of the investigation were excellent. Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the kind of movie that will hypnotize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the actual case. This movie should not be missed. It premiered I believe in HBO and never got a theatrical release to my understanding. Great movie
