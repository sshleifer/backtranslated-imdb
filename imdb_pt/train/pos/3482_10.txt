This is my first comment on the IMDb site, and the reason I'm writing is that we're talking about one of the best movies ever! 'Ne goryuy!' will make you laugh and cry at the same time, you will fall in love (if you are not already a fan!) with the tradition of Georgian choir singer, and possibly you will accept the difficulties of your own existence and feel good after watching :) What I really like about this movie is that the actors in the non-leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are as interesting and important as the central character. The movie stars Vahtang Kikabidze (which is great), but you will remember every face around him in the movie. You will find yourself citing your lines, which have become household names for many Russian-speaking people. A movie to live. Simple but deep, you'll want to watch it again and again.
