If you had drama in your life, whether yours or someone close to you, the stages of pain that this woman (but, in my opinion, could easily have been a man too) pass are very real. It's a movie about not being able to deal with your pain, about not knowing what to do to help yourself get through it. Obviously, it's also a movie about not knowing how to help someone close to overcome their pain. It's a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It's a movie that can push someone to the limit ... which hardly sounds like a recommendation. I'm not sure if I would recommend anyone to see this movie, especially someone close, but for me ... it's a movie that puts things in perspective, which shows a real pain and therefore is very relevant to being alive. It makes you realize that, hey, you or the person next to you has lived the pain, that, hey, all the things that you care about now are of so little importance.
