Spoilers! Classic 70's Sex Trash! Swedish gal (Helga) was what made this movie so good. She was beautiful, but what really caught my attention was how much she was sexual. It exuded massive amounts of sexuality throughout the film. Her best scenes were when she was being stimulated. Whenever she was on the screen, I would be paralyzed. <br /> <br /> In addition, Dr. Julia (sister of the boring male focus of the film) was very interesting visually. Although most 12-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to wear what little she had and her scenes (especially the scenes in the silk blouse and black skirt) also caught my attention tirelessly. You also have to love the main scene where bats undress your nekkid; I do not know if I've ever seen anything more ridiculous but sexy at the same time. Classic things!
