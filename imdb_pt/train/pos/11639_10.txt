I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight. I just loved it. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is extremely scary as the villain. For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, your character has been a lot scarier in this movie. He played his character very well. The most scary "villain" I have seen in a while. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and clapped at the same time, as if we were on time. Suspense is performed through the film. The surprising part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the movie justice. The film is much better than the indicated trailer. Do not expect this movie to come out on video. Go see that. Although, I did not have to pay to see this movie, I would be happy to give 10.75 to see it. Appreciate!
