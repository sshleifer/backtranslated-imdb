I was 16 when I first saw the movie, and it was always one of my favorites. Of course, you can not deny Kristofferson's appeal in the film - HOW FINE IS THAT THE MAN ???????????? Sheesh He still is. He's the bad boy every woman wants secretly. His acting is impeccable. He played a drunk / drugged just the way someone who had actually passed could - and he had - in 76 he finally got in the car, so it was all very real. <br /> <br /> The music is EXCELLENT, and although I later felt that Streisand was not the right person for him in a sense of physical beauty, I think it's more of a problem for male viewers than for women. We girls are just looking at Kris - and of course the guys are looking at the female interest - my husband can not watch the movie for her - he does not like her appearance. But I made him sit just in the red Ferrari scene on the road until the end, so he could see how okay it was - the camera job was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music exploding - you should have I've seen it on my 50 "plasma - WOW !!!! And finally the transfer quality was great - widescreen anamorphic and very clear with colors and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all movies. <br /> <br /> I brought back some great memories of my mother and I loving this movie together, I bought her a copy for Christmas. <br /> <br /> I would have loved to have watched you along with her last night <br /> <br /> I tried to accompany the original with Judy Garland, but I think I see that first, I can not go into the previous era. Watching all the footage from the show in the 76 version was very much like what I was living in I'm working with Streisand's comment, but she She's just talking about herself and about them. So far, she barely mentioned Kris or details about scenes from the movie. Your voice seems EXACTLY the same now. <br /> <br /> Take a look, if you grew up around the same time as I (born in 1960), you'll love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
