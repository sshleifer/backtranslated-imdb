Many people like this movie and love it, but it seems like it's all for the wrong reasons. Scarface must be loved and loved, but not in the way it has been or is. <br /> <br /> Many people say that acting was exaggerated, but who better to make an exaggerated character than Al Pacino. To say that Pacino was exaggerated here would be a euphemism. However, he does it so well, he just brings the demon inside you as well. His character Tony Montana was not such a good guy to start with, but his thirst for power only brings his greed to another level; an inhumane level. Of course sometimes Pacino seems to be a bit caricatured and surreal, but that does not seem to me to be a liability at all. The support cast served his work very well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really at her best, but she certainly fit the part she played. On the other hand Steven Bauer was at his best, still is Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and Michelle Pfeiffer fit very well into her role. Robert Loggia I always enjoyed watching at just watch him scream. Unlike Pacino, they were not really standout or memorable performances. Everyone just seemed to fit into their roles for being there. They did not fit perfectly, but they were convincing enough. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma did a great job directing this movie. Whenever an actor is able to become greater than life with his performance, some credit should be given to the director and I will certainly give the De Palma that. Brian De Palma, although not respected, is a very versatile director of my account. He knows how to direct movies according to their genres, but sometimes it does not turn out well. Here, this is a gangster movie, but few are much better than this because of De Palma. <br /> <br /> The writing was great, it was just Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone had written this, I was not at all surprised. That's a testament to him though. I always thought of him as a great writer and for me he proves this once again with Scarface. No one knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> The music was good, but not so good. Certainly not my favorite of Giorgio Moroder. The music was a little 80s-ish for me, but it did not bother me. The cinematography was good, it was not amazing, but really who cares about a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This was probably one of the most influential films in the last 25 years, but as mentioned before, it's for the wrong reasons. . People should realize that Tony Montana's character is not a hero, he's a monster. He is not inspiring in any way. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated, and self-consuming. However, he is a role model for many people because he is somehow a rebel, but probably most of all, because he is a delusional criminal. A watcher would be like Mother Teresa next to Scarface. <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie is that it shows that the Tony Montanas are not the real problem. If we or the people of authority want to close people like him, we could do it, but we do not. In a strangely distorted way, it is a necessity of our society. He is someone in whom you can blame everything and feel better about yourself. The Tony Montanas of this world are the scapegoats of our society. This in no way excuses people like him. Instead, it's yet another reminder that we should not apologize or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure or think we are more up to par than a gangster or drug dealer. I love this movie because it is more than a corruption film, it is a movie that in a strange way makes you reflect.
