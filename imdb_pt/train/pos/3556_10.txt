Oh, this is such a glorious musical. There is a bit of confusion - Frank Sinatra is a miscast√≠ssimo like the Jew Nathan Detroit, although only becomes evident in "Sue Me", that is a distinctly Jewish music. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut one of the show's best songs, "Marry the Man Today," and replaced it with a smaller piece of Sinatra. With these two flaws in mind, the film is magnificent. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando does not know how to sing valuable beans, but takes it anyway. Stubby Kaye wonderfully reprises his Broadway role (it was written for him). The language, the rhythm and the mood of Damon Runyon pass very well. This is on my list of see-all-that-I-get.
