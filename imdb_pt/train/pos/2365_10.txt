Jeff Wincott is not just a Hunk, he can kick ass! This movie has some of the best martial arts moves I've seen in a long time. Okay, so maybe Bridgette Nielson is not the first person I would hire to play a ruthless politician, she did a great job, though! And let's not forget that Wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expert / stuntwoman Karen Sheperd. So she's not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares ?! She is so good, if not better! (just check out his fight scene at the end of the movie, one word: OUCH !!). My suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you did not see it, you're really missing out on some great martial arts action.
