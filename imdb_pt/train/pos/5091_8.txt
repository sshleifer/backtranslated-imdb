I watched both parts twice. He enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very believable as the hunter Alan Quartermaine and certainly surpassed the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I admit I would have preferred to see someone else as the "Lady in Peril". Alison Doody should keep up with modern, non-periodic parts. She did not look like the woman of 1800. The rest of the cast was fantastic and followed the plots very well. I'm happy to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to experiment with different characters and are not afraid of being seen as aged. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide it. A man over 50 can be a lot sexier (and, Patrick really is sexy), so a young green, no matter how beautiful. Hoorah for character lines to go along with a big smile.
