Another comedy about a small, brave country that traverses the jungle of the moderns (for the 1940s) of the global world, with only native intelligence and the courage to guide them, is a beautiful entry into the Ealing cannon. Terry-Thomas shines as usual in the lead, as a man of irresponsible ministry has led to the brink of disaster when a nation he is supposedly responsible begins to attract the world's interest, Ian Bannen makes a great romantic lead, Peter Sellers puts in a from his quieter performances as a corrupt politician and the uber-soft John Le Mesurier plays against the guy as a robust revolutionary leader. Lots of fun is for everyone, especially the viewer; perhaps not in the highest echelon of the classics of Ealing, but very high.
