As another IMDB reviewer remarked, this movie starts a little slow, but gets considerably better as it progresses. Yes, it is released by Roger Corman, but rather reviews some of the same thematic foundations of much larger budget predecessors, such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the juxtaposition of the wife's career as a rising blues singer against her husband's collective solitude and her quasi-Freudian need to fill the emotional and physical "void" or "hole" while she is away together with the clever use of effects and minimal settings is well done. Using a very small number of locations and characters, and also using water in almost every scene, as a metaphorical symbol of cleansing and drowning, this film, while clearly suffering from a tiny budget, reminds me in many ways of what scenery more recent, ie the French film "SWIMMING POOL", it seems to me, at least, may have liberally lent some useful ideas of "UP AGAINST AMANDA". With a smaller set of tools, UP AGAINST AMANDA maintains its suspense with a rudimentary and fatalistic vision of surrendering to the occasional lascivious temptations, but does it as well or better as the other films of that genre. The twist of Amanda's stepfather abuse in the past (again, very Freudian) is also very original in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and friendly reaction to Amanda's situation that this aspect of the story raises. The cast is excellent, I think. <br /> <br />
