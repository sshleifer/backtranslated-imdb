It's hard to judge movies like this, why do you rate this in production or just in fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this movie around 1988/89, more or less, when I was a kid and I'm sorry to say you started a lifelong fascination with ninjas. The plot is quite ghastly and the acting is obviously terrible, but there is a certain mystique around the ninjas in this film, which contributes to a pretty good atmosphere. What is important are the fight scenes, while a 'small' sparce, is really good. I must say it was best when I was a boy, only now I can see the glaring points of the unbelievable absurdity in the movie, but as a "sit down with a few beers" martial arts movie I can not fault it, it offers and is much better than the mountains of "American Ninja" style junk that was hectic in the 80's with hundreds of black suits guys, but really not very good fight scenes. On an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers made another ninja movie under the banner of the Bonaire movie called "White Phantom". I have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to Sakura Killers, "but the Sakura clan is once again a main feature, including the same logo and similar story only this time including a White Ninja. It had a small sense of atmosphere but the fighting scenes are even more sparse and to tell you the truth, they're pretty awful. So, if you're a martial arts fan, then blow it up to kill a few hours!
