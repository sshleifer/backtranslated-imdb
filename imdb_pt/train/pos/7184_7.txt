I absolutely love this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode, I could see why people were off at the beginning. The mood of the first episode is not the best, and they struggle to start the series properly. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become really nice characters. As the first episode, it does not exactly represent the rest of the show, which is actually quite good. The episode is not bad at all, but as the show progresses, it gets better and better, so watch more episodes before you pass judgment on the quality of the show.
