War is hell. But this World War II documentary is paradise. <br /> <br /> This series is not only a breathtaking, almost exhausting vision of World War II, it is a poetic masterpiece narrated in a clear and superb manner by Laurence Olivier. /> <br /> This documentary series defines the genre. It is very long, no doubt, but you will like all of them and want to come back for more and more. (I have the series on DVD and I probably watch the series three times a year). <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a flawless piece of making movies. In addition to Olivier, the best part of the series is to hear the veterans tell their stories; be it about a real battle or about finding a butcher's pig so they could have something delicious for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'll watch now (again, my ... 11th time).
