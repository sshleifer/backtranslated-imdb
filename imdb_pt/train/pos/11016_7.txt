Good show action, but nothing new. This one took place high in the mountains, which showed a nice scenery and such. A man takes a bunch of mercenaries, the lead flies and he kicks his butt. It could have been called "Rambo Goes to the Rockies", it was that pat. He had a very effective scene right in the first film that made me cringe in horror. It's not a bad image, but just the same ol ', even ol'.
