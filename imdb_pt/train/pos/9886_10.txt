This is a beautiful movie visually. The pictures of the Mexican desert, the old mansion, the characters in their picturesque costumes ... all this is a true work of art. <br /> <br /> The story seems a little loose, but that's because it does not mean to be realistic. It is taken from a book called One Hundred Years of Solitude, and is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated and supernatural atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States." The tremendous debt that Erendira owes to his grandmother symbolizes the weight of Latin America's international debt, although there are many layers of meaning. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a slow-textured film with a rich texture, this is for you.
