The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian films because of the lack of quality and imagination of filmmakers. In addition to Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out. CCCC had a lot of contraversion due to the financing of the film and this without really knowing what it was about the film generated good publicity and advanced the sale of tickets for the film in India and Abroad. The only information given was that it was a thriller of suspense. The film was released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly good. The main plot has to do with subrogation and is well treated. Salman and Preiti give a good performance where Salman does not really take off the shirt at all ... they must be special effects !! Rani plays Salman's wife, but is a somewhat less demanding role compared to Preiti, who plays Prostituta, who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The top three leaders confirm that after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they have a solid on-screen appearance and off-screen chemistry (apparently). Salman Khan, who is excellent, plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and it is a shame to be exploited as an aspiring comedian in his other films as he is greatly underestimated in the Mumbai film industry, partly due to the movies he chooses. The character of Rani does not know that Preiti is a prostitute until the end ... this is maintained by her and the rest of the family ... the rest you must find out, because that will ruin the movie if I tell you. The songs are all well portrayed, especially dekhne walon and the main title music. The other supporting actors make a minimal effort, but very well, like Salmans, loving the family. Abbas Mastan produced a success and dealt with the subject of the film tactfully .. I say, go and watch or rent what you prefer!
