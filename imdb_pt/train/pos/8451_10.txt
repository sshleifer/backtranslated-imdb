How I started: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I have to say I've never seen anything like it, and it was the best. But when I started collecting the series on VHS, and years later on DVD, part of the Bandai Anime Legends collections. It was amazing and really worth watching. He had a lot of exploding action that will get you out of his place. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters on the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin. and Zechs. My favorite Gundams on the show I liked most were Wing Zero, Epyon and, of course, Altron, Deathscythe I and II. Meaning of the show: What this series also tells us that in real life , wars are very difficult and sometimes we can win or lose, but peace can also be difficult to obtain, and I believe Gundam pilots are doing the right thing, and are trying to achieve world peace. But, this show is really the best of the best. So, by closing this review, after watching this show, watch the movie Endless Waltz.
