I took the film without a cover and did not even know what it was, but when I watched it I laughed so much. Now it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Rusty and the guys have created a masterpiece. I recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Thank you Rusty for giving us something to laugh about.
