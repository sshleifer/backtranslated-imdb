"Shore Leave" is primarily an average Star Trek adventure. Nothing wrong with the episode, though. I simply think this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer fans. It's light and fun, nothing more. However, I'm glad to see that such a TV show had enough sense to take time in serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to grant his crew some time off, and a landing party is transmitted to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems to be. There are a few moments of action and tense, but most of the story is played for laughter. Good, but not exceptional.
