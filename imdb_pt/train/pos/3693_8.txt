It's not easy to make a movie with 18 different stories. Although 18 different international directors have taken up the challenge, not all are good, some even boring. But in his entity, "Paris, je t'aime" is breathtaking, showing that, as "Love Actually" puts it, "love is everywhere," especially in the city of love. Here is a summary (I'll try to make the most free spoiler possible) of the 18 different stories. <br /> <br /> MONTMARTRE - sort of a dull opening sequence, nothing really special about it. A man finds a parking spot and sees many weird couples walking, wondering why he can not find a girl. And suddenly a woman collapses next to her car ... WHAT ABOUT SEINE - another dull sequence, about three teenage boys who are looking for a piece of tail, when suddenly a Muslim A girl stumbles right in front of them, getting help from one of the boys. Really basic, but with a sweet heart for it. <br /> <br /> LES MARAIS - this was a big disappointment! Although a love story between two boys with an artistic background might have been interesting by the great Van Sant. Eventually, everything that comes AFTER Ulliel's monologue is good, everything before is just annoying. <br /> <br /> TUILERIAS - an amusing sequence of the Coen brothers. Buscemi - without even saying a word - is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is hilarious. This kept me hooked until the end, and this also gets you really addicted to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - a beautiful story too, even if execution is bad, the heart is there. It's the story of a Hispanic woman leaving her son early in the morning to take care of another suburban baby. Beautiful. CHOISY PORTE - this segment has to be the strangest and strangest of the whole movie. Some kind of shampoo salesman comes in a place similar to Chinatown in Paris. If I understood correctly, the story is about inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - a truly wonderful sequence. A man meets his wife at a restaurant, to finish with her, so that he can run away with his lover. But the wife has some devastating news. Pretty basic, but really sad and cute! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence too. Juliette Binoche plays a bereaved mother. One night, she wakes up listening to her dead son. When she arrives at the scene, a cowboy says she can give her son one last goodbye. One of the best segments! EIFFEL TOUR - two mimos that fell in love could have been great, but despite having some cool cinematic tricks, the story is not intriguing and not funny at all. <br /> PARQUE MONCEAU - a true original and great sequel, one of the best in the movie! A young woman and an older man discuss their future and their fear for a certain man ... Cuaron does a great job of directing, and the actors are incredible! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - An American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. a nice segment of new, with a very sad ending PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man, he starts talking about romantic with her ... because she is the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins, who are looking for new emotions in their relationship ... very bland and without romanticism, Pigalle is a let down. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing some diversity in the film, the QdlM is a relief. A young guy (Wood) meets a vampire killing a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love! Dark, scary and strangely romantic, Madeleine is superb. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another disappointing segment. Directed by Wes Craven and stars like Mortimer and Sewell, it could have been great, but Père-Lachaise is simply ordinary, nothing original. FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - rumors are TRUE, Twyker's short film is beautiful, stunning and well done. A blind man picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend (Portman - truly impressive) that she ends up with him. It reflects on your relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this segment has been co-directed by Depardieu and has stars like Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also a disappointment. Nothing happens, lack of chemistry between the actors. <br /> <br /> 14th ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time. An American speaks in her French class about her trip to Paris. Her French is really terrible, but at the end of the segment, she realizes that Paris is so much more than she looks. With Feist in the background, "Paris, je t'aime" ends in a sweet tone, not disappointing, although some segments annoy me, the entity of the film is great! A true cinematic experience for young and old. Paris, je t'aime vraiment!
