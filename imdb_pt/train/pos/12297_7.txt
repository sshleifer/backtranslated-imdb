Anna Christie (1931) On her own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, filmed a year later in German with a brand new cast, is only attenuated and refined enough to work better than English. version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is, if it is something more authoritarian (or more beautiful as a presence on the screen) and his acting is more restrained. And she seems frankly more at ease, probably for several reasons, but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first spoken image, so she adjusted quickly. <br /> <br /> Without ever comparing one movie with another. another, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill play with many words. Her themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here, but it seems oddly old-fashioned anyway. There are some missing scenes - the Coney Island section is shortened and not so good - but overall it's a direct echo of the first movie. The director, Jacques Feyder (Franco-Belgian-French), is simply redoing what has already been done, which I assume to be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see the two films in succession, because they are locked in exactly the same way (not just the sets, but the photos are all the same). There is an occasional scene from the previous movie - part of the storm, understandably, but also a brief scene in which Marie Dressler is walking with her friend on a board over a canal, drunk as it can be. . But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is no substitute for Dressler, of course, but to me the German father is more believable and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> Clearly the themes - immigration, disobedient parents, daughters turning to prostitution and problems. to find true love - has strong currents at the time, especially with European wires (Garbo appropriately plays a Swedish girl).
