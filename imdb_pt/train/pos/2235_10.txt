I really liked this movie because it is a true story set in the Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe a condensed form of the book was published in Reader's Digest shortly after the event occurred. <br /> <br /> Because I'm a baby boomer, the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and for that reason I've related to the movie. I also believe the film is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer observes the character following the streams that lead to the river and coastal settlements where she can get help as well as other survival techniques. Most important was his willingness to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope that viewers will learn something about this in addition to seeing it for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like the movie to be released on VHS and DVD so I would like to add it to my video collection. . It should also be shown more often on satellite movie channels.
