Telemundo should definitely consider making a DVD collection of the novel Xica! I know thousands of people, including myself, who would like to be able to buy the novel Xica! It is a very fun novel that is happening in Brazil. The costumes used by the actors are beautiful and the city where the soap opera takes place is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history from that time period. I wanted Telemundo to re-watch it even if it was a 2 in the morning. I recommend watching Xica if he is shown again on Telemundo. I sent an email to Telemundo a million times to show the novel again, but my requests fell on deaf ears. The only statement of caution about Xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes, so I would recommend that children under the age of 14 do not watch Xica. Overall, Xica deserves 10 out of 10!
