Does anyone find it interesting that the Ood looks strangely like the "Great Cthulhu" of the H P Lovecraft crop? hmmm <br /> <br /> Great couple of episodes (not referring to Billie Piper as most seem to do!) in The Impossible Planet and The Well of Satan. <br /> <br /> Also the link to 'Legion' I also thought used in Who before and also referring to Satan in several post-Exorcist novels ... <br /> <br /> Great suspense episodes using elements of fear and faith. The new team for these 'who's working a great magic for the TV. <br /> <br /> This certainly creates new fears and 'hides behind the couch' feelings not seen by many, many years in this sequel to an excellent BBC series. (sorry it is confirmed by the BBC that Billie Piper is giving up - perhaps not permanently - after the end of series 2): O (((
