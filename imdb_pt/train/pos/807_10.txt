Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between the Rebellion and the Empire. The Second Death Star is in its completion phase and when it is completed, it will mean the end of the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the Shield generator attack on the forest moon of Endor, while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. Little do they know that a very ingenious trap was laid for them and Emperor Palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the Second Death Star. <br /> <br /> The return of the Jedi is my favorite of the original trilogy. It has action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, incredible fighting scenes and incredible music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is fully matured now in a Jedi Knight, gone is the naive farm boy and in his stead is a calm and relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Read is still cool in this movie, as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie play their roles in a T, while James Earl Jones is still the biggest movie villain: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain as the evil and brutally emperor Palpatine. The action sequences of this film are incredibly surprising and the sword fights are serious and courageous. The score of John Williams is still cool and enhances the movie on several levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
