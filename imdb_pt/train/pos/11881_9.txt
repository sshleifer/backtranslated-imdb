Every great gangster movie has sub-streams of human drama. Do not expect an emotional story of "Scarface" guilt, retribution, and despair. This is a tale of fierce greed, corruption and power. The darker side of the fabulous "American Dream". <br /> <br /> Someone who complains about the "tackiness" of this movie is missing the point. The superficial characters, kitschy music, and dated fashion further fuel the critique of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matters, not on any human level, at least. In fact, the film practically limits the satire, ironic considering all the gangsters who were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. <br /> <br /> This is not Brian DePalma's greatest management effort, it is occasionally excellent and successful. manipulated (particularly the memorable ending), but often sinks sloppy and cheated. Fortunately, he is backed by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the cocaine habit he was facing at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, oscillating comfortably between humor and drama. There are many prominent lines, which have since infiltrated popular culture in one form or another. <br /> <br /> The cast also helps make it what it is, but this is really the Pacino movie. One of his earliest less subtle performances (something much more common nowadays), this is a totally separate world of Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. However, it is as much watched here as ever, in a very entertaining (and intentionally exaggerated) way. It's hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this movie, possibly one of the most imitated performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable at first viewing, but I came to realize how she plays the role of bored little wife. It is not an exceptional effort, but unjustly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the soft Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking and continually controversial. "Scarface" is one of the eighties films (whatever it may mean to you). An essential and affordable gangster film and a landmark of pop culture. 9/10
