Stage adaptations often have a serious flaw. They often come out looking like a movie camera was simply put on the stage (like "Night Mother"). The direction of Sidney Lumet keeps the film alive, which is especially difficult, since the photo does not offer him any real challenge. Still, it's good to look at what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is amazing. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve has one of his few chances to actually take action. <br /> <br /> I confess I have never seen Ira Levin's play, but I have heard that Jay Presson Allen's adaptation is faithful. The script is incredibly complicated and keeps you guessing. "Deathtrap" is an extremely entertaining film, and is recommended for almost every stage and screen fan. <br /> <br /> 7.4 of 10
