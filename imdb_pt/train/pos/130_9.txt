In October 1945, German American descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in post-war Frankfurt and his bitter Uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job for him on the Zentropa train line as a sleeping car driver . . While traveling on the train by learning his profession, he sees the destroyed occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of Zentropa's former powerful business entrepreneur and owner Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between Allied and German forces, and realizes that there is a terrorist group called "Werewolves" killing Allied sympathizers and conducting subversive actions against allied forces. He falls in love with Katharina, and earlier she reveals that she was a "werewolf." When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also pressured by the "Werewolves" and needs to take a stand and a decision. <br /> <br /> "Europe" is an impressive and distressing story of Kafkanian from the great Danish director Lars von Trier. . Using an Expressionist style reminiscent of Fritz Lang and alternating a magnificent black and white cinematography with some colorful details, this film reveals a difficult period in Germany and some of the problems that this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war. Very impressive is the action of the occupation forces that destroy resources that could allow a more rapid reconstruction of a destroyed country, and the corruption with the Jew that should identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr performs impressively in the role of the man who wants to remain neutral , but is manipulated everywhere by all. The hypnotic narration of Max Von Sydow is another touch of class in this award-winning film. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europe"
