I only saw this show a few times, but it will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It's so frustrating that it's so hard to find this anywhere to buy and yet there seem to be endless repetitions of things like Friends! Especially harder to be able to be in England, I guess ..? <br /> <br /> Do they say it was a low hearing or was it a complaint from PD Bakersfield himself? Maybe it was very smart for certain people? <br /> <br /> Anyway, just about the comedy I'd love to see again, but it's almost impossible to find. Did I hear it being or was it repeated on another network? But unfortunately it is not here !! <br /> <br /> Summary: Ingenious.
