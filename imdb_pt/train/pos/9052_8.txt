This is a great drama and a nice change of pace from the hectic and noisy movies of today. It is another solid store based on a true one, which still means that much of what could be done for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I do not know, but I liked the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young man in the fifties who is interested in rockets and wants to go into that field instead of working in the coal mines. as everyone, including his father, does in this city of West Virginia. The big problem is the conflict between the boy and the father, which I think was exaggerated. I wish I had a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his early works, I think. He's nice, just like his classmates here. It's good to see cool kids in a modern movie. The other two main actors in the film are Chris Cooper (the father) and Laura Dern (the boy's teacher who encourages him all the time). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is decent that the 50's soundtrack is fun to hear. Once again: I would like more such films to be made today.
