Goldeneye will always be one of the most legendary games in VG's history. There is no doubt about it. But this game, although very different, could be the current Bond champion of his time. <br /> <br /> This was not a bonus game based on other media material. This was completely new; script game. That still had its own theme song! (It would not be a bond without it, haha!) The gameplay was great, and if you're a fan of the bonus games or movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / more games, these cast members portrayed their characters, unlike the fictional creations of the game. Which gives that most cinematic sensation. With a very capable storyline, you feel you're in the game as much as you lose in a movie. <br /> <br /> Nice in every way, from start to finish. Even after winning the game there is still much more to be done. With the unlocking and sorting system to be achieved, as well as their multi-player missions, this is a featured game. In spite of being quite old now, in the years of video games. It is still a good game that you can pick up and play whenever you feel the need to earn a little more Bond in your life. Even now, just thinking about it, I have the theme song stuck in my head. Such a great cast and well written plot. <br /> <br /> The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of it, and is as fun as the game itself. Superbly done, in true connection form. That can only be called Awesome, Completely Awesome. <br /> <br /> I have to play this game now. If you have not played yet, you're missing out!
