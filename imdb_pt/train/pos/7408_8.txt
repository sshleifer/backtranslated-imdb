I had the privilege of seeing this movie at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Ducha' is a $ 200,000 movie about a father and his 2 children. The father has a traditional resort somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local men, mostly elderly, come to relax and take a shower. The father has children: a 'retarded' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a great modern city and who comes to visit him. For this son, the traditional village, the bathhouse and his 'retarded' brother seem strange and annoying, but that changes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Although the story may sound tacky or clich√©, it is not. With really great performances, especially from the father and the 'retarded' son (sorry, I do not know their names) and a great story that the movie played and it was funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie do this. It's a great alternative to conventional Hollywood movies. <br /> <br />
