Solino really thrilled me with his deeply drawn characters. Although it was a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply hatred or jealousy. What I liked best about the film was how I could identify with the feelings that Gigi was going through, especially when he had to take his mother back to his native city in Italy and not attend the awards ceremony of the film in which his movie was performed. Seeing this character who fought so much between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even in the end, when he makes one more attempt to reach his father he was so brave. And like in real life, most parents never get beyond their walls to reach their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who despite being the safest and oldest brother, had so many insecurities. A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.
