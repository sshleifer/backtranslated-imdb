As an old rocker, this movie mentions Heep and Quo - my two favorite bands of all time - but with the incredible cast (all) - and the fantastic story - I love this creative genius. I can not recommend it more - and Mick Jones added a lot (foreign leader and lead songwriter along with the greatest rock singer of all time - Lou Gramm) - I watched that great job more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - who voice - and Jimmy Nail - talent emanates from every pore - so Astrid ... and Karen ... what else an old rocker could ask !! 10/10 - bloody brilliant. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
