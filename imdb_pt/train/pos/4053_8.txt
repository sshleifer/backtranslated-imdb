I remember liking Nausicaa more than the valley of the winds at a time when this tone of history was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title seems to have affected his US release to avoid confusion for his vast Hispanic audience, has the caricature of director Conan's debut production. In fact, Pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of Conan - who jumped a thousand stories carrying the girl in his arms and fell to his feet, then began to run. This makes him the most lively and enjoyable character to watch. Nausica technology fans may be disappointed with bugs and retro technology through Laputa - the only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the theme in Laputa is not directly linked to environmentalism. If you have a theme, it's anti-war. The importance of living naturally - this is related to the flying castle, is discussed in an unreasonable way and is not really followed. Overall, I now consider the piece to be an intersection between feeling good and tacky.
