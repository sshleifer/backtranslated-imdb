This 1939 film tried to capitalize on Michael Curtiz's much better film, "Angels with Dirty Faces." As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how these children tamed in comparison to what is happening to the youth in America's cities today. <br /> <br /> The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed that they were well together. The Dead End kids have bigger parts as the plot focuses on them, not the older ones. <br /> <br /> In a way, it is curious how the fire was used in the same way that some scrupulous masters did in recent years here. In New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around never to consider the social problems it created. In the current climate, with so many weapons around, there is a new reality. The young men of history seemed mere playboys, not criminals. How times change!
