I was prepared for a travel book, but I was content to find a quick script, an underlying moral, excellent portraits of all the actors, especially Peter Finch, incredible special effects, suspense and beautiful cinematography - there is even a shot of the majestic Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor in her most glorious beauty and sympathy, before she gave in to the gaseous hysteria that marked her later work. All the support players complete, and I wonder who trained all those elephants. Talking about the Stone Buddha's sequel, you really can discern that it is Vivien Leigh in the longest plans. Its shape and the way it moves is different from Taylor's. The only thing that spoils this sequence are the poorly made process takes, in which the background moves very fast for the horses on a hike. <br /> <br /> If you want a thought-provoking movie that is cute to watch and never annoying, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.
