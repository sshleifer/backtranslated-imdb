This movie is so much fun. The actors really make the movie go away. Without revealing the plot, I would describe it as a new favorite cult of the brides princess, who should stand the test of time. You can see a completely different side of Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth the admission price just for this!) All elements are there from adventure to romance and well-positioned comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will have fun. (My parents even did!) Good special effects can be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for a bit of escapism. <br /> <br /> Deserves an A. (I hope it's good at the box office)
