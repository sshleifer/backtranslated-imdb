Looking back over the last 28 years (from my first exposure to the show), all I can say is: once you get it, it will stay with you forever. I remember my initial reaction being: 1) annoyingly exaggerated, 2) under production 3) unpleasant characters <br /> <br /> Well, two years later I watched a few episodes again and did not find it so annoying. A year later, I was able to capture the entire series from the beginning and quickly became involved in its bittersweet history of human failings and prospects of happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the value of the production would be difficult to deal with now. But I still think of the program at least once a month with a vague and hurt look at what seemed to be a simpler moment ... <br /> <br /> BTW I'm a married man ... (for everyone who think this is a show for women)
