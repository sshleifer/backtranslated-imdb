Burlinson and Thornton performed very well in this film, along with Dennehy. Although initially thought only about love, it really is deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this movie, putting it among one of the best I have ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic !! All horse lovers will love this movie! <br /> <br />
