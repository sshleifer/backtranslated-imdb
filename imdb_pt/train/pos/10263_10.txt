"House of Games" is a perfectly constructed movie, and one of the few movies I saw left me gaping at the screen, amazed at how smartly and unexpectedly it ends. I first saw the video for a few years after reading Roger Ebert's review of the best film of 1987. I had my doubts, mainly because it is not as well known as the other films of that year. Boy, I was in for a surprise. This was one of the most intelligent and well written films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is a good job, not just in terms of plot (which spins and turns and pulls the rug out of you only when you think you have it all planned) but also in terms of development of character. On my second screening, I began to realize that Mamet's script is not just a clever thriller, but that the development of each plot contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. The film's climax is particularly effective because it is absolutely unavoidable. This stems naturally from what we know about the characters and therefore is much more than just an arbitrary ending. The performances of Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also contribute enormously to the film. I can not imagine any other actor besides Mantegna playing Mike, and Crouse plays his part with the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mentality. His work, in addition to the extraordinary screenplay of Mamet, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 80's. It truly is a must.
