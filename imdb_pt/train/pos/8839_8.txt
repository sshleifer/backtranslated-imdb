Thank God this was not based on a true story, because it is a story. Filled with despicable characters whose depravity knows no boundaries, Before The Devil is a fascinating excursion to fall into what is laughable (and sometimes it is, even with - or perhaps because of - the psychologically tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction) was not carried out with a conviction so magnificent and overwhelming by its stars. Kelly Masterson's excellent script and superb direction from none other than Sidney Lumet does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two mostly injured brothers (brilliant portraits of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) decide to rob their parents' jewelry store, an attempt that is pathetically wrong . <br /> <br /> The story is told with time shifts (which are noted on the screen, such as: "Charlie: two days before theft", so no one should get confused); some people said they did not like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly, increasing the size of the subject, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with complete decks - among them you could not make a decent one. poker hand to save your life. Add these extravagant junkies: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, has a monumental rivalry between siblings, along with the fact that A on drugs he hates his father (a violent performance by Albert Finney), which apparently has caused him severe pain in the past, and you have a Greek / Shakespearean tragedy in your hands. Proceed with caution.
