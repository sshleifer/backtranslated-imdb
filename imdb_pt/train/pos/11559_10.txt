The strange couple is a comic gem. One of the funniest scripts ever made for the celluloid - beaten only by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: the obsessive compulsive Felix and the sloppy and irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because he is impossible to live because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the beginning of the movie, and after a frustrated suicide attempt he switches to his friend Oscar. That's when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire script is brilliant and full of brilliant one-liners. You are probably already familiar with "F.U." joke, but still works brilliantly due to Matthau's comic timing. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clean his breast at the diner and when the Pigeon sisters are being enchanted by a very soft Matthau and Lemmon is totally out of his element. This requires repeated views!
