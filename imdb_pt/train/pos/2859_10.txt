I know this sounds strange coming from someone born almost 15 years after the show stops airing, but I love this show. I do not know why, but I like watching. I love Adam the best. The only disappointing thing is that the only place I found to buy the DVD seasons was in Germany, and it was only the first two seasons. This is disappointing, but okay. I'll keep looking online. If anyone has any tips on where to buy the second through Season 14, send an email to darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already own the first one. The only bad side is that DVDs are from Germany, they only play on my portable DVD player and on my computer. Oh well. I still have it!
