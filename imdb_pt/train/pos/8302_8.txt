Weapons exploding, buildings exploding, cars falling, and it's only the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This action-packed movie involving a former ex-CIA mercenary who can not die no matter how many times he is shot (hence the title) is pretty decent. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, hard and full of teeth, usually cast as a villain in these types of movies, has his usual charm, but is a little weaker: after all, he carries the whole show. This does not mean that there are not many supporting roles, including William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson, R.G. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Kirkpatrick Lincoln, Thalmus Rasulala and several other "forgotten" character actors. There are enough action sequences to support the whole story: Busey has to free a group of "kidnapped" American military elites and return a high-tech supertank (a normal tank with an addiction - top) back to the States. <br /> <br /> But does America deserve this killing machine more than the bad guys? This question is made, of course, as in any film centered on the CIA ... but without becoming lazy.
