Once a year "comes" a movie like that and makes things easier for you. You do not try to think it's good, it's just is. You like this as you watch, and you take it home with you. I can not say it is totally flawless, but it is close. Performance - great, interesting-story and suspenseful elements. It's a small family story, quite predictable, but it's not the secret itself that matters. it's the way it takes the blind girl to reach her. I was struck by the way the director portrayed his deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like was the actress who played the mother, she was very hard and unnecessary. Keren
