I have to say, although I despise this kind of show, horror shock, I'm a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I had seen Dirty Sanchez before seeing Jackass and thinking that he overcame Jackass in terms of creating programs. Story lines and interviews are intertwined to create a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes of the Jackass movie the other night and could not believe how misplaced it was, all just putting a joke in line after the joke unrelated to anything. It must have been the easiest program to edit, shockingly amateur. While drinking vomit is not really my thing, as far as a substantial entertainment spectacle is concerned, Dirty Sanchez is out of the Jackass Championship.
