I was amazed by the improvements made in an animated film. If you sit near the screen, you will see the details on the grass and surface structures. The detail, color, and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than Toy Story. As they were able to take away the shading, I will never know. I hope PIXAR will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so that I can find out how this has all been accomplished. Based on this movie, I think the animated films of the future will be judged based on this movie.
