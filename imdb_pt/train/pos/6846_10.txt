The film gets my seal of approval. The scene in the museum requires acting without dialogue. This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in movie history. The character of Dickinson, Kate, is very well developed and his performance is felt throughout the film. The best job Angie Dickinson did from Point Blank!
