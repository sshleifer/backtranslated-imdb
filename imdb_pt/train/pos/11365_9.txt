Okay, let's start by saying that this movie is not an exact version of the crimes and legal persecution of Andrei Chikatilo. Although it may have been "official policy" in the Politburo that the USSR did not have serial killers, in fact the legal system had dealt with others, and "Killer X" (as he was called) was already being sought when Fetisov brought Burakov to The Case . In fact, as soon as he realized that they had several murders in their hands, the authorities appointed a task force of dozens of officers to track down and terminate the killing of a man who did not fit into what is considered a normal serial killer. parameters. It is good that the director and writers always remind the viewer that the story is only "based on actual events," for a docudrama that is not. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS FOLLOW **** <br/> <br /> That said, this is a good example of a fast-paced Hollywood-style thriller that still conveys the basics of what happened . It's easy to follow and has enough truth behind your version of the events to make an eye-catching preview. Yes, Chikatilo raped and killed children and adults, both men and women. Yes, poor lab work has set him free to continue killing for years. Yes, innocent men were accused of the murders and "confessed" to their crimes at the insistence of the police. Yes, the gay community was harassed while the crimes were being committed (though with the committed help of Burakov). And yes, Chikatilo was confessed not by the special prosecutor's speech, Gorbunov, but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (though Gorbunov was not at all close to the selfish martin portrayed in this film). Quibles about truth and truthfulness aside, all these events are dramatized in a way that consistently tightens tension and fear. <br /> <br /> Do not mess with director and co-writer Chris Gerolmo have a perfect cast. Stephen Rea's growing emotional involvement in the killings and the development of skill in detecting clues, Donald Sutherland's sarcastic manipulation of Soviet attacks that become apparent when necessary, Jeffrey DeMunn's furious current hidden by fearful behavior, Max Von Sydow's childish excitement at being part of a criminal investigation increases sharp dialogue and sharp editing in ways that can not be underestimated. <br /> <br /> Taken for what it is, "Citizen X" is almost perfect. "almost" due to a moment of self-congratulation in the end that just does not fit). Highly recommended as well-told fiction, not actually being presented ... but considering the junky serial killer movies that Hollywood usually spits on, that's good enough for me.
