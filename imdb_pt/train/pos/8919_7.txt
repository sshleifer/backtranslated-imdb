Who would think that Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) had a Steve McQueen movie in her past? But this is just one of several strange and wonderful things about the last teen movie of 1950, which can be described as Rebel Without a Cause, that God knows what comes from space. The Rebel is Steven McQueen (who would soon decide that "Steve" sounded less affectionate), a good boy with enough savage to be interesting; the very healthy and understanding girlfriend is the already mentioned Aneta Corsaut. It was bad enough when their encounter was interrupted by teenagers, but they are considerably more perplexed when they find a gelatinous, the man who moves the soil in its own meteor - and begins to swallow the inhabitants of the city. right and left. But will adults believe them? Of course not, what they know, they are just kids! <br /> <br /> The movie is tiny at its best bopping. The actors take the pretentious script seriously, with lots of soulful looks, and the cast of "adult" support probably says "Kids!" very third sentence or so. But the true pleasure of the film is his creature, who is well imagined, well executed, and often manages to generate a surprising degree of suspense. And while it's clearly on the cheap side (check out these miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is actually a pretty well made movie - and there's that little catchy theme song that was put to good measure. The audience of over 40 people (myself included) will like the movie as nostalgia, but that will not stop them from playing alongside the younger crowd in all the 1950s sensibility and white milk, and the film would be a great choice for a family movie night or for a more sophisticated "adult" gets together. Make plenty of gelatin cubes for movie snacks! Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
