Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacularly accomplished film, but it left a bitter taste in the mouth. Rob Roy, by contrast, is a little less polished, but by far a better movie. This is a historical film that combines timeless themes with truly historical values, while Braveheart puts a coarse and unpleasant contemporary glow in an old tale. What makes this movie is the cast. Liam Neeson plays the hero in a role he basically reprized (in a diluted form) in the Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but not the greatest fighter or the most demonic lover. Brave but human, he commands the screen. Against him is a selection of equally human opponents, including Tim Roth's Cunningham, detestable but brilliant, and the morally bankrupt laird of John Hurt. Also praised is Jessica Lange, as the pragmatic wife of Rob: also strong and noble, but to 300 years of a modern heroine, which is just as it should be. This is not the most original movie you'll see, but you have the courage of your own convictions, and the strong performances make you care.
