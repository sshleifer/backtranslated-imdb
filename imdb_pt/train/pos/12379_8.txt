I was a usherette at an old theater in Northern California when this movie came out. As good as it is on DVD, it's even stranger and scary on the big screen. Although it has been about 9 years since I've seen it, it's still one of my all time favorites. At the risk of sounding banal, "They just do not do it anymore!" If Sixth Sense scared you, this movie is definitely for you! Great plot, incredible cast of characters, sinister scenery; even the soundtrack has an astonishing quality. I recommend that you do not watch alone. What a sandstone apartment was renting only in 1977, will make you gasp (at least 10 times that price today).
