When I heard that Patrick Swayze was finally returning to acting with KING SOLOMON'S MINES, I was very excited. I was expecting a great Indiana Jones-type action adventure. What I got was a 4 hour epic (with commercials) which was very slow. The second and third hours might have been abandoned, and history would not have suffered. The ending was good (no spoilers here), but I was still wanting more. Well, everything a guy can do is stuck Swayze does "RoadHouse 2" so he can get back to the action genre that made him famous. Even if you are a fan of King Solomon's Mines than reading the book or watching the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone, which is also not very good, but his only hour and forty minutes of his life was instead of 4 hours.
