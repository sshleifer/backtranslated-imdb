I think this movie is the best about Mike Hammer, with the performance of Biff Elliott, the definitive Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's screenplay is excellent and contains many improvements in Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he makes good use of light and shadow. John Alton's camera work is top notch, as is Franz Waxman's score. The cast includes many veteran players as well as Peggie Castle in their memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have been given more opportunities. I've always cherished this movie.
