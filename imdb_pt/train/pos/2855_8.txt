A fun and noun movie, Non-Stop attracted deserving comparisons with "Run Lola Run." The film quickly evolves into a chase sequence, during which viewers learn about the three main characters through flashbacks and daydream sequences. The pursuit does not serve as an accelerated climax, but as a journey that makes up most of the film. During the "race," we see the characters grow up and momentarily forget about their dark lives, about the "macho" roles they bought and eventually forget why they started running in the first place. Just as the fight provided a "clarity" for the characters in "Fight Club," the race provides the characters in the movie with a way to get away from the false values ​​we all allow society to create for us. Your race serves as a way to truly savor life from a cloudless perspective, and all three find some level of clarity and joy in the process. My appreciation and pleasure only dimmed slightly at the end of the film where, instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to reverse the depiction of those false macho roles that I thought had escaped during their journey . <br /> <br /> Still, the only real problem with this movie is that it was not distributed out of Japan earlier.
