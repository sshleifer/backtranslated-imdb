This is a great show! I had a US history teacher in high school who was very much like this. There are many "facts" in the story that are not quite true and Mr. Wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl is teaching a class of film students, but students of history and even the general public will appreciate the ingenious way he reveals some well-known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them with the brains of their students. The use of live actors performing "skits" is also a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend this series to anyone interested in having the story they learned as a child turned upside down.
