Well, for starters, this was Clausen's most elegant film to date. <br /> <br /> Man always has a sense of humor for the characters, but I think he in this movie adds an unparalleled dimension to anything he has done previously. His work - in very black and white words - was accepted by the broad but not so critical audience, and we always appreciate his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say. In Villa Paranoia, however, for the first time, he surprises with an invisible wisdom and a respect for minorities. Not only the ethnic people but also the normal people that you are located in Jutland - in 'the country' - deals with the eternal issue of lack of love, but in a close and sometimes brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused.And above all, he himself can play drunk! **** d, you want the right thing, but you have no idea how to get there, and people therefore suffer. Bitterly. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's one of the best movies I've ever had I saw this year and I am very looking forward to his next one.
