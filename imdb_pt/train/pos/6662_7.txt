Gandhi My Father is a well made movie. It portrays the life of Gandhiji's eldest son Harilal very well. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to be on his own, his failure, his ego .. Akshaye Khanna fully justifies the role of Harilal. Just not him, everyone did well in the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji on the screen I have ever seen. But I'm going to cut three points because there were few flaws. <br /> <br /> First, the film lasted fifteen to twenty minutes longer than it should have. Second, the film needed more research on Harilal's character. Somewhere, the character seemed incomplete. In addition, his relationship with his siblings was not shown. There was no mention of any other Gandhiji child throughout the film. I believe that the character as Harilal should have at least some differences in his siblings as well, considering Harilal's selfish nature. <br /> <br /> Anyway, despite some shortcomings, I liked the movie.
