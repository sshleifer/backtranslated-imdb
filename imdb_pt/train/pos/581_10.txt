A River Runs Through It's one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated. The acting is wonderful and discreet, with all the gestures and smiles and nods that carry meaning. Brad Pitt gives a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as the preacher father. The movie moves like a river, you have to be willing to follow it through streams and ebbs, but it's worth it in the end.
