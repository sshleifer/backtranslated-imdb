I chose this movie based on the plot summary and quotes from the critics on the back of the box. I'm not big on foreign films and did not know what to expect. I do not really care for subtitles as well. But I just loved it! It has a simple and lovely quality that leaves you feeling good with life. I found myself laughing aloud repeatedly. I would recommend this photo to anyone, even to those who hate foreign films with subtitles. This is worth the effort.
