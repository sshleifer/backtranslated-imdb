I first saw this movie 40 years ago on television N.Y. and thought it was a depressing look for the future. Wells sees the restriction of private liberties as a good thing. ("no private aircraft.") The 30-plus plus war in the film was the reason why this movie was not shown to British movie goers making war. The best performance in acting is that of Ralph Richardson as the boss.A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from the comedy series Absolutely Fabulous.It is interesting to note that the boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to that of the movie. .
