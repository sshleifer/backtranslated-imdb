This film had a large set of adult actors along with a cast of young actors who will be in the movies for a long time if there is any justice. The direction and editing was great. I can search the book for which this was adapted, it must have been great. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight and Tim Blake Nelson were a blast to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but they were fun when they were on the screen. The kids at the camp could not have been better. (like I said, I liked it!)
