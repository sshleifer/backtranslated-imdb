I never knew of a movie to spark this debate in my life. Believe me when I say that this movie will eventually be remembered as a classic of all time. I was hoping in anticipation for this movie as I had already loved both Lock, Stock .... and Snatch, but after some of the negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I just loved this movie and can not wait to see it again. This film is totally different from both Ritchie movies mentioned above, and also much better. I have my choice of favorite directors, but none of them made such a big move as Guy Ritchie just did with this movie. I believe he took film production to another level (I know most people will laugh at this comment about the reaction to this film, but I believe time will prove to be right). This movie is very confusing and continues for much longer than the race time of 2 hours or more, because I could not stop thinking about it or trying to put things together. Now I have a good idea of ​​everything that happens in this film (some responses of endless hours of reasoning, some responses from reading other people about the movie) and now I can not wait until Sunday when I will see him again. I just hope people go to the movies with an open mind and they will be rewarded like me and many others.
