This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. He has very good acting from Hanks, Newman and all the others. Definitely the best performance of Jude Law. Cinematography is great, the editing is so good and it includes a great original score that really fits the mood of the movie. Production design is also a factor in what makes this film special. For me, it takes a lot to win the Godfather, but the fantastic cinematic shown wins this contest. Definitely a Best Movie nominee in my book.
