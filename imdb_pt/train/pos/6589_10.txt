I've loved this show since its first show, and I've always expected to watch every episode every week. The plot, characters, writing, special effects were great! Then the sci-fi channel missed again and canceled a very entertaining and well-written show. I say bring it back, I know all the actors would come back. I would suggest buying the DVD, I am. I hope that the executives of science fiction channels will know these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. I just watch a show on that channel right now, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure they'll soon be canceling it too.
