While watching this movie on video last night, I was left with these tingles that told me that this will last. I have the feeling that I will watch this again and again for years to come. <br /> <br /> It has all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story / movie. And even if some cultural references are obscure to me, a Western viewer, deep down, is a universal tale.
