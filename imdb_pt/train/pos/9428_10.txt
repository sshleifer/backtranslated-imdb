One of my favorite movies to date begins as an adventure on the wild side of a four-man Atlanta team. The idea of ​​living the Chulawasse River before it turns into a lake comes from Burt Reynold's Lewis, who unconsciously drowns his friends in his worst nightmare. But if the first half of the movie looks more like an action movie, the second half will take the viewer to a whole different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In a bad way. At the end of the movie, each person will be forced to deal with the scars of what had just been a weekend in the river, but silenced in a fight for survival. The film (except some pretty obvious goofs) is very well directed and beautifully filmed in a nature paradise that steals your breath. Photography is great too. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all excellent at showing how a single event can ruin four different lives in different ways just linked to the same mistake.
