A woman left alone after the death of her husband finds herself attracted to the friend and practical man of her son. In a slightly distorted story, the woman begins to sleep with the man in an effort to recover. The twisted part? The man at hand is also his daughter's love interest. <br /> <br /> As if this were not strange enough, the mother manages to fall in love with this man and when his daughter finds out, she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messy life in her poor mother. <br /> <br /> Although you may think ill of this woman, the truth is film manages to portray her in a positive light. Beautifully played by Anne Reid, this character has dimension and portrays a great emotion. <br /> <br /> A truly brilliant performance and a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
