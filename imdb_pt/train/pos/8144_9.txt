Having seen both "Fear of a Black Hat" and "This is Spinal Tap," I can honestly state that, although similar, both films are really mandatory. There will often be in "Fear" that you will become hysterical. No wonder why both films have a huge cult. "Fear" will be available soon on DVD. Rent it if you must, but the only way to enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself.
