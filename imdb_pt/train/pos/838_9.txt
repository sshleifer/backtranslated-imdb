*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott and Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> A well-written story and film together, Brosnan has never been better in a movie role out of his "Bond" movies. After 2004, "After the Sunset", his new role brings laughter and a great moment. The professional killer, so to speak, Julian Noble at a job in Mexico City ends up finding the exact opposite of himself, a highly influenced businessman, Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly one of his best roles) also in business there. The two duets on the screen produce a comically charged mutiny and can not laugh. Davis in one of his best roles since "American Splendor" gives another charming and witty performance. One of the nicest years and best movies. My final rating 9/10
