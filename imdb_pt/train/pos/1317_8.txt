This anime has been underestimated and still is. Hardly the movie of idiot kids as noted, I still come back to this 10 years after I first saw it. One of the best movies released. <br /> <br /> The animation, though not perfect, is good, the camera tricks give a 3D feel and the story is still so good today even after I have grown up and seen the breakers like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. She does not even have depth, but tries to see her in a cheerful way. It's a story to entertain, not to question. <br /> <br /> Still one of my favorites I come back also when I feel like it was a laugh about more cheerful animes. Not to mention it's a children's movie, there are surprisingly sad times in it and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
