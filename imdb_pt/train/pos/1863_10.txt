ANTWONE FISHER is the story of an emotionally disturbed young US Navy sailor. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his problems stem from his childhood. <br /> <br /> Prepare to shed a tear or two. The film could melt the heart colder. I loved the story, which transforms from something so horrible to happen to anyone in a positive ending. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful, most important film about forgiveness. Other important issues that make you think are child abuse, adoption, and social assistance. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner Denzel Washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut. There were many scenes I enjoyed watching. They included the beginning (dreams of a little boy, check out the gigantic pancakes!) And the ending (dreams have turned into reality), which beautifully tied the story together. Another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged Antwone to look for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that had abandoned him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and his reaction to him. Invaluable. <br /> <br /> All actors have represented their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing responsibilities, Washington continues to show why he won an Oscar and is successful in all his roles as an actor. He had a strong presence in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Derek Luke demonstrated why he was so right for the role of Antwone Fisher. He portrayed a very real and breathtaking job. Joy Bryant, who played the role of Cheryl, Antwone's love interest, seemed like a ray of sunshine on the screen. The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played the role of Mrs. Tate, a despicable character, deserves a special mention. <br /> <br /> Although we only see her in a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother did a great job. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
