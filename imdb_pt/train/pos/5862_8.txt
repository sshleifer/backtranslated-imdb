There is not much going on in this story - just two men employing very different ways of dealing with the memories of Vietnam. But what is lacking in the premise, more than makes up for in acting and realism. It's a quiet movie about the bonds of friendship and shared experience. We even got romance (not free - just another very real part of this story). Worth seeing.
