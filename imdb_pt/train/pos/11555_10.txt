A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is a wonderful movie that I can watch over and over again. It's definitely one of the top ten comedies made. With a great cast, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau wrote a perfect screenplay of Neil Simon, based on his play. <br /> <br /> It's real to the situation of life made perfectly. If you have a digital cable, one receives the menu at the bottom of the screen to show what is happening. Generally gives this movie ***% of stars, but in reality it deserves stars. If you really watch this movie, you can tell it will be so funny and cool in a hundred years.
