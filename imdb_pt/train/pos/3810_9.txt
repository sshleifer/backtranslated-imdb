This is my first review on IMDb, I really did not want to write one, but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now, I feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, I'm not associated with Os movie creators anyway (yeah, yeah, how often have you been here before?) FYI I'm in my late 20s <br /> <br /> First of all I have to admit that I really like movies of animation because you see it is limited only by the imagination of the creators and they were quite imaginative in this. Not so much in terms of history, but in achieving an original and unique visual style. The characters look good, but far from real and work well for the movie, after all it's a fairy tale world. But the scenery and the world in general are filled with stunning visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching it. The blue mini-dragon bunny resembles the show and easily has some of the funniest moments in the movie, it is already an instant classic as far as Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not very surprising (a lot of antiheroes have to leave and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but who cares if the movie looks and sounds so good ;-) 1 thing I have to point out, imo movie is not suitable for very young children because it has some darker scenes and maybe scary for kids under 6-8 I would say, these are just very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway, I had a lot of fun watching this and I can not wait for him to hit the high definition stores to watch it several times just for his beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
