The undisturbed William Powell. He is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world. He always seems on top of his game and shows little care to anyone who doubts him. Murders are projects, almost human beings. I noticed this is a staple of whodunnit. In addition to an occasional tearful widow, the victims serve the purpose of being the reason the film exists. Just it. There are enough twists to keep things interesting along the way and Powell is a master at it. There is a lot of political inaccuracy, especially as far as Asian artists are concerned. This is a little difficult to accept. The cast is great, and Curtiz's direction is also a consistent asset.
