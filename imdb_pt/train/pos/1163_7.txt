This film was released by Roger Corman, so you know that filmmakers did not have much money to work with. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may miss the subtleties of the film because of the typical "obsessed" killer type marketing approach, there are unique differences about this film. <br /> <br /> AMANDA as interpreted by the obviously talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character.Some people like these films precisely because violence may seem random, but here the ramifications of past abuse (treated realistically but tastefully) are what shape AMANDA's psychosis Surprisingly, Amanda redeems herself at the end with an act of love where most of these films turns into a typical fight, all to death and the evil character dies so poorly in the end as to begin. > Some edges in this photo, but I have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on your consideration and yes, originality compared to the usual - especially on a budget.
