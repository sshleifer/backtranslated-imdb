Most of the comments were positive, but I would add that viewers should also focus on sets. The designer set used many beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It pays to pay attention. The film is driven by the characterization and symbolism that is very rich. All the gangster actors were chosen - it was like seeing old friends and it was a pleasure. The dialogue was fun at times, but rough at times, and I suppose it was meant to be. This is the movie of a movie buff. It was done by people, people who love the medium. Do not miss this one.
