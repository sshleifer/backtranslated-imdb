Many people hated this movie, but I blame two facts: 1 - They want it to be a lot like the first couple of American Pie movies. and 2 - they are trying to take this very seriously. <br /> <br /> The one I found was the best of all six, and I absolutely love Dwight. The plot is predictable, I'll say it, but then what teen comedy is not it? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds etc etc, they are incredibly predictable, but still funny! I say this is worth watching, I love it, I think hilarious. Just do not watch while comparing with the first ones because it's nothing like it. <br /> <br /> After watching Naked Mile and this one, it became obvious that all American Pie movies were about, and just about, the Stiflers. What is FINE for me. <br /> <br /> Watch. Appreciate. Love. xD
