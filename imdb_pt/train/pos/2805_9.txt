Wow, I can not believe I waited so long to see this movie. I never got to watch it. The plot has nothing to interest me. I do not know anything about football. I'm one of those American idiots who has no idea. I had never seen David Beckham before this movie. I chose to ignore the buzz around this movie the moment it was released in America. Enough of me. <br /> <br /> Truth be told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of cinematic sky. What a funny movie. It is full of color and exuberance. I had a silly grin on my face all through the movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and kind that you can not help but cheer for her. No wonder why the American television program E.R. snatched it. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. These people know how to have fun. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was to decipher some of the British slang and dialogue with the accents. I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I did not miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the movie!). I'm sure audiences all over the world have a hard time understanding the ever-changing slang in American films as well. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date movie. It has a big sports network like Rocky and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women. I watched with my wife, and niece of sixteen, and we all loved it. I recommend.
