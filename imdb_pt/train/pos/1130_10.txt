'Iphigenia' is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterful game is masterfully adapted to the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast. Cacoyannis got the impossible. He was able to film a Greek tragedy on screen without losing its effectiveness and importance. A Greek star cast helps you in that. Newcomer Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive as Iphigenia. Equally striking is Irene Papas, who, although sometimes seem exaggerated, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent music track by Mikis Theodorakis, which is ideal in all scenes. <br /> <br /> Q. Rumors say the movie lost the Oscar for best foreign film by only 1 vote !!!
