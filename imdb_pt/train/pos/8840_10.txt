Watch Before The Devil counts as one of my best ever experiences in the movies. I was intrigued by the mixed response to the film - and to me, extremes of opinion indicate that the film touched on something that was embraced or rejected by the general audience. It's one of those movies that stayed with me, and I keep pondering and thinking about it. <br /> <br /> Surely the DVD would brighten up some of the themes and elements of filmmaking? These include: Sidney Lumet's return film, the time-shifting technique implanted in the narrative, the excellent combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, the magisterial direction, the relatively rare focus that Hollywood movies give to male characters and struggle to become an open checkbook for their women, Marisa Tomei's under-presented yet resonant performance, and of course the superb Hoffman with that central monologue on the sum of its parts - for me the heart of the movie. <br /> <br /> Phew! Certainly a masterful film. So imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly awaited DVD - just not to find comments, not backstage, no interviews, no extras. <br /> Hey - distributors - fix it!
