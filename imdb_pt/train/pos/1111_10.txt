This is not "so bad it's good", it's purely good! For those who do not understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment ...) Anyway, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of yours, a parody of yours and a parody of me . It is the most brilliant text in film history. I have this and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It incorporates the recognition of the absurd and weakens everything you or I call the standard. I write scripts and this movie, alone, opened a comedy genre for me, which we never saw. It can only be taken in parts ... it's a kind of exploration ... so far I'm just trying to catch the minimum of ten lines. My comment ended a while back. I hope it works when I send it now.
