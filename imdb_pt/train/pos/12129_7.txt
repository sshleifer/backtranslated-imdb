This is a well directed film by John Cromwell, who was not a great director, but who made some fine films, including the 1937 version of "The Prerser of Zenda." Set in a London that only Hollywood managed to achieve, atmospheric, but nothing like the real thing, is a story of obsession and frustrated love, Somerset Maughan's novel. <br /> <br /> I was eager to see it. on DVD as I had never seen before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her first greats. So I bought it. Well, she looked fine, but I'm sorry to say that her London accent made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest actors in the movies, make no mistake, but here she made one. It was impossible to take his character seriously. It was not as horrible as Dick Van Dyke's cockney accent, Mary Poppins, but close. <br /> <br /> In another important role, Leslie Howard did it superbly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor. The supporting actors acquit themselves well. Worth watching, despite Davis's vocal gymnastics.
