I watched the first series eagerly, but wondered if I would return again after a long pause. However, I tuned in to Episode 1 of Series 2 and got addicted again. This really is excellent television; innovative material such as Mission Impossible in the 1960s. Characters are well rounded and expand as the series progresses, they change as they adapt - some more readily than others - to the new environment, but intelligently remain strictly in character, and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for Someone whom you would not have thought you could feel sorry for when something really overwhelming happens to them. I hope there are many years of 'Lost' to wait - and I do not care much about it if I never get answers to all the mysteries!
