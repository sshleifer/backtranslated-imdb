This is a very strange movie. It appears as a film of exploitation with excessive violence and unreal situations, but unusual for being built around rural characters at war with each other, as opposed to an 'other' invader. The film is an excessive stereotype of Vietnam veterans in a long list of films portraying veterans of that war as dangerous psychopaths. Kris Kristofferson's last sentence is "I Still Have not Lost a War" as he meets his death after a long trail of murder and destruction, including the city's chief of police and his brother's girlfriend in a particularly scary scene. However, Kristofferson is an actor good enough and charismatic enough to carry this villain to a surprising depth. Vincent is clearly the golden boy, but with enough intensity over his clean goodness. The film bears some resemblance to the plot of Winchester 73, where Jimmy Stewart tries to tolerate a criminal brother until he is forced to act against him. <br /> <br /> The movie has b-movie quality action despite the presence of Kristofferson, Vincent. , a beautiful Victoria Principal and Bernadette Peters give her an A level formation. <br /> <br /> I give the 7 because it is a vision long lost in an American psyche of introspection and paranoia post-Vietnam / pre -Reagan and confusion, and a film industry that was willing to address such topics at that time. <br /> <br /> Seen on the THIS channel, a great network that continues to reproduce many old films from the 70s to the 90s, regardless of political leanings.
