One of the best, if not the best rock'n'roll movies of all time. And it's not just mindless fun. There were really many smart jokes in her. Of course I love the Ramones. But with all the themes "anarchy" and "I hate high school," the film does not take itself too seriously, which is great. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie for the first time. the spring of 1980, and I've seen it again recently. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it has kind of made me homesick. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie does not take itself seriously and is not pretentious like so many other children's films of the seventies, eighties and nineties. And to speak, it's not really dirty or disgusting either. Only PG rated. This is rare for a movie in this category. A great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule.
