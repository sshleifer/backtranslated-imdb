Many people commented that this movie was not nearly as good as the first. Well, maybe it's not - for you. However, how does your child react to it? Well, mine loved me more than the first. <br /> <br /> Disney past movies can sometimes be a bit harsh for young children. (For example - Bambi's mother got shot.) This movie was great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings. <br /> <br /> If you want to be snobbish about what the Disney standards should be based on in the past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a good-hearted little boy that you really want to please, buy this movie and treat your young children. This movie is great as a movie at bedtime for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I'm happy with a movie that appeals to my son and does not have to impress parents all the time.
