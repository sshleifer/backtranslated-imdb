Haunted by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks redemption by radically transforming the lives of seven people he does not know. Once your plan is set, nothing will be able to stop it. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben had not planned to fall in love with one of these people, and it was she who would eventually turn him. Will Smith is back with director Gabriele Muccino, following the inspirational film "The Pursuit of Happiness." "Seven Pounds" is another life-changing movie experience, which not only reminds you of your previous collaboration, but also inspires you with joy in the end. Will Smith is also the producer again with some of the others. These films are very realistic, portraying the life of an ordinary man and his struggles for life. Seven pounds may have taken some time to gain its real boost, but only after half an hour of the movie, the film is ready to dominate your heart. In addition, this movie has some twists, which allows viewers to continue to guess. Director Gabriele Muccino is once again the winner, with his emotional but inspirational message. It makes all the characters in the movie very real, that people would actually find themselves somewhere in the movie. Along with the director, Will Smith is another winner with his excellent acting skills. Once again, the duo of the director and the actor works like a charm. In addition, there are other talented actors in the film who have done their part very well. Rosario Dawson, beauty with brain, is how it can be called. She looks beautiful and does her part extremely well. Barry Pepper is very supportive of the film and Woody Harrelson does the same, although Woody did not have much time on the screen (it would have been nice if he had more). You will not forget this movie with ease. Watch this movie and change your life. First class cinema!
