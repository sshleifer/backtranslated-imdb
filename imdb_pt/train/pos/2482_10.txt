The actors play wonderfully, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams got Osiric's comedic role, otherwise it would be a bit strange to see him in such production. It's really great that Kenneth decided to use the fuller version of the text, this happens definitely not very often ... Thanks to this viewers can see the whole, not the chosen one - by the director - parties. Also - thank goodness the film is in a classic shape; NOT for surreal fanfaberies! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive, but even so Hamlet is a different story, at least that's my point of view.
