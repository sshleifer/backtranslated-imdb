Playing as a kind of pre-runner to The Great Escape about 13 years later, this crushing little British movie plays straight without emotions and dare to do exaggeration. The first part of the film is the montage and subsequent escape of our protagonists, while the second part focuses on their survival while they are on the run as they try to reach Sweden. The film is based on pure characters with a simple, effective and convincing dialogue to carry it out, and achieves its goals generously. No small amount of suspense keeps the movie going, and as an adventure story, it works perfectly for the length of time it sticks, so is it a big sign of the movie that may be the first of its kind? <br /> 7/10
