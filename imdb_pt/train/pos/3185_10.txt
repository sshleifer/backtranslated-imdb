Nice tale ........ voted ten against all averages for my age and sex ... not so much comedy (compared to a movie I almost wet myself), although funny enough. I'm not a fan of musicals, probably a little too much for me, but they give me time to have a drink or soda without losing anything important. maybe a 1950s version of when Harry first met Sally? Do not say no, not really, but if this is in your top ten as is mine you will like this movie. in fact, this leaves you with a sense of warmth, remembering what romance could and should be, something to photograph. My summary best describes in a nutshell ..... quite charming
