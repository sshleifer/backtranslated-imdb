Bizarre horror movie, full of famous faces, but stolen by Cristina Raines (later TV from "Flamingo Road") as a beautiful but unstable model with a malicious smile that is programmed to pay for her suicide attempts, Gate of hell! The scenes with Raines' modeling are very well captured, the mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina's friend, but when Raines moves to a creepy Brooklyn Heights building (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor ), things really start to cook. The neighbors, including a fantastically evil Burgess Meredith and an eccentric couple, Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo, are diabolical, and Eli Wallach is a lot of fun as a shrewd police detective. The film is almost a cross-pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, "The Sentinel" is frighteningly scary, full of shocks brought by director Michael Winner, who mounts a carefully thoughtful ending with skill. *** 1/2 of ****
