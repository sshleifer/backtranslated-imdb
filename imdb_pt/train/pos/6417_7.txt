The inspiring story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and later joined the US Navy, aspired to be the first Black Master Diver in the history of the Navy. We are shown the series of childhood struggles that Brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true (and then to keep it alive.) The least important challenge was Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the head coach of the diving school that the Navy sends to Brashear, which is not particularly friendly to Brashear's goals, but which ends up becoming an unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; fast and with lots of action, although it's not a "pic action" in the normal sense of the word. There is a very human story here as well, and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; there is also a sense of the struggle that occurred in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers (the "old navy" versus the "new navy"). The performances are very good - particularly Goodings. I thought DeNiro was perhaps a bit overdone in his Sunday interpretation (although, on Sunday, it might as well have been that extreme type of loose cannon) and the portrait of Sunday's wife Gwen (of Charlize Theron) also made me question whether these parts were "animated" to provide entertainment value. <br /> <br /> A good movie, though. I never wondered if it would be worth tinkering with. <br /> <br /> 7/10
