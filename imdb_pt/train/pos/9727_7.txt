Simon Pegg plays a rude and often out of control rude journalist who is brought in from England to work in a major American magazine. Of course, your winning ways create all sorts of complications. Fun comedy based on facts that co-starred by Kristen Dunst (looking quite grown up), Danny Huston and Jeff Bridges. It works mainly because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior. We completely understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him, despite her frequent idiots. I like the movie. Not everything and end it all, but it was a good way to crown a night of sitting on the couch watching movies. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
