The man who directed 'The Third Man' also directed the sequel 'Who Will Buy' in 'Oliver!' Now that's talent. <br /> <br /> I lift my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know there are 'second units' involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> /> I suppose the quality will come out. <br /> <br /> (He appears in the final scene with Nancy [avoiding spoiler - everyone has to see Oliver! for the first time at some point].) How many lines do I need to type. Encouraging people to type a lot should not be encouraged. <br /> <I hope this counts as the "tenth line".
