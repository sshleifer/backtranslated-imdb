I decided not to believe what the famous movie critics say. Even though this movie has not received the best reviews, this movie made my day. That made me think. What a fake world that is. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your loved ones deceive you? It is said that no matter how many times you give milk to a snake, it will never be loyal and will bite when you have a chance. In the same way some people are such that they are never grateful. This movie is about how selfish people can be and how they are all, ultimately just thinking about themselves and working for themselves. <br /> <br /> A brother dies inadvertently in the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new actor Aryan performed well. The actress who played Amitabh's wife stole the show. Her role was small, but she portrayed her role so diligently that she is thrilled with her performance. Chawla had very good facial expressions, but his role was very limited and he did not have the chance to express himself fully. <br /> <br /> A great film by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His films always give a message to the public. His films are like novels by Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist who always had a purpose and aimed at social evil) because they have a real message for the public. They are fun as well as teaching.
