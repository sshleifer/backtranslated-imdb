What I love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and is a blast to experience their everyday love, humor and adventure. The magic literature is so diverse, depicting the ideas of classical, medieval and modern magic such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina the Teenage Witch, this show is so fun and unique because it allows us to experience a lot of that modern magic seven seasons! This show has so many great qualities and it is a joy to see Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal world and "other." I would recommend this to any family because the TV series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!
