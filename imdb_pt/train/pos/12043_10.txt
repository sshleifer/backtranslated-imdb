... On stage, on TV or in a book, "The Woman in Black" is an excellent story of ghosts. Other reviewers have said almost everything there is to say about this movie, but I thought I'd add my little late review as well. The film made for TV has a deliberately slow first act, which narrates the main character Arthur while he works as a lawyer in London in the 1920s. I can understand why this may not please all palates. However, for me, I love this British style of storytelling similar to any BBC adaptation of "Ghost Story for Christmas" from the work of the great M.R. James. In the second act, the ghost story comes on the scene as Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss, to arrange the business of a deceased client. The third act relentlessly accumulates to a chilling conclusion ... As a Londoner, I saw the play. I own the book, DVD-R and got the full audio book on my iPod as well. What's right for me, 'The Women in Black' in any medium is a ghost story with few equals. It's about time we had a legitimate version of 2 DVDs.
