The Best of Times is one of the greatest sleepers of all time. Configuration does not overburden your patience, development is stable, many intertwined relationships are carefully established, jokes and bits work and everyone is funny. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell, in the role of Reno Hightower, does one of his best performances, and Robin Williams, playing with Jack Dundee, is as confident as ever. The cast also includes many great supporters. Jack's wife is played by the daughter of Jack Palance, who is adorable, as is Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I watched this movie, how many times I liked it and how many times I wish more people could see it.
