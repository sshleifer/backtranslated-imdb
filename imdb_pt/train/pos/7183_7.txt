This is a perfect series for family viewing. We gather around the TV to watch this on BBC America. It is an updated version of Robin Hood and appeals to children and adults. Our teenagers and teens like to sit down with Mom and Dad and watch Robin's next feats. We can not wait for the next episode to air every week and we are happy for the free "On Demand" preview. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe has a current fashion spot. There is a moral to every story. It's fun. Violence is not exaggerated or unnecessary. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with the feel of John William. It is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world talent. <br /> <br /> There's so much trash on television, from the brain rotting TV from "reality" to senseless violence. You should take this to what is and what is a "Robin Hood" updated not to be compared to the exploits of Errol Flynn's film. This is a gem to be enjoyed by all. Parents who are worried about their children watching too much violence will like that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood who prefers to try to reason over a disagreement than to fight. Maid Marian is also an attractive model for girls. Instead of standing by and doing nothing, she assumes her own role in helping the poor by being the "Night Watchman." The sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously exaggerated, just as the sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor, who makes most women wish he did not portray the role of a "bad guy". <br /> <br /> The only question we have is "Where's Frei Tuck?"
