I was a bit afraid to watch this movie because of its fees. But living in Italy titles like this never cross and I love both the step I decided to try. And how surprised! The story is unlike any other dance film I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just "winning." It is moving and well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, she is so mature and focused and AWARE of her TALENT (and the talent that Rutina Wesley has, my jaw dropped in the final dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is, honestly, inspirational. In addition, the fact that she is not the super hot girl (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her very attractive and real. Seriously, why is this movie rated so low? You can understand within the first 5 minutes that is a good job. Really good, actually. I even cried at the end of the movie. And the dance routines are just sick.
