Pushing daisies is truly a milestone on television as an art form. Everything seems to pay homage to Amelie and Tim Burton, but then, in a world where new ideas are clearly rare, this show will ensure that you do not care if it's new or not. It's simply Brilliant. <br /> <br /> I've been captivated from the start, intelligent writing, directing to the scenarios and dialogues make this show the most incredible masterpiece since The Shield and the Wire (okay, not exactly good comparisons, but the beauty of pushing Daisies is that it has no comparisons on television). <br /> <br /> Truly addictive and an absolute pleasure. Maybe as one of Piemakers pies mentioned in such a tempting way.
