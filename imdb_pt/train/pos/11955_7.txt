Allow yourself to be transported to a different kind of old school history. Scoop is the classic Woody Allen. Allen's latest muse, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared at last year's Match Point, also by Allen), is surprisingly able to soften her sensual sex appeal and turn into a Normal looking student type with the help of nerdish glasses and clothes, but still can not get the audience to believe how Hugh Jackman's Lordly character can be so in love with her, given the royalty background (do not worry, there are no spoilers here). There are no major transformations for the character of Johansson here, since she always plays the same character despite the script saying otherwise. You even forgive your character's apparent lack of logic by continuing a case with a serial killer suspect, simply because he is your Royal Hotness Jackman, who is refreshing to see without Wolverine's failure. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is what Allen is 70 years old. He continues to tell his stories about celluloid in the same way he always did; as if it had never been exposed to modern cinema, which is probably what makes its films simple and silent appealing. They never seem to point to a specific market; as if Allen made movies just to his liking, whether the audience likes it or not.
