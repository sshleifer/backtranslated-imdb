I have to admit to liking bad movies. I love them, I watch them all. Horror especially. My friends and I all got together after a hard week at school and at work, rented some crazy tapes, ordered pizza and had a blast. This one had a big box so I was expecting less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a housing project that is built on a nuclear facility that had the above ground layers intimidated, and the other underground layers are simply covert. The inhabitants of this neighborhood find the facility covered when some children fall into a hole inside a cave. This wakes up some zombies. <br /> <br /> From this point on, it's a city-piece. The bloody effects and action never stop until the final credits roll. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not a great art, but this one, with its joke dialogues and horrible exaggerated things, was everyone's favorite. in the evening. In fact, it was one of the best "party ribbons" I've ever had the pleasure of watching. And you could say it was made out of money, with a lot of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he does a special turn) and it's just a crazy trip.
