I watched the movie today and it just amazed me. It's a real work of art and I do not understand why most people think it's crap. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your ego away and then you will have the true power! This was the main battle at the end of the film and Guy Ritchie showed it in a magnificent way. "The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will look" - remember the movie? Because our true enemy is in us - it is our ego ... That voice that always tells us that we are important, that gives us our pride, that tells us not to give but only to take, that creates our aggression, who wants to be in control, this creates all negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in a surprising way and showed that the only way to get real control is when you lose control and simply let go of your personal importance. A superb movie!
