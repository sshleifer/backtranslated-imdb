The minute I started watching, I realized that I was watching a quality production so I was not surprised to find out that the script was written by Andrew Davis and it was produced by Sue Birtwhistle that brought us the excellent production of Pride and Prejudice of 1995 ! So my only complaint here is that Emma did not run for 3 or 4 or maybe even 6 episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The performance was superb, with excellent Prunella scales like Miss Bates, but I loved both Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. Language is a delight to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right to go to someone without actually uttering a curse word? Samantha Morton was excellent as Ms. Smith, in fact, the cast was in place as in Pride and Prejudice. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! So once again thank the BBC for another quality piece of television. I've seen the Paltrow version and it's okay, but I think the BBC version is far superior. An excellent production that I am very happy to own on DVD !!!
