The film was much better than the other reviewer stated. It's a good family movie. It has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her building. Of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances. She meets and befriends a girl her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways. She is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run. This reminds me of a Hallmark movie, so take a chance and decide for yourself. It seemed to be more geared towards children from 6 to 12 years old (maybe a little older) and is practically rated PG or G. I am an adult who can enjoy a good movie "family" - I guess the other reviewer is not .
