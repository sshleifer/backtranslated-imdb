How could you say that Peaches, with his complex narrative dealing with myriad issues, is "a little TV idea" is beyond me. Also, I can think of many movies that have "a little TV idea" in their plots. Her obvious aversion to the TV industry ("Sue Smith Failed to Beat Her Television History") is confusing. particularly because you are having a "great time" working on TV. If we could all be as talented as Mrs. Smith (no, I'm not a friend or relative) - Award-winning AFI of Christ's Brides, Coorain Road, etc. All made for TV. Come to think of it, and about the other "little TV ideas" like "Against the Wind", "Bodyline", "The dismissal", "scales of justice", "Blue Murder", "Water under the bridge", etc . I think Peaches is a good entertainment film that interested me, and most of my friends, too, from beginning to end. It's far from flawless, but I think it's among the best Australian films I've seen in the past two years. Who knows, with a few more visions (there's plenty to think about), it may just be with classics like "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground." I really enjoyed this movie much more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". These films, I think, had their moments - surrealistic, atmospheric, realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues, but as for the pure entertainment for me and me, it was very common, if not boring. When I go to a movie, I'm always aware of the audience's reaction to a movie (through reactions in the movies and conversations heard in the foyer and bathroom). Some left Peaches shaking their heads, some with negative criticism, but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience.
