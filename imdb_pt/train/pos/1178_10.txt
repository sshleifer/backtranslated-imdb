This may be the second best WWE PPV of the year after Wrestlemania, it was a good surprise! John Cena had an excellent match in which he angered Chris Jericho. Jeff Hardy kept the IC title in a short, sloppy match with Willam Regal. Bubba and Spike Dudley won a very violent game against Benoit & Guerrero. Jamie Noble had a good match with Kidman, which was surprising for me. Booker T defeated The Big Show in a match without dq, at one point Booker T gave the Big Show scissor kick and sent him straight to the table. In a stupid decision by WWE Christian and Lance Storm, jealous anti-Americans defeated Hogan and Edge with much help from Test and Jericho. RVD and Brock had the night game which was filled with great high points and RVD managed to keep his ic title through a QQ so I was glad he kept the title. Triple H also signed with Eric Bischoff and Raw, which means little or nothing. And in the main event, Rock became the first 7-time WWE Champion to defeat Kurt Angle & Undertaker in a triple fight. Overall, this is probably the 2nd best WWE PPV of 2002! 7/10
