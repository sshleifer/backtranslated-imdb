For the first three seasons, Sabrina was a hidden gem on TGIF (and later, school afternoon reruns). Each episode had a manic, zen energy and fast paced that surpassed the occasional bland joke. Melissa Joan Hart exuded a great talent for physical comedy, particularly in her facial expressions. His two aunts, playing "heterosexual men," or as straight as two witches could be, had great comic timing and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, like a talking cat, was free to get involved in any crazy scheme he was interested in, and one could laugh and understand everything calmly because he was, after all, a talking cat. Sabrina's friends completed the social experience at the school, which also housed the typical "evil cheerleader" and the "totalitarian principal." Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the program has been the ability to merge pop culture (eg, bands of the time, Jerry Springer), archetypal human condition / morality (eg, the importance of friendship, Christmas spirit) literal of such related metaphors in the Magical Kingdom. Unfortunately, like so many other shows throughout the television era, the show peaked during the first three years, which coincided with Sabrina's presence in high school. Beginning in season four, the move to college marked what would become a precipitous decline in the overall quality of the show, particularly when the writers chose Josh as Harvey's rival, and made up excuses for aunts Hilda and Zelda remaining onscreen. as main players. The final season, where Sabrina works in a pop culture magazine, was unmistakably disappointing. Still, in the end, Sabrina (particularly her high school years) remains a unique entry as a hybrid situational comedy with magical elements that elevates her above the grueling fare that is produced in this genre each year.
