This was a really cool movie. This only proves that you do not need silly things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. It crosses continents in seconds, people are hit and nothing happens to them, burned swords, samuari fight against galleons sinking, David Essex is the epitome of villainy and John Rhys Davies is just the guy. I liked this movie but I like s ** t movies, this is the perfect example of a movie that s ** t just the KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth you will love this movie, its buck, its fast, its silly, its samuarait√°stico !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It also looks like it was made in 1972
