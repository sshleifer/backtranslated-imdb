Intriguing. Exciting. Dramatic. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that just touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the great story that is being LOST. <br /> <br /> From acting to rare visual effects, LOST is the essential television program for fans of science. -Fiction, fantasy, action, adventure and many mysteries. <br /> <br /> Each member of the cast is so well chosen, and so good in their roles, that you love them, or hate them, or frankly wish them dead. <br /> <br /> Visual effects, when used (which is rare) are actually very well done considering the usual production of shows. Be the "monster of smoke" for polar bears, LOST is believable in terms of eye drops. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes, nothing can compare to the vast complexity that this program made the spectators I support. Beginning to the end, continuity is virtually perfect, characters are developed, and ever-evolving history slowly gives answers to the questions that so many crave. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is virtually no flaw in LOST. For dramatic television and science fiction, what Arrested Development did for comedy: set the standard. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend to those who are patient, intellectual and love every moment of the walk, no matter how long it takes to get to the end. <br /> <br /> Watch this show.
