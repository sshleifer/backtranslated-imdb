REINADO ABOUT ME (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen, Paula Newsome. Sometimes affecting and sometimes mediocre drama about a completely depressed man who lost his family on September 11 (Sandler in his best role since "Punch-Drunk Love") that ends up meeting with his old college friend and friend (Cheadle continuing to do an impressive job with all the papers to date), a well-done dentist who seems to have it all? family, wealth, happiness? but really sees an ally in freedom with the personal life offers of his troubled friend. Written and directed by Binder (who co-stars as Sandler's ex-best friend and acting accountant) with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the movie works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls on an almost movie -de-film the porridge of the week to find a solution to the issues in question.
