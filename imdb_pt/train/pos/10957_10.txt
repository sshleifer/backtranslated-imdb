This show probably will not please everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she does not ask for permission and does not apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, dinosaur robots, flying cars and a team of male cheerleaders who steal wallets. The star of the show is not a hero, she's a spoiled and fanatic pervert. If you can not appreciate the unusual humor it offers, the show is probably not for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It features the comedy style of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn, Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also shows the best talents of the growing online community, channel101.com. (If you are in this show, keep an eye on "The Department of Acceptable Media" on vh1 this March, it will be using the same talent pool.) <br /> <br /> Watch Sarah Silverman's show. That sort of thing is the future of entertainment.
