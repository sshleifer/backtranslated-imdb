I appreciated the photography, the textures, the colors and often, unlike a commentary, the lighting. What was missing for me was a coherent plot. I found it often disjointed, poorly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one in 125m. Possibly the cuts and legends did not help. I applaud all the movies that escape the cast of Hollywood, but this has left me disappointed. Miss Gillain was bright and the performances were all well, I just wanted a bit more dialogue. If anyone wants to see another movie that has some affinity with it, try "Hideous Kinky" with Kate Winslet.
