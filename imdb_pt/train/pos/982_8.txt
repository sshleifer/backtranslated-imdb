This is one of those westerns that, well, is practically alone in the not relieved quality of his dialogue. Very few can endure in the long run. That being said, the rest is very bad. However, I am giving him an eight because there is no other Westerner with a consistently good dialogue, with perhaps the exception of The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner and maybe a few more. It's full of weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore is the most glaring. However, it has a truly memorable scene. Nothing like this. It is shortly after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff, and goes to Jack Elams's place trying to incite him into a fight. Wonderful things. Right with the best in any western.
