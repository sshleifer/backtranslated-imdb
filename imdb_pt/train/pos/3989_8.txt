"The Mother" tells of a mother of two adult children (Reid), recently widowed, 60, who, shortly after her husband's death, finds herself awake from a life of sleepwalking when she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also married lover of his daughter. The film rests on her calmly passive mother, her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter, the silent needs she tries to soothe in bed with her young mistress and the convolutions that spring from there. A somewhat antiseptic drama with resounding psychodramatic resonances, "The Mother" does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically, avoiding free sensationalism. It will play better with the more mature audience, possibly women, who may have better empathy with the central character, their needs and problems. (B +)
