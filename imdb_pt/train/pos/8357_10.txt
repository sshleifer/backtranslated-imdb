A wonderful, streaming, often lyrical, movie that takes you always smiling even though there are really shocking incidents along the way. One chokes on the way women are treated and yet in the end they seem to be doing very well and it is a great credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes work so well. This is possibly the best performance of Depardieu, certainly the most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs exceptionally well in what must have been a very difficult role to play, including vigorous sex scenes with some guys at least half their age. Miou-Miou is lovely and has very difficult to play scenes. Initially, this sounds like a misogynist hoax / crook, but as the tale and characters unfold, a much more tender and honest picture emerges. In the end, this uncompromising and daring film demands respect.
