The Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers the Radium X - a powerful force to be used in atomic energy. Unfortunately Rukh has been contaminated by the radio and begins to glow in the dark - and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but Rukh begins to go mad because of the radio and the antidote and leaves to kill everything he believed to have harmed him. <br /> <br /> The plot is silly and the "effects" that make Karloff shine in the dark are laughable, but it's still a fun cooler. He moves quickly, has a great atmosphere (watch Rukh's "home" and the movie starts on a dark, rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. There is also good acting by Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So that's fine, but just a little below all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is too exaggerated for me to swallow. Yet I did so. I give a 7.
