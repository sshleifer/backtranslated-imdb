It's great how this movie pulls you. I had honest chuckles. I do not care that it's low budget because the thing works for me. To be honest, my wife did not do it the same way, but she prefers a different kind of movie. She admitted, though, that she was very creative and well-set and probably all on a shoe string. These characters who have strange, troubled lives give me something to relate to in my own world. Just go on and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. Watching this movie a second and third time, I realized that there are some hidden moments that passed me the first time. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. Anyway I liked it. I hope to see more.
