Breaking Glass is a movie that all aspirants to be in the music industry should see more than once. It's a very somber story about how a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and make as much money out of it as possible. Looking at some of today's 'star-studded' TV shows in the UK and abroad, I always remember this movie. Although not an expert on the subject, the winners of these shows tend to have a great initial success and then come down from there. This movie is prior to these shows, although the effect looks the same. After getting rid of her manager, played brilliantly by Phil Daniels, slowly but surely the label changes her lyrics and puts her on stimulants and she ends up being totally exhausted. You potential stars of tomorrow .... WATCH THAT AND CARE !!!
