I love this episode of Columbus. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is in it and is wonderful as successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is delighted to see herself as the lovely and lovable writer who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident. She blames the niece's husband, the nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police abandoned her. I would have loved someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I've never really liked Hartley personally. And of course, with Columbo, there are some laughs like when he questions Veronica in a belly dance class. Abigail de Ruth is a clever detective and she combines intelligence with Columbus always played wonderfully by Peter Falk.
