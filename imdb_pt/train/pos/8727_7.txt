Insect life is a good movie. But for me, it does not compare to movies like Toy Story and stuff. Do not get me wrong, I liked this movie, but it was not as good as Toy Story. The film has visuals, laughs and others that Toy's story had. But the movie did not look so ... I do not know, but I thought it was still a very good movie. <br /> <br /> A life of insects ... I do not mean it, it's a movie that I can not remember. I saw it years ago. Of course I have not seen the Toy story for years, but I still remember it. I should not have reviewed this movie, but I am. I'm having a joke, although it's not exactly the best job Pixar has done. <br /> <br /> The life of an insect: *** / ****
