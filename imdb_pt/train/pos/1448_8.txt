Across the country and especially on the political scene, people with any kind of political ambition should take time to see this film. The film is called "City Hall" and, with little imagination, its synopsis can occur anywhere in America. Turns out this happens in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough experience to run a large metropolitan city with very little effort. His right-hand man is none other than Vice Mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally brilliant individual whose ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seem destined for a higher position. It all points in that direction, until a police shooting ignites an investigation led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes the blame points to the city hall and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and the death of a police officer are attributed to a career criminal whose questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up for political payments and corruption in the city involving union leaders like Danny Aiello, played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judicial officials like judge. Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also implicated are party officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff), who works for the New York probation office. But it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy who is taken to task by accidental shooting. An excellent vehicle for Cusack and a right candidate to become a classic. ****
