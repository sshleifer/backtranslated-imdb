Through the great division we call understanding, there is still much that we do not know about what was explained by the early tribal Elders. In any case, there is much about the dangers of knowing too much. On the other hand, there are those who warn us not to prepare for what they warn that is the "end times". In this film called "The Last Wave," an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent, except they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney appointed to defend the defendant. Although haunted by prophetic images of his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by a sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as a Tribal Law and therefore is not subject to standard justice. The film is replete with dark and enigmatic images of apocalyptic world disasters and alert for the island's future tsunami and destruction. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film a frightening fascination and therefore not for the faint of heart, in fact, the simplest haunted appearances can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Good silent drama. ****
