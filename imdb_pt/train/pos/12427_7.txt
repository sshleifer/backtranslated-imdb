This movie has a lot of gross potential. The script is clear, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (though it may lose the fancy voices), the direction and the cinematography are surprisingly good, although some of the experiences do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. Once a nerd kid, always a nerdy kid; and the sad and simple fact is that he is unable to play anything other than Fox Mulder. He postures, he tries to be smooth, he puts, he tries to be macho. In the end, he just tries too hard. He exaggerates his character, he overcomes his lines, and he is overcome in every way by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are in a class above him in terms of acting ability. Timothy Hutton was (as always) very good. There were one or two moments when he dramatized his role, but you could tell he was enjoying it. He looked the part, and he became the character physically and atmospheric. Angelina Jolie was also very good. She did not have much paper; in fact, I thought she might have used a much stronger one ... her character was not sufficiently developed, although she did remarkably well with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was apparent (dammit, maybe that's why Uma left him ...;) In all, it was difficult, but a solid effort of a good cast and great supporting roles. If David Duchovny had not ripped his paper into pieces, it would have been much better. 7/10
