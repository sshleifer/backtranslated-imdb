Tess from Storm Country was a Mary Pickford vehicle that I intended to get for some time. I finally found a copy on VHS for a reasonable price and I started to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Mary gives her a typical and brave innocent portrait of a girl on the wrong side of the tracks who wins the heart of a rich heir. But this time the stakes are higher: an accusation of false murder, an illegitimate child (and the subsequent case of a misguided mother) and a planned suicide. <br /> <br /> You can see why Pickford wanted to redo this. The story is a tale of real morality, the kind she loved to star. Controversial topics are not always clearly explained; a viewer has to pay attention and pick up tips to catch whatever is being implied in the first view? although everything is more or less explained in the end. <br /> <br /> The only negative remark I can make would be about Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, appears to be about 6 to 6 pounds, is sent off in a panic when a 60-kilogram chocolate lab snakes in his direction! So, to complete (or perhaps to justify his disconcerting fear of the dog), he manages to pin him to the ground and somehow hurts him so much that he is still struggling to get up much later when a storm hits! This is the same lovely lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and hugs with Mary! However, Mary then throws boiling water on Ben's face, which barely slows him down! Okay, I blew Ben and the chocolate lab! Other than that, the film was quite touching and certainly caught my eye. Pickford's support cast was strong and convincing. This is certainly among his best films.
