With Tony badly injured in an induced coma, two things happen: Tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman at a business convention while his family and friends go through hell trying to deal with the possible loss of the great man. The dream sequences are out of an old episode of TWILIGHT ZONE when Tony finds himself transformed into a middle Joe trying to deal with a lost wallet and mixed identities during a business trip across the country. His intonation as a schnook of blazer and khaki is more mid-American and less of an Italian villain than Noo Joisey. A nice touch. The shocking, hairy AJ (which Paulie calls "Van Helsing" at one point) has a beautiful scene with his old comatose. The best time is that big boys try to talk about life without Tony, which immediately turns into a territorial dispute. Vito says Gene, who has died, may have been a case in the closet, which is interesting in the light of what we are about to learn about Vito.
