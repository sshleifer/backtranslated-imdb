In the colonies we are not as familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this movie (which had his preview of TCM recently) because of the negative comments here in his appearance on "Ghost Train" - which I expected to be completely annoying. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to see myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his time while delivering a speech suggest what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no way to compare him to Bud Abbott or any of the usual comic relief providers that appear in such films. One can also feel the thread that links Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from the American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts here. As for the rest of the movie - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you are to guess the ending, but it's still quite fun and atmospheric and worth the wait for the next appearance.
