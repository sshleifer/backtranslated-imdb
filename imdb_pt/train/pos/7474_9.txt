This is one of those movies difficult to analyze without revealing the plot. Suffice it to say that there are strange things and unexpected twists, in addition to the initial superficial plot of "Tom Cruise with several women around bolts". <br /> <br /> The cast of quality elevates this film above the norm, and the whole cast is well suited to its parts: Cruise as the presumptuous and annoying playboy who has it all - and then loses everything, Diaz as the attractive , but a little abandoned abandoned lover, Cross as the exotic new girl on the scene and Russell as the paternal psychologist. The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and science fiction and is usually a fun trip. <br /> <br /> I must add that photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful when you realize what is happening. <br /> <br /> If you like successful films with twists and suspense, and are prepared to accept a somewhat fantastic resolution of the Philip K Dick style, then it is a must see. <br /> <br /> 9/10
