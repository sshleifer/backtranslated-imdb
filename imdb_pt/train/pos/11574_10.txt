This movie is a half-documentary ... and it's very interesting .... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... based on the true story of how a bunch of Norwegian saboteurs managed to stop heavy water production in Rukjan, Norway and the delivery of the rest of the heavy water to Germany. <br /> <br /> This movie is not perfect and could have been a little better ... the best part of the movie is that some of the saboteurs are played alone !!! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in WWII history and film, this is a movie worth checking out !!
