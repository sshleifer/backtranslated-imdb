This movie was better than the ordinary action movie and in that sense they were successful. This film has had a spectacular cinematography with snow and spectacular mountain heights, a very fit Stallone also performing well, an exciting plot and great performance from its main villain because he will really bump into his wicked ways. The film does not rate a great time because of the weak screen play.The story and story cries for this film to make Stallone an extra special human being, much like the characters from the movie Rambo or Rocky or Bond. They chose to humanize the character of Stallone in that which is good, but considering the style of the plot, weakens the excitement factor. In addition, the dialogue was tacky and carelessly condescending at times. The script should have been more realistic and less talky. Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes. The filmmakers should have been more careful as they had the shooting successes and misses. They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the footage during the hijacking of the plane at the beginning of the film. Instead, they decided to wet a lot of shooting sequences (ala "A-Team" TV series) as soon as the villains put their feet in this movie had great potential for all time. Action sequences, better dialogue, and more Rambo / Rocky Stallone's emotion / determination would have taken this film to a higher level. I know this was not Stallone's fault. Feel the director of the film wanting to soften the character of Stallone and try to steal the film, taking the credit for his direction, which was not so good, were it not for his director of photography. Even so, a good movie ........
