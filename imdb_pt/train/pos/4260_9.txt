After Fatih Akins first work "Im Juli" which was pretty good, he created an epic of the really beautiful Italian family. It is a German film, which unfortunately is a bad precondition, because we rarely produce movies more than moderate;). But this movie makes some good snapshots of the time. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant who arrives in the "Ruhr" region of Germany during the 1960s. The immigrant and his family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellent designed. Especially Gigi, the lead actor. You live every second, every feeling he makes. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not so good. Well, you just do not believe him in the role. But the character is well balanced and fits perfectly in this script. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this film with the style of "The Godfather." Many people will probably hate this movie, let's just say it's boring. Not too tight? - Yes, but a scandalous movie. 9 out of 10.
