I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how the talented Melissa Joan Hart is. We are so used to seeing her now on a sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie soon, just as it will show Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama. Seen as we saw her on Sabrina now for 5 years and then giving viewers a taste of her unused talent would be an advantage. Melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents to "finish" so she can be with the guy she loves. One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice, Melissa works with David Lascher on it, well before taking on the role of Josh in Sabrina. So, it would be nice to see this currently whenever it is displayed again. I hope MJH has good roles in movies or even more TV movies, something like Kellie Martin, who has always shone on TV Movies. Lots of unused talents waiting to be eliminated when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart, you always shine Melissa !!!
