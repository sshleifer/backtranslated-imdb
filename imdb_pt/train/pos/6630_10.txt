This is an important movie. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There is much to like here. The director seems interested in dismantling some of the more tired film conventions. Unlike many recent American films, this film is interested in what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD includes many bonus features, and there are two comments that explain the movie to viewers still confused after an initial preview. When the film was shown at Sundance, it left more than a few members of the audience uncomfortable and angry. This is a Sunday morning coffee movie, not a Friday night party movie. For the dedicated viewer, it is a treasure.
