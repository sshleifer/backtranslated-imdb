As an official of the Swedish Air Force, I took the Gripen and Hkp 9 flight scenes (MBB Bo 105) in this film. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 jammer capsule, in this case an Rb 75 (Maverick) inert missile painted black with the letters "EWS 39" blank on the side. Real definitely jammets definitely did not look like this, at least not the ones I saw. <br /> <br /> But in addition, it's a fun movie with a very fun ending (the last minute). Anyone interested in seeing several Swedish military units, including the now legendary SSG, on film, should see this. <br /> <br />
