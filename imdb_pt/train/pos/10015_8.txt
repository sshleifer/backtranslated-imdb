Famous radio storyteller Gabriel Nobody (Robin Williams, snappy and hypnotic and hypnotic speaking) becomes familiar with a 14-year-old Wisconsin boy named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin) who wrote a book detailing sexual abuse of his parents. To begin with, Pete has AIDS and this forces Gabriel even more, since his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, good) is an HIV survivor. <br /> <br /> He also gets acquainted with Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides to meet and talk to them both personally and goes to Wisconsin, he discovers some secrets which he (of course) was not prepared to find. <br /> <br /> Based on the real facts that happened to Armistead Maupin (who co-wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and directed by Patrick Stetner, this movie moves much faster (90 minutes, maybe a few minutes more ) than one would think a film of this genre would. This is good because it keeps the action and storyline clear and crisp. It is bad because it leaves several holes in the plot and does not repair any of the openings or background stories. I'd rather not go into detail except to say that if you're not familiar with Mr. Maupin's work or your personal history, you feel a little out of the loop here. Still, Williams' performances (I'd love to hear more from her narration, personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and much of the support cast (Donette's waitress attends Collette's restaurant does a great job with the small part she has !) are high-level and the weather set here - namely, the cold, lonely, dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York - give a great setting for this story. It may have purposes that do not match particularly well, but it's still a convincing enough story to stay.
