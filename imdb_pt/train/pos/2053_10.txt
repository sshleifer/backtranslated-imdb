First of all, I would like to say that this movie was more than any other recent crap Hollywood has produced in its guts. McBain is a true action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements of an action movie of the 80s and early 90s ... the gratuitous random acts of violence (when Walken and the team come in to confront the traffickers to get money, they just show up and kill them. instead of letting them live and just getting their money), the thumping of their necks, the guys on fire, the guys being yanked out of buildings, and of course the guys who are on fire being yanked from the buildings. Walken is at his best in this photo, delivering memorable lines like "let's sit ... on the deck". and others that make this movie a great purchase from the settlement rack at the local video store. If you have a blood thirst for unnecessary random acts of violence, rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
