The Secret Fury, in many ways a common romantic thriller (directed by Mel Ferrer) features top directors in Colbert and Ryan; remains intriguing, if not very exciting, to the end, when implausibility gains suspension of disbelief - as so often happens in this genre. But for some viewers, the highlight of the film will be the portrait of Vivian Vance's Leah - the immortal Ethel Mertz in "I Love Lucy." Oddly, Vance had very few roles in the movies; Her real home was Broadway, where (among other shows) she studied for Ethel Merman. Here she contributes as a bribe maid to play a minor role in a nefarious scheme; watch her unenthusiastically trying to fend off the smoke as she is sneaking a sneaky cigarette into the hotel's bedding storage room - a transgression for which she finally pays the ultimate penalty.
