Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives an impressive performance of a declining actress, dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, personified by the specter of death of a young girl. Acceptance of oneself, of the human condition, despite its general difficulties, is the true purpose of the film. The parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself is intriguing: it's as if the stage has become a way out for heroin. If all American movies could only be of high quality, dealing with human relations on an adult level, not trying to infantilize and standardize the feelings ... One of the best dramas of all time. 10/10.
