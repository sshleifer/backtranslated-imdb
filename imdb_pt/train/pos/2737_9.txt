The film was thrilling from start to finish and its black and white photograph of America's heart is impressive. We feel we are right there with them as they cross the great country of heaven and then to Mexico and back to America again. Near the end of the film, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like little rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face. In the end, we followed them up the ladder to the final moment. <br /> <br /> The two criminals, played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, such as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, could be seen on any street in any city. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with the stars in his eyes on the wrong side of town. This point is made in the film and it always surprises us that criminals do not look different than anyone else. Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition. These two delirious men kill a whole family, looking for a safe that is not there. Once on the run, they begin writing bottomless checks, clearing the way for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many good supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as the case's detective, Alvin Dewey. In addition, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as a promoter. <br /> <br /> I've always wanted to see this movie to the end, having only caught on small snippets; I finally got it after buying the DVD. The result is the best classic crime movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this brilliant movie. For me, this is what a great film production is.
