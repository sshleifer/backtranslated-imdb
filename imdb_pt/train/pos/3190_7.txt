This is his standard 30's musical comedy, with a great advantage that features some well-known actors of the 30's in small and funny co-stars. <br /> <br /> There is not much to the story and basically the film is all about its fun and 'no-worries' global type of atmosphere, with a typical Hal Roach comedy twist to it. Apparently it's a 'Cinderella story', but I certainly did not think of it that way while watching the movie. The story gets very confused in the narrative, which features many different characters and also a small appearance when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course the highlight of the film is when Laurel & Hardy makes his appearance and shows some of his routines. It's like watching a movie and winning a Laurel & Hardy short for free. Also regular Laurel and Hardy Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as the director of the short. <br /> <br /> It is certainly true that all appearances and subplots distract from the main plot and character, but in this case this is no problem since it is much more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot and the typical main character shallow. <br /> <br /> The film is most certainly not worse than any other genre film of the same time period, although the rating here suggests otherwise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
