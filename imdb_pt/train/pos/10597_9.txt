I recommend images that try something different. A lot of movies look like clipping of old ideas, so that's the big reason why I strongly recommend Passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The film is set after the Second World War and the lack of post-war and rationing seems to be driving "barmy" Londoners. The film is centered on a tiny neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They are also tired of not being able to buy what they want, but they can not see any way out. That's until they accidentally come across a hidden treasure and a letter that officially named this neighborhood as a sovereign nation many hundreds of years ago! With this document, they reason, they can ignore all rationing and coupons and live life exactly as they want, since they really are not British subjects! Where the film goes from there and how the crisis is finally settled is something you need to see for yourself. Let the brilliant minds of Ealing Studios create this jewel!
