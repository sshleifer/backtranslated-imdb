This short and entertaining 1916 film - time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in the comedy - shows the young Oliver Hardy as a madman who has to quickly impress his rich uncle, producing a wife and baby for his visit. <br /> <br /> Of course this does not happen without problems and soon there are more wives and babies than he can handle; as well as the pursuits and mandatory misunderstandings that are the trademark of the slapstick from the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Restored well, it can be seen as part of "Oliver Hardy's First Movies" and is now available on DVD, a nice addition to the corpus available of the favorite comedy duo big screen.
