After losing the Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose on the TV version of GYPSY, Bette won an Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert filmed especially for HBO in Las Vegas. Midler, who has been performing live on stage since the 1970s, proves she is still one of the most electrifying artists in the business. From her opening number, her classic "Friends", where she descends from wings over a beautiful cloud, Bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a number called "I Look Good", she proves she has a way with a joke like some other artists in this business as she goes her way through a variety of musical selections. The section of the show in which she greets burlesque goes a little too much, but she manages to incorporate her old jokes Sophie Tucker here to advantage (although she actually forgets a joke in the middle of counting her, but she ad-libbing until she remembers which is hysterical). Bette also deals with GYPSY's "Rose's Turn" and the title song of her movie THE ROSE, as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She brings the house near the end with "ROSE WITH ME, BABY" from THE ROSE and her only hit # 1, "Wind Beneath My Wings" from BEACHES. It's a dazzling night of musical comedy entertainment and for Midler fans, it's a must.
