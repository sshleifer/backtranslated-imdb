I must admit first that I'm a huge fan of The Dandy Warhols, and that's why I came to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The uniqueness of this film, compared to other modern rockumentaries, is that it's not just about a page in a band's history (like "I'm Trying to Break Your Heart" about Wilco), but it covers one long period of the history of the band. In this film, director / producer Ondi Timoner followed closely the friends / rivals The Brianjestown Massacre (BJM) and The Dandy Warhols (DW) for over 8 years (1995-2003) and recorded 1500 hours of raw video, cut 1:45 pm (the future release on DVD will contain much more material than the original film). The result is surprising - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and genuine, which gives you the feeling that the film has progressed with the bands over the years. <br /> <br /> Both bands early in their careers promised to "make a revolution" in music production, not sell their souls to the devil of the "music industry." However, their paths quickly diverged - The Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively popular (especially in Europe) after just one album, while the Brian Jonestown Massacre (with its self-defeating leader Anton Newcombe) dissolved into oblivion (at least as it is portrayed in the film). And the film follows the descent of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, in contrast to the rise of The Dandy Warhols. <br /> <br /> First, I was thrilled with the film and its approach to telling the story of Anton Newcombe (for example, Courtney Taylor - the leader of The Dandy Warhols - narrates), but after thinking, I realized something is wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> First, treat Anton Newcombe as a missing person. The project began in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups, in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners (this was the reason why all those years Ondi Timoner had immediate access to both bands). It was Anton Newcombe who brought The Dandy Warhols to the project. In the end, he was completely ignored, as if he had been kicked out of the project. Everyone talks about BJM, but he does not participate in the discussion. I guess he was not even informed when the group started the final editing process. There are always two sides to the story, and here we have only one ... Of course, as you would expect, Anton does not approve the end result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his old friends. <br /> Second, the film is very biased with Dandy Warhols. Of course, the winner takes everything, but the fact that Courtney Taylor (DW leader) narrates (though it seems a good choice - provides a seemingly narrower sense of involvement) and that the recent history of the bands is represented in a non-proportional way (BJM is covered until 1997, and DW - until 2003), does not add objectivity to the film. <br /> <br /> Third, the film is (somewhat) superficial. What do you want to teach us? As one critic put it: "... the film examines old questions: where does genius fit into a commodified world? Can it thrive and win, or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity?" No, DO NOT EXAMINE these questions! It merely portrays the story of a brilliant but unsuccessful musician narrated by a less brilliant but successful one who gives himself up to self-confidence and the eternal coolness of an ego greater than the mountain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie was fun - it's raw, it's fresh, it's stylish, it's just ... it's very interesting, at least for fans of DW or BJM. For the rest of the crowd - I do not know ...
