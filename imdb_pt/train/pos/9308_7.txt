If you're used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles as Tom at Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects, I recommend you take a look at this movie. Even if you're not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular, all the actors in this movie give great performances. If you have about eleven dollars (that's close to nine pounds) I say to order online, or rent it from your favorite movie rental place. Guaranteed to make you laugh if you usually like gangster movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies that you never forget and see yourself over and over again. You will talk about it so much that your friends will be begging to borrow.
