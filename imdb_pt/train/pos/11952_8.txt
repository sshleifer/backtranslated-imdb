Scoop *** out of **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed "Match Point". It was an excellent romantic thriller that luckily did not star in Woody Allen. He had the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest movie and although it does appear on this, it's okay. He also has Scarlett Johansson and the two work together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist who takes a lifetime from the ghost of Joe Strombel (Ian McShane). Joe heard the hole while he was in a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls that the Reaper took. One such soul is Peter Lyman's secretary (Hugh Jackman). She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer wandering the streets of England. Joe, with the bore of life, travels back to the living and gives this information to Sondra during a magical act. Sondra is on some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen). She volunteers to go into a vanishing box and while she's in the box, she gets Joe's visit. Not knowing what to do, she asks for Sid Waterman's help to help her figure out the case. <br /> <br /> This movie has a cheerful atmosphere compared to "Match Point" and yet everything works. Johansson and Allen work very well together. Allen's mood fits perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is fantastic as Peter Layman, the "suspect" serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is a fun little movie to see if you are looking for one to watch. The cast works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that you are watching Woody Allen himself. I say give it a try because you might like it.
