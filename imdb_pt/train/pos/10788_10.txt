Big Rock Candy Mountain is incredible. I watched it when I was little, and I still do it today (in high school). If I could imagine heaven, that's how it would be. I wish I could live on the great mountain of rock candy where candy grows on trees. Zach Hyman is a teacher and my best friend. Bunny foo foo is the man. It's so confusing and colorful that I dream about it at night. in fact, my 18-year-old friend attended for the first time and loved it. I recommend people of all ages watch this movie. I'm having a great party this weekend with all my friends to watch this amazing movie. Let's order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggling. I constantly find myself watching clouds and wishing that I were the little girl I had to visit. thank you. bye.
