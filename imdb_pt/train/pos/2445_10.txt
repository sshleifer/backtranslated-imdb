I really like this show. That's why I was disappointed to learn recently that George Lopez is a racist, and that he dismissed Masiela Lusha from the show, simply because he discovered she was not a Latin emigrant, but she was an emigrant from Albania. I learned this from the people on the show. It was really one of the best parts of the show, and so learn that even among those you would think would be sensitive to racism, that they may also hate someone, just because of the country where they were born, is really disappointing.
