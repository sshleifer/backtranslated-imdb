I'm a big fan of John Denver. I have a great collection of your vinyl music. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and I loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and then release. The later release is missing several songs though. I see it was released this year with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale for $ 75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas CD would be worth a lot. For me, it is not worth selling this treasure. It's my favorite Christmas CD. I've never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would love to have any version. If someone has one available, please let me know. thank you
