A continuation of Angels With Dirty Faces just by the name, The Angels Wash Their Faces suffers a little from the usual perils of the Dead End Kids. In fact, with the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, this should have been treated as a true continuation of Angels With Dirty Faces, at least because of the continuity. Speaking of Ann Sheridan, she's the only bright light in this movie. To paraphrase a clich√©, Ann Sheridan could read a phone book for two hours and I would buy the DVD! <br /> <br /> Another virtue of this film is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo, I recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
