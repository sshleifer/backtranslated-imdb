I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black artists ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson , Stepin Fetchit (nonetheless) Louis Armstrong and the showgirls are out of the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. It's true ... stereotypes are there, but it was so ... and these designs were made for adult entertainment at the local cinema before the main movie. Harmann & Ising cartoons tend to be more "cute" and more sophisticated, (after all ... we're talking about MGM) than the standard animated short film made at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or humble Columbia. Even Disney's Mickey Mouse had a lot of humor before Uncle Walt cleaned it right before he got into Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Disney also had some cartoon cartoons of black artists ... for example, 1937's Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. In 50 years, clips from the Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park will also be screened, analyzed and even smeared by future viewers.
