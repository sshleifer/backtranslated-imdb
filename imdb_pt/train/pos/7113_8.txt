Being from the suburbs of Philadelphia and extremely interested in local history, this film offers a great vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes from downtown, a no-longer-existing train station, 30th Street Station - which still exists, as well as scenes from the northeastern part of the city. Good pictures of the old row houses when they showed up. The film gets a little "chatty" sometimes - making the viewer quickly lose interest ... but the overall plot is solid and very touching. Those who liked this movie should also try to see the movie "Bright Victory," also featuring local footage from Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville. Army Hospital has since become a university campus. None of these movies are in any format and I can not imagine why. I have the two in VHS recording at home, as shown in TCM in recent years. I highly recommend them to any other history fans out there in my area!
