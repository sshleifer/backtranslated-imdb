I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this painter that I had never heard of before. So I started exploring his life and working afterwards. Predictably, I discovered that the film was not exactly accurate historically. I was a bit surprised, however, by the very negative comments about the film because of this inaccuracy. Come on, folks, a movie is not and should not be a biography (not even a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art by itself. A filmmaker has every right to use elements of reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a wonderful film and I think it has brought many people (including some who now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
