This is what I call the movie "Pre Sci Fi; Sci Fi". There is nothing better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good "humor" type movie. These two genuine artists are at their best as well as the plot. <br /> <br /> Karloff does an incredible job as a scientist who finds himself engrossed in a glimpse of vanity, pride, and scientific competition. I was caught in the idea of ​​watching a man as he drowns in the three concepts mentioned earlier. I was sad and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as themselves. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that begs for a remake. This time, he placed Harrison Ford in the part of Karloff and perhaps Kieffer Sutherland as the role of Bela Lagosi. It may be possible to do this almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Hollywood has ever produced. Like I said ... it does not get any better. No way.
