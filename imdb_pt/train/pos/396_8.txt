Legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember well the original Tsu Hark Zu Warriors made 18 years earlier. On a Christmas in a rare week in which Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong movies, Zu Warriors was so exciting for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it was etched in the memory of the now grown In fact, I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the first movies I saw as a child, which I can clearly remember from the story and the action scenes. And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classic heyday. <br /> <br /> So when I saw this remake of Zu Warriors, there was a sense of apprehension. Could you beat up the dreamy childhood memories I had of the original, or follow the path of other remakes and die a more horrible death than the bad guys and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies? <br /> Well, the answer is I can not say. But that was because this is not really a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different. Zu's Legend tells the story of Sky King, a solitary warrior whose master, Dawn, declares his love for him, but his life is taken from her by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later, Insomnia returns, Dawn is reincarnated as Enigma, and Insomnia returned to destroy Zu. Meanwhile, White Eyebrows and Red try, with the help of Sky King, to stop insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plot is not full of twists, but it had enough detail to keep me interested. But I can see this movie as someone you love or hate. The film is a lot about special effects, with most involving various computer generated environments, much like The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this movie was one that did not exaggerate the graphics and the whole thing was in good taste. Nothing seems rushed - unlike the hero. The scenarios were complementary to the performance and did not dominate the scenes. <br /> <br /> The story also involves many characters and the mix of so many people makes the movie intriguing. It was possibly on the brink of 'many cooks', but generally each character had its share in the story. But some of the roles seem to be 'prolonged appearances' in my opinion, and somehow I have to lightly question the need for it. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play very central roles in the film, but I could not say that this movie showed its best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems at least to have matured in her acting, but is still quite raw. Kelly Lin was the new revelation to me. Despite his very short role, I apologize and admit greed! <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say, I liked this movie as much as I liked the 'original'. Given that both films are made by the legendary Tsui Hark, the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how cinema in Hong Kong has changed over two decades. And a beauty of this is the fact that you can not really compare the two films as much as apples are apples and pears are pears. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own films. right. And I'm going back to reminiscing watching the original again. <br /> <br /> Two to watch but not compare.
