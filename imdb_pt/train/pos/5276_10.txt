I joined IMDb so people know what a great movie this is! It is not always that you are faced with a movie that is moving and visually cinematic but humble. You read the plot, so all I want to say is do not watch it because you want to see a shock of cultural religious identity babble because that's the typical misconception that people read, instead just enjoy it and realize it's about a father and son on a growing journey to get to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it before film4 back to it. This was one of the few films to be nominated for an independent and foreign BAFTA. The beauty of this is that it manages to attract anyone even if you never see anything with subtitles or just use the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you involved. The only thing I want is for it to be longer and see what happens
