"Foxes" is a serious look at the aftermath of growing too fast in the 1980s. And unlike the adolescent sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times in Ridgemount High), the film holds up well against time. <br /> <br /> Your teenage angst theme is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago. and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (remember him?) lead a young and handsome cast that is worth watching. <br /> <br /> The film follows four girls from Southern California as they move through a sexless, drug-free existence and devoid of parents. Teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, shows or on the street. Rarely are they at home because instant gratification is a pill, a party or a boy away. <br /> <br /> But instead of condemning them, the film is nice, blaming absent and indifferent adults for forcing teens to grow up on their own. And the charismatic cast is impossible not to like. <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie? a long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows. We see the girls asleep at dawn amid the objects that define teenage childhood, from Twinkies to a photo of a young John Travola, while Donna Summer "On the Radio" is punctuated below. <br /> <br /> From there the film gains speed as the girls go to school and to life. Annie (fledgling rocker, Cherie Currie) is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is the queen of the boy's crazy drama. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is the shy girl in her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It's your job to keep this team long enough to finish high school, at the same time keeping her divorced and desperate by hunting her mother in line (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> It's a near impossible job and Foster finally fails. Despite his age, "Foxes" remains a pleasure to watch. Dated hair, clothes and references to Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill did not hurt the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply breathtaking, with breathtaking photos of the Los Angeles basin at dawn, dusk and night. Giorgio Moroder adds an 80's soundtrack with names like Donna Summer and Janis Ian. Perhaps the film's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around Foster have never burst out like the cast of St. Elmo's Fire. 1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should have. But, maybe like the 1985 "Bowling for Soup" song, they just hit a wall.
