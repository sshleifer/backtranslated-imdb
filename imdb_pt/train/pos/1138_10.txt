When I was 8 years old, I always watched movies and television shows that I should not, and that was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it has to be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, the acting is great, they do not do comedies like this anymore in the days of today (movies that are REALLY funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some kind of vomit-inducing body fluid, as in those retarded films by Judd Apatow starring unhappy non-actors such as Seth Rogen, vomiting). <br /> <br /> This film is a classic with actors who can really act and deserve all the praise.
