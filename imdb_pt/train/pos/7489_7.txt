This movie has many strengths. He has one of the best horror castles out of Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney's circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, as well as leader Melvyn Douglas. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone staircases, a crazy scientist, city people waving torches and hunting vampires, an Igor character, a cute girl, even a goofy Burgomeister. The work of the soft focus camera is unstable and imaginative. There is even good comic relief well spaced throughout the script. <br /> <br /> But it's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in "Kleinschloss" ("little castle"). The plot revolves around the generic mad scientist (well interpreted by Atwill) who values ​​his work more than human lives. <br /> <br /> It's not top notch stuff, because of a ho-hum plot resolution and some embarrassingly bad dialogue for Dwight Frye. But it's worth taking a look if you like old horror photos.
