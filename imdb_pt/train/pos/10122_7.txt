I found this a bit difficult to follow, as it seemed to plunge in the middle, while I tried to make face or crown who was fighting with whom and why. One of the problems is cultural / language. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem, of which we know little and because we are simply reading subtitles in English, we inevitably lose some of the subtleties. Another problem is that it seems that there are just too many just half of the twists and turns. However, it seems unlikely that there is a totally bad Miiki movie and that's certainly not it. Plenty of stylish and violent violence, a window into some less orthodox sexual events, plus the familiar aspect. All in all a decent tour but maybe checking out the plot can really be helpful before watching this.
