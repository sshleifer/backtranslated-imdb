Another of those movies you hear about friends (... or read about IMDb). There are not many false notes in this. I could see almost everything here really happening to a young woman fleeing from a hometown with no way out in Tennessee to Florida, with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten up car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, makes some false starts, but learns from them. I caught myself wondering why, why she did not lean a little more on Mike's shoulder, but ... she has her reasons, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> Just a great movie. The one thing I do not like much about this, I guess, is the title.
