First of all, the Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. Good combination of strange 'dogma' style of telling the story along with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no 'end'. As for me, it is unacceptable. I was wondering ... how can you continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure the third part without Helmer would not be the same. So here is my suggestion. Mayble little stupid, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. So why not do a little experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create animations driven by dolls (such as "Team America" ​​by Trey Parker) or even 3D animations. I know it's not the same as real actors, but in principle I believe it could work ... only this way it is possible to reactivate the actors. For Riget fans, this should not be such a big difference - if the animation is done in a good way, the average 'observer' will consider it normal right after the first takes of the film. The most important thing is the story now. It is completely understandable that it is not possible to create Riget 3 with the actors nowadays. So why not play with animation? And ... look for the possibilities this gives you! Even a marketing! Great director ends his trilogy after 10 years using doll animation. Just dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Riget 3 someday ... or even just see the script. I'm curious how the story ends ... and how I expect it - everyone here does. <br /> <br /> greets, slaj <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about the "kingdom hospital" by Stephen King ;-)
