I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, the one I saw about 2 years ago and it really drives me crazy. I've never seen anything so sick and distorted before. The story is good and the actors act very well. I have not seen the UK or Japan version, but I must say that I believe the German DVD is a bit censored. If you have not yet seen the film and live in Germany, it may be best to look for a DVD from Nederlands or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes, but at the showdown I felt something was missing, about one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> In short, a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what I like Miike !!
