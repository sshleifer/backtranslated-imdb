"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" has been shrouded in controversy before it aired, and this controversy may obscure the making of the film. Those who criticized the film, which they had not seen, did so, with good intentions, based on the mistaken thought that it would be overly sympathetic to Hitler. However, they misunderstood the point: to humanize evil, Hitler does not sympathize with him. It is much more disturbing to realize that the unspeakable acts committed by one of the greatest villains in history were committed by a human being. A sick maniac, sick, sure, but a human being, though. It is necessary to know the story of how Hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again. <br /> <br /> "Rise of Evil" is highlighted by a brilliant and better career performance of Robert Carlyle, who makes Hitler a human being without ever redeeming it in any way. Carlyle perfectly captures the look and mannerisms of the Nazi leader while never letting the impersonation become caricatured or distancing us (something that Anthony Hopkins was not able to accomplish when he portrayed Hitler in "The Bunker," another very good made for the television movie) . While they were repelled by Hitler's depravity and virulent anti-Semitism, Carlyle gives him a certain magnetism and power that the true Adolf Hitler must have possessed. After all, how else would a nation follow him? From the various subplots, by far the most convincing features of Matthew Modine as the reporter Fritz Gehrlich, who makes the work of his life draw attention to reality. of Hitler and Nazism. While Modine's performance is somewhat affected in part 1, by part 2 he seems to have settled down, the character gives us a real-life hero in a movie full of villains. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also give strong support. <br /> <br /> Part 1 of this two-part miniseries has suffered somewhat from being overly volatile, including a look at Hitler's childhood that lasts only the duration of the opening. credits. And in Part 2, sections detailing Hitler's relationship with his niece, and his mistress Eva Braun, are less successful than the central plot, but serve to give us a deeper insight into his mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, no film about Hitler can make us understand him. The average person is fortunately unable to understand a man who would try to exterminate an entire race of people. "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" tries less to make us understand Hitler, and more to make us understand how he came to be power. It is an important story that must be told, and it is impossible to believe that anyone who has seen the movie would accuse her of having anything but the best of intentions and the ability to do anything but good. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10. *** 1/2
