Paul Reiser did a spectacular job writing this movie. Peter Falk gives the performance of his life. It's worthy of an Oscar. This was one of the most pungent and funny movies of the year. Reiser's wit is fantastic and he is as good as possible and as he was in his long TV series "Mad about You". Peter Falk did a masterful job as his father, and Peter, who is now 78, made us laugh and cry at the same time. The supporting cast was just like the task, especially the beautiful and beautiful Elizabeth Perkins. It's a must-see movie for 2005. We bet that everyone of all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie. We all had good and bad times together and we wanted things to be the same, but different.
