I really think I should make my case and have every (horror and cult) movie fan go and see this movie ... <br /> <br /> I did! <br /> <br /> -Excellent: Very atmospheric and unsettling and scary ... <br /> <br /> Incredible how could they make such a jewel of a movie with the very low (read "no"!) - budget they had ... Synopsis taken from the site: "One morning, an old man enters the forest in search of his fugitive cat. He finds a child without parents and a murder without a corpse ..." /> In this site (IMDb) there is no trailer, but I will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself, where there is a trailer that is quite disturbing so please go and check it out. ..www.softfordigging.com
