I try to watch every day most of the time, and even though I have watched the last 4 years, I have not seen all the episodes. <br /> <br /> The Show is about Danny Tanner, who is a guy who does sports news. His wife is killed by a car accident of a drunk driver and he asks Jesse, an Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession with his hair. Joey, an adult comedian who plays cartoon voices all the time to take care of his three girls, Donna Joe, they call him DJ, Stephinie who is the second oldest and Michelle the younger. <br /> Everyone lives under the same roof, with no one to help them. Later in the show, Jesse receives a girlfriend and then is married to her and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (this starts to happen in the new seasons) This show is amazing, if you like the life of Zack and Cody's Suite, This is so Raven, Boy Meets world, and Designing Woman, you will love it. (It starts to get better in the final seasons) Watch, you'll love it!
