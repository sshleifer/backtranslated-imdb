This movie is simply brilliant. The cinematography is good, the performance superb and the story absolutely stunning. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who considered himself liberal until he discovered the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on TV a few years later, I recognized him for Kline's portrait. Denzel Washington also has a masterful performance, as always. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch this. It's long, but it's worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, guys, this really happened.
