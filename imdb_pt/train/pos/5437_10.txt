Pandro S. Berman was "in charge of production", but this made him the so-called Line Producer. But who produced this epic, filmed not in Arizona, but in the Mohave Desert, California, where scavengers carried all traces of the "golden temple," Thuggee huts, the British post in Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. minor technical failures can and should be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for better music, though perhaps the Academy did not offer such a thing back then. A single theme was played at various times, including waltz, marching and sweet, ambiance. Bright! One of the curious aspects of the production was the demands of the widow Kipling. An actor who plays Kipling briefly appears before and after the battle scenes. At the initial release, her scenes were cut, as per the requirements of Mrs. Kipling. Later, they were included and lent a "connection" to Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's screenplay. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story was from a great screenwriter who hated the British.
