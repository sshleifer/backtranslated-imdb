Two workers in confrontation in a leather goods store end up becoming secret girlfriends, since they correspond to nicknames of box number. Within this simple idea and an everyday scenario, Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of humor, drama, pungency and irony that never ceases to exist. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own subplots and inner jokes. Although mistakenly eclipsed by Stewart's great films of 39/40 (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Mr Smith), this is easily egalitarian and we enjoy a whole range of subtleties of performance unheard of in other films.
