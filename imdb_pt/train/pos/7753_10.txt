This Belgian film, directed by Tom Barman, singer of the well known dEUS group, will not be favored by all. For the simple reason that there is not a clear story or even a plot. This film shows only 24 hours in "a city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to truly watch and enjoy the dialogues, the direction, the humorous (Dario !, osteopath Bruno !, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...) characters. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: the Windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, KISS-fan, Windman visits the osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Clearly some other viewers did not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no history, etc. But it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching and this will drag you into it. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched yet, be sure to listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary as Tom Barman and his group dEUS. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mondje dicht h√©." (do not tell anyone)
