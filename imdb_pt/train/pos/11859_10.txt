In the cradles of MTV, all the participants and shooters take the classic Scarface movie from their DVD collection. This may give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Of course, there are gangsters and mobs, but that's not Scarface's point. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban refuge in search of a new lifestyle. He falls with the mob group and becomes a known trafficker. Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is what always comes to mind when I think of the Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface. This falls into my top 10 favorite movies. I would rate *** *** 1/2 (out of ****). Definitely a movie you should see. PHENOMENAL.
