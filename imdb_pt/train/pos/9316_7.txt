Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who assumes a criminal case in "The Unknown Man," a 1951 film also starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man, Rudi Walchek (Braselle) accused of murder and acquits him. Shortly after, he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim, as well as from other neighborhood shopkeepers. He is advised by DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is a small change, that to end organized crime, we must find the superior man. Mason meets the top man, and faces a dilemma. "The Unknown Man" is a small black-and-white film that manages to keep the viewer's interest in its various twists, although the plot is somewhat artificial. It is really the story of a good man seeking his god, justice and what he is willing to do to reach it. And that's the most planned part of all. I suppose there was a time before O.J., the Menendez brothers, etc., etc., when people believed in the justice and integrity of the lawyers. For this spectator anyway, those days are past. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his beautiful, elegant, declamatory voice shows us a confident, successful man, but also deeply affectionate. Pidgeon had a magnificent career of 60 years but never made it to stardom. He was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did. It may be because by the time he was receiving nominations, he was in his thirties and missed being a matinee idol; or it could be that he was not sure of anything; or that it was typed early on as the second cause of a great female star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives an honest and touching performance here. <br /> <br /> Very good movie with good performances.
