Better than the typical TV movie, INVITATION TO HELL is blessed with an excellent cast (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Joe Brown Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a high-concept update to the familiar plot of Faustian. . Urich is as nice as ever and Lucci is particularly attractive and diabolically exaggerated in the mother of all roles of femme fatale. A kind of hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film commits itself early on with its apocalyptic miltonesca vision and horror fans will probably not have many complaints until the nauseous and mushy. 7/10
