Last year, we were presented with two films about Truman Capote writing the book from which this film was made - Capote and Infame. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine a movie like this being made in 1967. An austere, powerful movie and terrifyingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of classic film by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Professional, Blackboard Jungle). <br /> <br /> It's interesting that Robert Blake, who starred in this movie, has had so many problems lately that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that stays with you after watching.
