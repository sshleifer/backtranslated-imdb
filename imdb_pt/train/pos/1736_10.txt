Look, this is possibly one of the best movies that America has to offer the rest of the world. Hating this movie is hating freedom itself. I remember that the early 1980s was a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. Out of that confusion came a hero, Stroker Ace. Ned Beatty's performance in this film showed that he would never again be called a one-dimensional victim in the desert. Your triumph is an inspiration to all. The on-screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws obvious comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!
