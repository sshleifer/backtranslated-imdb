When I first heard about the title, I thought of 'The Simpsons' as well as so many other critics, but when I saw the cast, I was completely stunned that so many great character actors would actually be in it! First of all, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction), who plays the title character, McBain. He is rescued from a Vietnam prisoner of war camp by some of his friends, one of whom is Santos (Chick Vennera, Yankees), who divides a dollar bill with McBain (Vietnam soldiers are apparently with money) and says he can go back and do him a favor, if he ever gets in trouble. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2) join the rebels. in Colombia, trying to get rid of his evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails on the mission, Christina goes to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks his good old friends from Vietnam to help him. First, there's the tough-guy Eastland, played by Steve James of "American Ninja," who also starred in director James Glickenhaus's previous film, "The Exterminator," where the exterminator's real name was also Eastland, a coincidence? I think not. There are also many other references to the Terminator, among other things, the most notable of which is that McBain himself wears a welder's mask when Christina sees him for the first time when he's working on a welding job over a bridge! <br /> <br /> The other guys in the Vietnam-pack are: The rich guy who can afford all sorts of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and then there's the doc Dalton, (played by Jay Patterson, who does not look like the guy the IMDb is creating, and I have not seen him in other movies, so who knows), and last but not least, there's the cop, Gill, who has had enough of his unsatisfactory work, he is played by Thomas G. Waites, which some of us may remember The Warriors and The Thing. <br /> <br /> And in other major roles, we find Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way) as a small drug dealer who can not get a decent job. In addition, there is Dick Boccelli as the drug lord who hangs on a crane on top of a roof by the McBain gang, almost exactly the same way he hanged himself with a John Eastland meat grinder on the EXTERMINATOR-movie! Now, I have not seen Glickenhaus's "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop" yet, but I'm almost ready to wager a hundred-dollar bill that Boccelli also gets stuck in that movie! <br /> <br /> Well, back to the plot of this movie .. they depart for Colombia and save the day, yay! But who cares about the plot anyway, the cast is great, and the action scenes are very well done, and you never get bored while watching this movie! Highly recommended for all lovers of action!
