I just got through 45 minutes of ROLL fast. <br /> <br /> Roll is about an inland boy, Mat (Toby Malone) who dreams of becoming a Sports Star. Mat travels to the city and must be chosen by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery to him. Needless to say, Mat is dragged into George's world. <br /> <br /> I found it great how Mat teaches George about morals and respect while George teaches Mat to relax and enjoy life a little. Toby and Damien went well together and did a great job. <br /> <br /> Each character in the film greeted each other very well, both cops were great. David Ngoombujarra brought a great comic relief to the film. Tiny played a nice gangster who reminded me of one of my favorite characters 'Pando' from Two Hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things I liked about Roll was that it showed the cities that I grew up and lived for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see landscapes and landmarks with which I grew up, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
