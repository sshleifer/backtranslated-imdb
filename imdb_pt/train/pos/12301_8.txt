It's kind of crazy, but I recorded it from TCM, this German version of "Anna Christie" from MGM, and the English version ... but I could see that first, because I heard that a lot of people thought it was better than the English. <br /> <br /> Without having seen the other, I can not compare them, but, anyway, this is an excellent precocious talkie, with a direct performance of Garbo. She looks very pretty in this film, her face shines everywhere, especially when cameraman William Daniels gets those beautiful close-ups from her. The atmosphere of the film seems different from the ordinary things of MGM made at that time, it looks very similar to the French or German expressionist films of the 1930s, directed by a great French director, Monsieur Jacques Feyder, who had directed Garbo in 1929 in "The Kiss". Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolutely convincing performance as the love of Anna, the tough and tough sailor who is just a child in the man's body. Also Hans Junkermann does a very good performance, like the alcoholic father of Anna and Salka Viertel too, like a cheap and delicious old woman. <br /> <br /> In an entire experience because it is the only film in which you can listen to Garbo speaks in a foreign language ... because all the other films she did in Sweden or Germany were during the Era Silent. <br /> <br /> Flick.
