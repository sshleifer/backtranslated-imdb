I had watched the most of the series I could watch on television, but unfortunately, I started a job that gave me nights off work. I managed to get some recordings, at least ... and of course I bought the recently released DVD of the complete series. Watching the DVD, you can see that the animation was a bit brute at first, but they solved a good number of glitches after the pilot was done. The voices are well adapted to the characters and the writing is excellent. It's very exciting to see the animation going back to its roots, reintroducing adult themes. The point is, with the way society has arrived in the last century, you need to be a bit more obvious about it by today's standards in order to be recognized as an adult-oriented program. The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in parallel situations to what we often face in real life. It's your typical comedy about it, but the mood is more like what you'd expect from late-night television like a talk show or Saturday Night Live ... when SNL was really funny. Good work, Dreamworks. You may need to work with one of the more liberal networks to maintain this series ... and also improve merchandise marketing for the series to help pay for its high costs. It is a challenge to do this for a mature nature cartoon. Hmm ...
