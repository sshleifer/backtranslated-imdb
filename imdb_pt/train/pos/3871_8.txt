Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman living in an overcrowded Jewish ghetto in nineteenth-century England. It is surrounded by imposing, oppressive, gloomy, uncharacteristic, worn brick architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, darkened windows, and hordes of black and brown hooded crowds. <br /> <br /> She lives in a tiny apartment with her large family, who operates a clothing store inside the apartment. As a child, she worked, had no privacy, wore colorless clothing, shared a bed, and remained silent to avoid the mockery of her mother and siblings who ridiculed her for imitating them out of boredom. her life remains the same - she has no privacy, she lives in a state of mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and inertia, she exudes a expression that is expressionless and expressionless, she is dressed in simple and undignified clothes of note and is continually oppressed and overshadowed by gray, worldly and massively imposing buildings, and the narrow streets, narrow corridors, narrow doors, mother and siblings high-pitched and the mundane and mundane lifestyle of her family . <br /> Its only one form of mental escape is the Yiddish theater. Sitting on the porch, in the front row, leaning on the banister, there is a vast space between the mind and the stage, a space that allows you to breathe, think, feel and miss. <br /> <br /> However, despite the freedom of thought that the open stage provides Esther, her face and body remain awkwardly drowsy, impassive, impartial. <br /> <br /> The simple and common Summer Phoenix conveys brilliantly the emotionless behavior of Esther - Summer / Esther conveys no desire to want anything or anticipate anything. <br /> After an explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decides to free herself from the dark life in which she is in prison. <br /> <br /> She is eventually cast in smaller parts in some plays, and meets Nathan Quellen, played by British actor Ian Holm, who begins to teach Esther the technical ability to perform. <br /> <br /> From this point on, Esther begins a tiring double journey of learning how to act and learn to feel. <br /> <She begins to experience emotions she has never felt before, and begins to gain the experience she needs to understand and control the technical aspects of acting. Nathan leads her through the stage through the physical and emotional. steps of surprise, hesitation, anger, disgust, self-loathing, etc .; she then begins to go through these emotions in her personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three truths, Nathan tells her - the truth of how a character reacts, the truth of how the actor would react and the truth that a character and actor are not the same person. <br /> <br /> These technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct Esther's defenses and lead her to two uplifting experiences in the ending of the film that marks the beginning of her freedom of thought. , movement and emotion. <br /> Esther Kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of its strange, narrow photos, dull photo direction that conveys the ghetto's realistic and dull scenery, and the bland style of Summer Phoenix. an insipid and unpleasant portrait that brilliantly conveys Kahn's mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and lackluster nature. <br /> <br /> A must-see movie for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting, and for people who enjoy minimalist f ilms and character studies.
