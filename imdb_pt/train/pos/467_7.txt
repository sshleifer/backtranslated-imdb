This movie is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best. The setting is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film's photography is excellent, as are the acting of both Turturro and Watson. Turturro definitely gives his best performance to date, proving that he is worth much more than we thought. Watson also performs brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro) who is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is presented in a non-linear time, with several flashbacks from Luzhin's childhood. Through them, the complex character of Luzhin is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say, but I suggest this movie to anyone.
