For what it is, "Raise Victor Vargas" is as close to the perfection that a movie can achieve. Whether it's pure genius from an incipient author or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked (probably some of each), this simple, small, first-ever ethnic slice of urban slice shows your young characters so deeply you almost Can read their minds. The film begins with a strong "street" flavor but enters into a Latin family affair and then focuses on a story that tells volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the deeply natural desire to love each other. In my experience, it has never been done so much with so little (shooting cast, rookie director, etc.). Praised by critics, but not by all, "Raising Victor Vargas" is recommended for indie and realistic lovers in simple tales rich in humanity. (AN)
