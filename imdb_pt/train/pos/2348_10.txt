This show is fast, colorful, dark but fun, modern and still somehow clean. The cast, including an incredible rotation of special guests (for example, Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is electric. It has murder, romance, family and zombies, without ever coming out as a cartoon ... Somehow. You really connect with these characters. The whole production is an improbable magical act that left me, somewhat skeptical, if I said it myself, totally absorbed and coming back for more every Wednesday night. I just read this and it seems a bit like someone paid me to write it. It really is that good. I just heard a rumor that it was being canceled, so I thought I'd send a signal of goodwill. This is one of those shows that goes to the radar because the outfits of the network can not figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a great favor, if you have not already done so, and enjoy this gem for as long as it lasts. Okay, so one more thing. This show is smart. What that means is that every Hollywood writer / critic will insert a sticker before sitting down to watch it, defending himself with a "I could have written it" speech to anyone in their loneliness. renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words: the internet. This is a general / anonymous site of general interest. Before giving your Wednesday to the TV for the reruns of Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model, or anything else out of the crap these internet "critics" are not commenting on, take a look at my fave. It's fun. Good unpretentious fun.
