While rehearing Bizet's Carmen, middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to play the lead role. Antonio falls in love with Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman, unable to accept possessive love. When Carmen has a case with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original opera, interweaving fiction with reality. <br /> <br /> "Carmen" is another great film in the trilogy of Carlos Saura dedicated to flamenco dance. The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of artists intertwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and it is often not at all clear whether what is happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (from the play). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of Bizet's famous opera, based on the novel by Prosper Mérimée. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Carmen"
