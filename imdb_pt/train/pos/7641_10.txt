Everyone does their part very well in this "cool little movie". Belushi has the chance to live part of his life differently, but ends up realizing that what he had would be as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we should take advantage of the opportunities we have, not the ones we do not have or can not have. If you get that movie on video for about $ 10, it will be an investment!
