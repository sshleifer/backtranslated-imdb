Composed, elegant Carol (beautifully played by beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her friendly husband Eddie (nice David Houseman), Carol crazy, constantly eating best friend Anna (delightfully portrayed by the infectious buzz of the lovely Chris Jordan), and cute little Anna O loving husband Pete (typically Eric Edwards) is a quartet of freed swingers who enjoy having group sex often. His usual routine is interrupted when Carol's lonely, repressed but still seductive mother, Jennifer (a superbly touching performance of the lovely Jennifer Welles) appears for a visit. Soon, Jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the cheerful, carefree, uninhibited carnal lifestyle with everyone except Carol, eager to seduce her. Writer / director Joe Sarno invents a keen, captivating and insightful examination of suburban anguish and the limitations of the sexual revolution of all the wild'n'eas 70; Sarno transforms traditional middle-class mores into their heads and spices things even more with a bold and provocative mother / daughter incest subplot. In addition, Sarno uniformly provokes a cast's first-rate performance: Welles and Brooke are exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as the sexually out-of-date Shandara New Age therapist, and Erica Eaton as Mrs. . Fields. Better yet, all women are extremely hot and attractive; Welles, in particular, consumes the canvas with his exuberantly voluptuous figure and erotic presence in flames. The sex scenes are really chic and quite explicit, but never daring or tedious. Stephen Colwell's brilliant and polished cinematography and Jack Justis' melodic acoustic soundtrack are both solid and effective money. Recommended view for Sarno fans.
