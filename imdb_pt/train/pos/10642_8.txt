I just saw Detention last night and I liked what I saw. It was a cool and fun movie.Dolph looked supremely cool on the bike. He also looked good in this movie compared to his other recent films. He is now in a good shape. The story was okay and the other actors were also acceptable. I did not I would say this movie is his best, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But it also had its share of problems. The first was the way the bullets flew everywhere, and even when they were being fired at point-blank range, they missed the target. They should have shown that people escaped bullets in a better way. Another problem I had was the way the students were cursing. I do not know in which school the students can swear in front of the teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers. There should have been more bad guys. The last problem was definitely the fact that the whole looked tacky, but this was due to the small budget. Overall, the movie was a good movie. I liked it. I would recommend it to others to watch it. Q. Now you're a beat-up beat cop. (Some One liners were cool too) <br /> <br />
