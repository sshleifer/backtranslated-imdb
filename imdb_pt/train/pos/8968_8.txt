This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart movie, witty, charming and very enjoyable. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch who wishes to be human, is splendid, her subtle facial expressions, all her movements and gestures create something unique and a little different for Gillian. Spooky character, she left us hanging on every word of her. I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester highly commendable performances as the scotch lover writer obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and the last as the lovely aunt who can Stop to stop using magic, even when prohibited. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great, but again, when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any protagonist bad?
