I love this movie because I grew up around harness racing. Pat Boone, behind the bad mood, reminds me of my father, who was attracted to the trotters because, unlike the pure-bred jockeys, men of normal stature and weight can be conductors. <br /> <br /> Yes, the 1944 Indiana Home is a better movie, but it's also a very different movie. April Love is light and easy to watch, a good movie. (Disappointing that Pat Boone's religious / moral visions would prohibit him from kissing the girl!) Very different from today's normal fare.) House in Indiana with Walter Brennan (filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever blow up in music) captures stress and fights better, making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but requires greater emotional investment.
