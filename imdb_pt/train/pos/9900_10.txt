are movies like these that make you wish you'd never picked the nerd growing up in school. If you liked this movie then I suggest you watch Valentine. I just found out today that the guy who played Marty (Simon) killed himself a little after the movie's release, which is a pity, since he did a good job. I wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie. It starts when Carol tricks him into going to the ladies' room to act as if he's about to. When he was changing in the showers, popular friends of Carols entered the bathroom and prepared everything, camera, electric shock, pole. When Marty opened the curtain, naked, he realized that he was deceived. He tries to cover the shower, but the kids open it, grab Marty and start being bad for him while the camera is rolling. They picked him up, dipped his head in the toliet while he was being washed, and they carried him electrically (lightly). When the children are detained, given by the trainer, 2 of the boys give Marty a joint that will make him vomit. Skip breaks one of the glass windows of the gym using a brick to make the teacher apologize. While Marty vomits in the bathroom, Skip enters the Science Lab and mixes up some things that look like cocaine, but he is not sure what it was. The lab explodes badly by disfiguring it. Five years later, the children who tormented him that day received invitations to a 5-year reunion at the old school that was burned that day that exploded. One by one, people are dead. I do not understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could have come back after Marty left. She almost came out for the first time.
