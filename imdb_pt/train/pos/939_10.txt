Ok, there are a ton of reviews here, what can I add? <br /> <br /> I'll try anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYTHING. The scenery, outdoor locations, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The support cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew, played by Roger Rees. His discreet sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas to me. David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit. His life is difficult, but he remains positive and dignified. <br /> <br /> The best part of the course is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said that his portrait is very rude. I could not disagree more. Their early exchanges, though cold or harsh, were not outside the character. He is a terribly disillusioned man whose heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own greed for wealth. <br /> <br /> During flashbacks, it's obvious he's not all rude. It is here that we see that there is hope for him. If he was totally gone, his partner Marley would never have come to his benefit in the first place. And after all, we are none of us from the past waiting. I think it's a huge part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge observes his dance at his employer's house with Belle, you see him smile regretfully as he tells Belle in the flashback that he will go through life "with a smile on his face." Clive Donner was clever enough as a director to allow those moments in the movie. Sometimes they stay on the floor of the editing room. <br /> <br /> And finally, your conversion is so full of joy that makes me cry tears of joy EVERY time I see. His apology to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so touching, is the spirit not only of Christmas but of humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, to his wife, is so apparent. And the line that catches me every time, "God forgive me for the time I lost." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
