Robert Culp (they call his character "doctor" ... I think he's a veterinarian or something) and the family moves into a prosperous suburb with little tax and no law. The culprit and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbors become drunk and "travel" through their garden at 60 km / h. He presses the accusations, which arouses the children's anger, and suddenly he and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing campaign. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Manson, er, Marlyn Mason, touches his angry, boiled. High income wife, who encourages her not to use violence against her irreverent enemies, and who really only wants to move somewhere with decent public services. But The System is not taking Culp anywhere, and he's not about to leave the house because of some punk boys and his crazy rock and roll music. And we all know what people do when the system crashes ... (but that's based on a real story, which makes it even better). <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while the hooligan villains do have funk-o-matic "teenage" theme song from the 70's that warns us when they are not doing anything right, this movie actually ends up dealing with age groups impartially (really!). It does not do a great generational thing with that. Congratulations on that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like dogs (or at least believe in protecting your civil rights, like me), and like justice, and like fire, and like justice for dogs fire, and you think people who go out of trouble communities are "very ugly", so the spirit of this movie is in its alley. No, it's not really "good", at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word. There is nothing subtle, unobtrusive or clever about it, it's just a sort of long-running PSA for vigilantism. However, it captures the feeling of some memorable scenes in other beloved works. Remember in The Dark Knight Returns, by Frank Miller, when Batman leads the Mutants on horseback to recover Gotham City? Remember that scene in A Christmas Story, where the boy hits the face of the bully? Remember how cool this was? Or do you really hate being seen as funny by your neighbors? Yes, Mon. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was a 1973 TV movie that I just picked up at 4 AM at my local WB affiliate, and it's probably not meant for the release of the DVD. But after being inspired by this movie, you think I'll sit here and catch!
