"If I sit down, I'll never stand," is what the title's mother tells her son when he tells her to rest for a while (she's a widow). He means that rest is what a woman of her age and in her situation has to do: rest in peace, neglect herself. But she does not want to "rest," not yet. She also has a daughter who blames her for every disaster in her life ... Suddenly the revelation comes: sex and passion in the figure of a muscular carpenter 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the brand-new James Bond) when she "I thought no one would ever touch her again." It's a story that makes you think about many things, especially about what a 60-year-old woman should do with her life when her husband dies. It does not seem that we advance such in these respects. I mean, no one is surprised when Sean Connery has a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it were otherwise? An old woman, a young face ... no, you're not ready for it, are you? <br /> <br /> The film has intimate tones throughout its length except for 2 or 3 sequences in which shades breaks and comes out some explicit and foul-mouthed dialogues. These vulgar touches and the way the son and daughter discover their mother's love affair (very absurd - you'll know what I mean when I watch) - are the only dissenting elements in "The Mother." <br /> <br /> * My fee: 7/10
