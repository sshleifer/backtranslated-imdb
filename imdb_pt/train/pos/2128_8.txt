I watched this in Turner Classic Movies last night for the first time, and I loved it. I like many of the older movies, especially because of the absence of all filthy language and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most movies today. I also think they were made much better in many cases (but not at all). Jimmy Stewart is one of my favorites. I just thought this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and I really enjoyed it. If you feel the same about older movies, I do not think you can go wrong with this movie. I believe "You've Got Mail" is a remake (albeit a bit different and also a very nice film) from this movie. For a relaxing night out with a movie, you do not need to be ashamed if your kids or anyone get into your viewing, grab this or watch on one of the classic movie channels.
