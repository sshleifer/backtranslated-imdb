I've been looking for the name of this movie for years. I was 14 when I believe it aired on TV in 1983. All I remember was that it was about a teenager alone, having survived a plane crash and survived the Amazon. I remember people were looking for her (family) and she knew how to take care of herself - she tells the story and I vividly remember about her knowing that the bugs were under her skin. I do not remember anything else about this movie, and I want to see it again - if this is the same - and if any of you have a copy, could you send me an email to horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'd be curious to get a copy to see if it's actually the same movie I remember. It aired on Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983, and I was going through my own problems and this movie really impacted heavily on me. Thanks in advance!
