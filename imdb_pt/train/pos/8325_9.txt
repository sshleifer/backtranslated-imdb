I loved the idea of ​​this movie from the moment I first saw a trailer for it. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the gentle, playful and slightly mad genius was enough to make me see the movie. Matthau's additional seasoning as Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> History is pure fantasy, but it's a delight. A car mechanic falls in love with a pretty woman, who happens to be Einstein's niece. With the help of four fairy godfathers from physics, Ed embarks on a mission to conquer Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fiance (which exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology) and Eisenhower in the mix, and you have complete fun. <br /> <br /> The film is full of great characters actors and deliciously sweet and extravagant performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a mischievous pillow; Cupid with a ruler. Tim Robbins is wonderfully captivating when Ed and Meg Ryan step up from their normal level of rom-com. Stephen Fry is a joy as "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiance; who does not have a single romantic bone in his body. <br /> <br /> The film was below most radars, but it is a delightful treasure that does not become obsolete with repeated views. It has writing and first-class performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world.
