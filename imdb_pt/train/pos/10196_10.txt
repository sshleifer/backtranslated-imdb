Many compliments to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - there's the drama, the action, the romance and the scene that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Although the story is not so original (a love triangle - or make a love of four corners, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as Lord), its presentation is something cool, especially in original language - bisaya for Filipino, nipongo for Japanese and English for American. <br /> <br /> This movie will be one of the best Pinoy films this year. <br /> <br /> Go watch this!
