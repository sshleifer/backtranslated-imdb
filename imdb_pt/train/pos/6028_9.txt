This is the film in Antonioni's mid-term that most critics belittle as a "faulty" look at American youth culture / politics of the 1960s. For what it's worth, I found it more moving and memorable than his more acclaimed as L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because it shows more emotion and empathy here than anywhere else. The story is simple, but it is used as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observations and criticisms of the American consumer culture, student life, counterculture, and the anti-establishment and anti-war reaction that was so prominent at the time. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, it is a remarkably worked film; from the opening credits sequel to the bizarre 'love-in' desert, to the use of billboards, and to that cathartic jaw-dropping end that used 17 camera set-ups (in its own way, as powerful as the climax) of wild group). In addition, Antonioni chose a great protagonist with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful that has already graced the screen. There is not much 'acting' involved, as this seems more like a docu-drama, and so the use of non-professionals as the main couple works quite effectively within that context. And the soundtrack is not just full of wonderful music, its use is impressive too (I can not forget the beginning of the film, mainly due to the selection of songs - by Pink Floyd - that prepares the visuals as well). Contrary to popular opinion, this is a great achievement in film, and I would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off-beat. Worth looking for, and one of those 60s key movies that requires a DVD restoration / release.
