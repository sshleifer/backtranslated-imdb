I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies, but I heard that was fine. I was shocked. Easily the most romantic thing I have ever seen in my life. Impressive. Bright, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is perfect, as is writing and direction. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet that you think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> Movies grab you right away and do not let go. You can not look away, nor can you stop hearing them. Even the little moments just melt your heart. <br /> <br /> It jumped into the ranks of one of my usual favorites. A masterpiece.
