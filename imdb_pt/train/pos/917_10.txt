I watched this in July and even with the Christmas theme, I found it touching and sensitive. It is not for someone with a reality-mind as it is full of fantasy and lovely moments that sometimes make no sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I only saw him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a weak character. But in this, the expression in his eyes throughout, as Hank considered the things that were happening to him, was wonderful and tender. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and adorable as usual and very believable in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was splendid and always brought a smile when he appeared in several important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one in which Hank realizes who Max really was in his life. Not for everyone ... especially those who do not like 'feel-good' movies and this is definitely one! If you like everything to be perfect and make sense, avoid this one. But I think it's worth revisiting, and that's why I recorded it. (Yes, some of us still have VCRs :)
