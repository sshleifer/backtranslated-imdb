Anyone who has never seen anything like the fight scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The fight scenes were choreographed by the psychopath from the Yuen Woo Ping action scene, who also did the Matrix fights. And the fight scenes are something. <br /> <br /> Li plays a supersoldate who does not feel pain, who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian (you got me). When other evil super-soldiers begin to kill local drug lords to take on the drug trade, Li joins his police friend to help stop them. <br /> <br /> There are some absolutely crazy things going on in this badguy movie grabs his arm with a glass panel and barely notices). The fight scenes are full of kicks and punches; the body count is up there. Li rarely was better, and he surrounded himself with a bunch of pretty women (Yip kicks a serious ass like a supersold colleague). Anthony Wong even makes a special guest appearance as a drug dealer (there are no surprises there, he makes a special guest appearance in every HK movie). It's unfortunate that they do not make action movies like this in the US; I would not have to go through all these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action I so yearn for. Recommended.
