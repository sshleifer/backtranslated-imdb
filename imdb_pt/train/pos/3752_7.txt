This movie is unusual and bizarre, and is almost unusual and bizarre in a very good way. I give this shorts a 7 only because it's so unique and off-the-wall, but most of the time it feels like it's being bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre. If the film had managed to integrate its most bizarre moments into some plotting, then it would have been really fantastic. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that it seems that the creators simply put together a lot of things. of crap on spatulas, then threw in a lot more crap that sounded as if it would sound funny coming from the mouth of a spatula. <br /> <br /> This is definitely worth checking out, but it's not top rate by any stretch of wild imaginations creators.
