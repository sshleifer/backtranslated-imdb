The only notable thing about this movie is that it was the first major role of Steve McQueen. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped and crude, but pleasantly honest in this little piece of science fiction horror. Steve shows up as the antiestablishment, a hitchhiker who would become a polished icon of the film industry five years from now. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen would say that he hated this movie and that "he was the blob." But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is cute, fresh and innocent. Did we all stay that way? <br /> <br /> The plot is fast and, although predictable, it's still a fun time. And it's a lot of fun to see Steve McQueen before he became The Kool King (and Anita Corsaut before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD a while back and is a valuable addition to my collection of Steve McQueen movies.
