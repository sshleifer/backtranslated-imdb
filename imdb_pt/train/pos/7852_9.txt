Ladislas Starewicz's curiosity with insects and cinema turns into a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper, and Mrs. Beetle. The rather simple story of a couple of adulterous beetles who seek encouragement out of their marriage is similar to a Biograph or Vitagraph that is smaller than the time. Starewicz's twist in history is to use embalmed beetles wired straightening the legs in frame-by-frame animation. The story is built when Mr. Beetle is captured on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper. When Mr. Beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of his artistic friend, he chases her around in anger, but eventually forgives her and takes her outside to watch a movie. However, Mrs. Beetle soon discovers her husband's infidelities as the movie they watch is the footage of Mr. Beetle's skeptical beetle and dragonfly together. Mrs. Beetle hits Mr. Beetle with her umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps across the screen, and both end up in jail after the projector they destroy catch fire. Insects are placed in humanized environments, such as a house or a nightclub, and receive human characteristics of jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. Insect characters carry suitcases, drive cars and even wear shoes, but they also rummage through their antennae and open and close their jaws like real insects. The novelty of the story does not wear out, even after several displays, but no matter how fluid the movements, the film moves slowly. The action happens in intricate detail, but the speed and fastest rate of filming is lost in the process. Despite its pace, the film is a prime example of Starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended.
