A fabulous movie. With everything you could want in a movie. Huge battle scenes and lots of other action. Suspense and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> More or less like an old buck movie. Totally fun from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The editing was fast and you never get bored for a second. The story is like a classic story of problems in the Royal House. The actors are gorgeous and the sets gorgeous. The costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative. The special effects are amazing too. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is really amazing as an actor and gorgeous to behold. He looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as he usually is. He is one of the great actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the protagonist, even making an English accent with remarkable success. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the movie has won countless awards, and I can see why. <br /> <br /> In short, this is an incredible independent film. See for sure. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend. And give a TEN + !!!
