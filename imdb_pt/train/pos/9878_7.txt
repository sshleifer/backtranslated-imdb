Almost every review in this movie I saw was very bad. It's not too bad, it's actually very good, although not great. Judy Garland's character might have been annoying, but she did not allow it. Somewhere along the line, I became a thoughtful, authoritative fan, overreaching Van Heflin, at least in the early '40s. Judy's singing is great, but the movie missed a big chance for no longer showing the relationship their. I gave a 7.
