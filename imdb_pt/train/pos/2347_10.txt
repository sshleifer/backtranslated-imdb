I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the beginning. It's wonderfully invented, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable how much TV has needed an original creative program like Pushing Daisies. It's a huge relief to see a show, which is different from the rest, where, if you compared it to some of the more recent shows like Scrubs and House, you'd see the similarities, and this can be tedious in a few moments. See shows of identity so close. <br /> <br /> With a magnificent cast, wonderful script and hilarity in every episode, Pushing Daisies is by far one of the most notable programs on your television.
