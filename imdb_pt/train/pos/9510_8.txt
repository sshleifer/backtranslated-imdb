In the winter of 1931, 12-year-old Tyler Hoechlin (as Michael Sullivan Jr.) imagines what his mafia dad Tom Hanks (Michael "Mike" Sullivan) does for a living. Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to "work" one night and witnesses him by detonating some rival bandits. This leads - in a very indirect way - "Godfather" type Paul Newman (as John Rooney) to hire Jude Law (as Harlen Maguire) to track down Hoechlin and Hanks, who are about to cool their heels in Chicago. . Hanks thinks they'll be safe with a relative, which is intriguing when you consider the line of work of the characters. Strangely appearing with Paul Peterson ("The Donna Reed Show"), Hoechlin does a great job. for director Sam Mendes; and starting to work with this cast makes him the most lauded young actor of 2002. But the most striking thing about "Road to Perdition" is the stunning cinematography of Conrad L. Hall, who deservedly earned an Academy Award " by the late photographer. Mr. Hall's work is truly superlative. This helps to compensate for the overall impression of a measured and planned staginess for the narrative and the visual. The divergent end is abruptly uplifting (the unrelated dog is an example of the above-mentioned staging). Road to Perdition (7/12/02) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks, Tyler Hoechlin, Paul Newman, Jude Law
