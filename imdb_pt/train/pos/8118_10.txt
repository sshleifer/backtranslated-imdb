I first saw it in 1975 on some German TV channel and was hooked immediately, then watched this movie about 12 times in theaters and nowadays I have a videotape that I watch at least once a year - this movie is great in all aspects (direction, acting, cut, musical score ...). The scenarios are staggering and impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating world war beginning in the late 1930s looks like a prophecy for a 1936 film, the dictator of "Everytown" is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is simply charming, believable and ideally cast as " the hero". The positive tone regarding technology and progress is quite refreshing by the normally pessimistic standards of today - especially the final scene that always brings a tear or two to my eyes, even after watching the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is good on TV, but it was made for the big screen, so if you have the opportunity to see it in some movie theater. Please, it's impressive.
