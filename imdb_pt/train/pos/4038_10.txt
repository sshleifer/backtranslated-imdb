This may be the only film that really comes close to capturing on film the essentially unrecognizable world of the American university experience of the late 60's and early 70's. Go ahead, name another film that approaches that: "Getting Straight "? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "Return of the Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but it is a retrospective film about (self-obsessed) individuals rather than a film about a time and place portrayed * in * that time and place. "Drive, He Said" portrays - with subtlety and nuance where it should, and a quick kick in the shorts, where this is the only appropriate way - the anti-draft movement, the ambiguity of major college sports (especially when there is a war against) , the sexual revolution of the period and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was like this. <br /> <br /> The whole cast deserves praise (as well as the director, of course), but the special praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, as the basketball coach, and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual - except for this time - love interest. William Tepper, as the protagonist, also acclaimed a real salvo of palms, both for his perfect capture of the athlete-student of the period, and for having played real college basketball in the movie (recalls Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"? all a classic of a kind - and the last film that anyone currently in 6th grade should write about comments ("boring", "repellent" - um, son of a bitch, please go back to your Arnold movies). Why is not this movie available in imdb?
