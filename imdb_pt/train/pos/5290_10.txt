Going for something away from the deliberately disgusting thing he usually does, John Waters (Congratulations, John!) Made this parody of the world of celebrities / art. Edward Furlong plays the title character, a working-class teenager in Baltimore who loves to photograph things. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovers her work, she offers him his great opportunity, which he accepts. But once he gets it right, he has to reconsider everything. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Pecker" looks like he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity. The kind of thing we can expect, of course, but with Waters driving, there are always some things that shock us (you'll meet them when you see them). I would certainly recommend it. Also starring Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
