I think part of the reason this movie was made ... and it's aimed at us, players who actually play all of Nancy Drew's PC games. Lately there have been many video game-based movies, and I find that in one of them. <br /> <br /> So this movie does not follow any book. But it follows parts of the games. I buy and play all Nancy Drew games as soon as they leave. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of a mouse!" And some of those games actually won the Parents' Choice Gold Award. They are not only fun, but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing. <br /> <br /> I took two of my kids to go see them and they loved it! The 10 year old had started playing her first game of Nancy Drew one day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having a blast playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was right ... she not only loved this movie but could not wait to get home to finish her first game and start another. <br /> <br /> My other step daughter is only 7 years old and she also loved the movie but she is still a bit for young people also play the games yet but she likes to watch her sister play sometimes only to see what is happening. <br /> <br /> Games are based for children 10 years and over. All games generally get great rave reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information about the games, check out the HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally, I found the movie very good and I'll buy it when it's released on DVD.
