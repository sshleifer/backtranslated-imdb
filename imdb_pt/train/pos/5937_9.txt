After seeing the short "Batman Dead End", I did not know what to expect from World's Finest. Of course, Superman and Batman. All the comics in my World's Finest have them as a team. After seeing this 3 1/2-minute trailer, I wanted someone to make a fan film for World's Finest. Of course, some of Superman's stuff was extravagant, but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers, giving you only certain aspects of the entire product. This looks like it needs a complete product. <br /> <br /> In addition to director Sandy Collera's relative playing a painfully poor Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie were made, the actors would be chosen to fit into the movie account, although I believe Nina Kaczorowski would be a good Lois Lane, especially if she was given a dialogue closer to the character. <br /> It's nice to see Clark Bartram wearing Batman's fantasy of Dead End, but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the Batman of the 40's with the cover and the 80-90 leather cloak . His behavior is similar to Batman, but I still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses, instead of just allowing his eyes to appear through the mask. I believe that the goal was to bring him closer to both the comic character and the personality of the film. <br /> Michael O'Hearn can not play Superman, period. He gets a silly look on his face that simply says "hit me." And line delivery seems to be a problem for him. <br /> <br /> Overall though, I would love to see a full story and a movie based on this ingenious work. There was a rumor about a World's Finest movie being made, and with the correct additions to the script, that could be it. I hope more how this is done.
