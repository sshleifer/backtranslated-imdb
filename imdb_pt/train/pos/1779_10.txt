I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands down! It's so good! I'm not much of a movie fan, but I have to tell you that this opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast energy. I was lucky enough to catch this on a display during the Zoinks! Boston Film Festival, and the story really got me involved from the beginning. I had many adult themes and characters and when it was over I wanted more. I hope they make a continuation. That would be fun. My only problem with that is Melissa Connor's performance as Anya. UGH! She sucks! I have seen a block of wood perform better. I do not know what the director was thinking when he chose her. But if you ignore it, you can not help giving this movie a big ten!
