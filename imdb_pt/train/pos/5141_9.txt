I have to admit, I was not expecting much to watch this movie in my Japenese film class, but this movie really surprised me. The director does a wonderful job tracking the title of his film, really portraying an image of madness. I think the fact that this movie is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer to experience the inner world of characters and not the world out of his mind. This movie has just added to my feelings regarding the dumb foreign versus American films in which foreign films work a lot more to exercise their mind and make you think instead of going to the fluffy movie always with the happy ending by exercising the imagination very little.
