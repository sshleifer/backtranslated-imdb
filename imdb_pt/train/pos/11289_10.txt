There is something wonderful about the fact that a film made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above all of the Tarzan films that followed, including the swollen, boring 1980s piece Greystoke. Once the viewer passes through the first three scenes, which are admittedly dull, Tarzan and his Companion take off like a shot, offering uninterrupted action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and comes out with the movie. Weismuller is solid too. Highly recommended.
