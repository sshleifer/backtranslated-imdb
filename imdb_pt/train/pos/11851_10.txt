At a time when Hollywood makes money showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs and war, this movie reminds us of the concept of the "Indomitable Spirit." If you are feeling dejected, this movie will free your mind and put it on high. We all know how difficult life can be, sometimes we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will help us. That's what this movie did for me and I hope it's for you.
