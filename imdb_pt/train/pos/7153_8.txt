My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story, having read to several of her classes. That never seemed so interesting to me, though, and I bought the DVD figuring it would be a movie that would not really be my alley. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot of set-up and I found myself thinking that I was right. It starts a bit slow and I have to admit I was a bit bored - but curious enough to stick with it. Boy, I'm glad I did because it turned out to be a very satisfying and rewarding film. I would certainly watch it again! <br /> <br /> The cast was very good. As I have not read the book, I can not guarantee the accuracy, but I must say that Jon Voight was really delicious. You liked the characters you should like, hated the ones you should hate, and laughed at those who were supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I can see how some people may not like this movie. . It is tedious at times, especially in the beginning. All flashbacks can be distracting (though they are essential to the story). Once the story begins to come together in the end, I think you get paid back for your patience. When all is said and done, I think this is a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
