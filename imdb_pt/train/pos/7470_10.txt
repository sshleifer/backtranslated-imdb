I went to see Vanilla Sky with a huge, huge, huge !! .. Tom Cruise fan, my extremely cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say .. I was totally impressed with the film and especially the performance of TC, I thought it was a very moving film and it was nothing I expected. <br /> <br /> I had read the reviews and had decided not to go see him, I am so pleased that I was 'coerced' to see him. The strange thing is that I can not say why, all I can say is that I found it totally engaging and I could not stop thinking about it the next day. As for what I felt about the movie, all I can say is that it is NOT HISTORY (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) about the people and events that shape your life and how small events such as getting into a car, can change everything ...... As for what the critics wrote, yes, perhaps the original was a dazzling second film for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but this was a totally different interpretation of the subject, and any way a narcissistic remake for the benefit of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not even think of writing some trivial sentences to describe the movie and see it !!!! <br /> Yes, I know this is not a thoughtful and balanced review, but so what? It's not that kind of movie.
