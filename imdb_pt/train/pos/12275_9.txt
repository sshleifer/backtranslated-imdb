I have never heard of the book, nor do I care to read it, but the film I will probably see many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is unforgettable, perhaps with the richest images I have ever seen in a movie. It was as if I was looking at paintings many times, which I think was the idea. <br /> <br /> Great movie, history, actors and cinematography. Full of deep emotions from every angle. Although I do not much like romance movies, I loved it and was deeply moved by Winona Ryder's request to her father at the end. <br /> <br /> Irons deserved a prize for his performance and Close has never been better. <br /> <br />
