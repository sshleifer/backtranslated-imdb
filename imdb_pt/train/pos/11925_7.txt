I happened to get this movie on cable one afternoon. I have to admit I've never been a big baseball fan, but sometimes I can get into a good sports-related movie. What I found most interesting was the representation of the system of adoptive families. As a therapist who saw both the good and the bad of community mental health and the adoption system, I found it refreshing to see a movie that showed the ups and downs of that system: people jumping from family to family, biological. parents do not always take active involvement, and transitions can be heart-wrenching and heart-melting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film, and both bring very convincing performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I found myself shedding a tear at the end of the movie.
