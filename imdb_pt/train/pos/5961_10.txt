I can be biased; I am the author of the novel The Hungry Bachelors Club, self-published in 1994. The screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor Fred Dresch who was the inspiration for the Marlon character in the film. I could not be more satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the movie in full and I will comment more. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stellar. It carries most emotional vehicles in good shape. I could not have done better myself! This looks like real people, hardly driven by formulas, and fortunately prompts my statement against racial prejudice at home, graciously and honestly.
