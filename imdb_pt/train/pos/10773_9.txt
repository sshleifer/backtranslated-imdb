I recommend this movie to everyone. Not only for fans of rocker Luciano Ligabue, but for all movie fans. Because it's sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and movie lover, and every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because your characters are loved and asked to be loved. Because most of the Italian debut films are bad and this, made by a stranger, is a real joy to watch and to listen. Because Stefano Accorsi is beautiful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who was, as Freccia, beautiful, talented and good and lost her life because of the heroine, which Ligabue shows as it is, without glamor and ugly, without giving in to easy moralisms . Because it's a movie that speaks to our heart, our ears, our souls. And because I lived the FM radio experience and it was just like that. Thank you, Luciano!
