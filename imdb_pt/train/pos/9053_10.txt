1.) This movie was awesome! I watched while I was in the city next to the one where he grew up! I went and saw the buildings where the story happened. Overall, I loved this movie, one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best! Besides, my favorite parts were the science fair and every time with his father. They were so sad, it seemed. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father did not seem to care one way or another. This tag line is true. "Sometimes a dream is bright enough to light up the sky." 2) The way this movie was filmed was flawless, it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950s. The dress was accurate and they also had their slang. Definitely recommend this movie!
