I got caught reading the previous reviews that this movie went straight to the cable. Well, I paid to see in a theater, and I'm glad I did because visually it was a remarkable movie. Most of the settings look like they were made in the early 60's (except for the psychiatrist's office, which was dated in a different way), and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequences off, the whole movie has a faded 60's vibe . And the use of restaurants in the movie was fascinating. For a first-time director whose record, I believe, is written, he has a great eye. For the first ten minutes, I felt that the plot had no plausibility, so I simply sighed in disbelief and set out for the walk. In terms of acting and representing parent-child relationships, mother-child, husband-wife, father-son, the film was perfect. William H. Macy, a pleasure to watch, seems to be filling the void left by the late Tony Perkins, if that and Magnolia are any indication. Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was quite exciting for me. It was a three-dimensional representation of a character often seen by society as two-dimensional. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portraits. The representation of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me, in an indirect way, of Vincent Gallo's BUFFALO '66, although a little weakened! I would definitely pay to see a second film from that director. He has the self-discipline of a 1950s porn director (something Mr. Anderson never will!), But he has a visual style and a way with the actors who command attention.
