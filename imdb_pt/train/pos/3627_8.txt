What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a sentimental children's movie and found that I liked it more than my teenage years. Take a tissue, not sad, it just "moves" in parts. Finally, it's a 'feel-good' movie for the whole family. Note: it is more than 2 hours, so consider leaving the house of the little ones who are in contact with this. AP
