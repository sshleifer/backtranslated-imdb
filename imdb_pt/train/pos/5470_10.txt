BABY FACE is one of the best "forgotten" movies before the code. It was shown last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE at TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I was able to watch the movie as it is now with another four minutes restored. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is living in East St. Louis (where she may have met drunken parents of "Myra" - Mae Clarke - in WATERLOO BRIDGE). Her father is Robert Barrett. She has lived with him since the death of her mother and (in the restored dialogue) he has tormented her since she was 14 years old. Now she is a resident waitress and a part-time prostitute in her speakeasy, her closest friend Chico (Theresa Harris), the African-American servant Barrett keeps intimidating. It is one of the two positive points of Stanwyck's personality that she stands with her father over Harris, threatening to leave if Harris gets fired (and how stupid workers are like Nat Pendleton, who likes to see Stanwyck serve them instead of the taste of the drink he brings, Barrett has to obey her. <br /> <br /> The only guy who comes to the regular speakeasy of whom Stanwyck likes is the cobbler and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier)., who sees a great potential in the witty girl if she simply leaves her home abandoned.He is also pushing Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy and the idea of ​​the will to power.More about it later. <br /> <br /> After she drops the a local police officer (Arthur Hohl), and has an argument with Barrett about it, an explosion still kills Barrett, and allows Stanwyck to leave his hometown.He and Harris head to New York, getting free transportation in a freight wagon , sleeping with a parasol reio (James Murray). They arrive in New York, and after walking, they see the Gotham Trust Company (founded in 1873), and the friendly guard tells her where the staffing office is. <br /> <br /> Slowly, we see Stanwyck climbing the corporate ladder to the top, similar (but more stinky) than Robert Morse dared at SUCCESS IN BUSINESS WITH NO REALLY TRYING. But Morse was a man in a company dominated by men. Stanwyck knows that his sexual fascination is his weapon. It passes by John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (a section of the film that I always found most shocking - oddly enough - when I watched), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker and finally George Brent. Everyone ends up falling in love with her and being left out when she is no longer useful or destroyed by her. Brent, the new president of the bank founded by his grandfather, ends up marrying her - and the crisis of the film is when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after Brent buys a fortune in jewelry and gives him valuable titles). Brent is indicted. Is she going to stand by him? <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING: <br /> <br /> The only thing about these films that is not admitted is that the theatrical and moral conventions of the time still dictated endings. The original ending had Stanwyck embarking on a ship to Europe, abandoning Brent to his fate, but realizing that she could not do it with him, returning to his apartment, and discovering that he had shot himself. She's walking with him to the hospital when it's over. Now, before the rediscovered footage is found, the movie ended with them apparently giving all their money to the bank to save him, and retreating back to East St. Louis to live happily if he is poor. <br /> <br /> These are good endings. Stanwyck was to continue his destructive course, with Brent the last of his victims. But even without Breen's office, the writers (by the way, it's Darryl Zanuck) thought it was good that she found a moral center. She does not have any - at least none for powerful men (whom she hates). I do not think a hearing of depression would have tolerated this kind of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society. It was the world of a man in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck has his work cut out for her. Wood (when she'll be fired for an indiscretion with him) admits he did not want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006 Stanwyck would have found a woman everywhere. In the film there are unpleasant and malicious remarks (obviously some based on envy) to Stanwyck from other secretaries and employees of his rapid growth. In 2006, she would often be confronting the senior women, and she would find them cutting them in the legs very quickly. Of course, if she thinks one or two are lesbians, she might try that one, but it's dubious. And she also never seems to meet men who are gay. They have gay male business executives who did not give a shit about their legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there's her mentor, Mr. Cragg. Cragg is remade in the "peeled" version to try to get her to seek a moral center. In fact, he pushes Nieztsche, but the path (in a broader sense) of the Nazis pushed Nieztsche - find his way to power and push him. While Nieztsche emphasized power at times, it was not the best and the end of all his theories. Otherwise, nobody would read it today in university courses. Cragg is obviously self-taught, but only half-educated. In short, if someone who studied Nieztsche minutely confronted Cragg, he would appear to be an uneducated idiot. And this is Stanwyck's mentor! A good movie, and for the day is worth 10 ... but seriously flawed.
