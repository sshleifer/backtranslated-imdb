I accidentally went in, was behind the movie box of what I thought I was renting, I did not find out until I got home, I watched anyway. Absolutely fantastic! a wonderful movie, and one of my three all-time favorites, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is pleasant and easy to follow, this could have been easily confused, but the actors and the director does a great job at keeping him together. <br /> <br /> The actors themselves are fantastic, exhibiting a wonderful character and doing a great job. <br /> <br /> We have to find a copy somewhere ...........
