There were times when this movie seemed to get a lot more complicated than I needed, but I think that's part of its charm. Detective Philo Vance's powers of observation seem larger than all the eastern detectives of the time combined when it comes to the final assessment of how the murders were committed. The falling of the dagger into the Chinese vase was the kicker for me; I mean, could not somebody just quit? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had a line at the beginning of the film about Archer Coe's "psychological impossibility" of killing himself - I had to think about it for a while. I was wondering if there is any scientific basis for this concept to be true, not having studied psychology alone. It seems logical, but there is always the case that does not fit the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I got a kick from the hectic coroner (Etienne Girardot), who reminded me of Dr. Star Trek. McCoy the couple of times, he stated, "I am a doctor, not a magician" and "I am a doctor, not a detective". I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and saying to himself - 'I'm going to have to use it someday.' <br /> <br /> Once the killer's identity is revealed, it does not seem like a big surprise, but until then it's really nobody knows. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the film did not answer the central question posed by the title, and the murder I was really interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's dog, Ghillie?
