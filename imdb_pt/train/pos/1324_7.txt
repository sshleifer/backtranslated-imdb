You sit there for half an hour and watch a story, believe everything, then watch another half hour of the same story unfolding ... and then reassemble. Bright. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting films of the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know if - in addition to Andrew Jarecki's "Capturing the Friedmans" - there was once something like "Forbidden Lie $" by Anna Broinowski. He presents, exposes, defends, reveals, and questions everything about Norma Khouri, author of "Honor Lost," the acclaimed and criticized 2001 bestseller on honor crimes in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is incredible and what makes the film is so exceptional that this "exhibition" of Khouri is made with the full participation of Khouri. For the opening part of the film, Khouri presents his story about the alleged killing by honor of a friend of hers in Amman, the story of the book. She sounds completely convincing, convincing. <br /> <br /> So your story is broken up, exposed by eminently credible and convincing people, like women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative reporters from there and Australia, where Khouri lived. A time. <br /> <br /> Khouri comes back and denies the charges by doing a successful lie detector test in the process. Another segment of devastating exposures arrives - which should not be specified here as this would reduce the value of the shock ... and then Khouri comes back and faces the charges (not all but the essentials in the book issue). <br /> <br /> And Houdini's act continues, with round after round in this heavyweight, seesaw prize fight, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the direction of resolution. Bright.
