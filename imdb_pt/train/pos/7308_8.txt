Michael Myers has escaped from a nearby insane asylum ... after shooting down his sister fifteen years earlier, he is now back in Haddonfield, the sleepy city of Illinois where his murder took place. Once he fixes his eyes on Laurie after she leaves a package to the abandoned house where he lived, he begins to chase her and terrify her, turning her night of fun into terror as he catches anyone on his way to reach her. Beautiful cinematography and lighting really make this horror movie scary ... with the long, dark planes, it looks like you're being chased by the serial killer maniac. Myers is well hidden until it is completely revealed in the exciting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Although "Halloween" is certainly outdated, it is by no means less creepy.
