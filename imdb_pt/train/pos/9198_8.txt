B movie? Yes. DO YOURSELF? Yes. First movie? Yes. But aesthetically A +. This movie definitely had some bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. etc. problems. However, this movie has many positive things about it. First, the most annoying character dies first! Secondly, it's made to be a parody / horror movie B Rated Horror. The comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling on the floor laughing. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people try to get all the independent films and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take for what it is, a lot of kids right after high school made their first movie. For what it is, only that, is really good.
