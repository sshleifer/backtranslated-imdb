Russell, my fav, is beautiful in this movie. But more than that, the film covers a tremendous variety of human passion and sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is approached and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that the tolerance of other human beings provides the way to save mankind. Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat your scenes over and over again. Anyone who has ever loved will have empathy for these people. All characters are cast and portrayed in an excellent way.
