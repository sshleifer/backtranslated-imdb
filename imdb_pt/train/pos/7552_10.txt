CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary Nekojiru manga. He won the "Best Short Film" award at the 6th Fantasy Film Festival and also won the "Excellence Award" at the Japan Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When the soul of the Nyaako kitten is stolen by the Death, she and her brother Nyatta embarks on a bizarre journey to retrieve it. In the surreal dream of the Other Side, they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable adventures, often disturbing. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an anime you've never seen. It's Hello Kitty in Acid! It is very original, incredibly beautiful and has a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surrealistic (there is no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and bloody. So it's more of an anime for adults than kids (they can not understand anything!). A great journey for anyone who has a chance to see this absolute masterpiece. Unmissable!
