A French film Ester Williams would love. But the synchronized swim was just a hook for the story of three girls in a Paris exuberance meeting. There is no doubt that the sympathies of Sciamma are present, since all the boys are represented as "animaux", but in fact only the 3 girls are in focus, and throughout the time, with the few adults and the other adolescents in second plan. Marie is a stick girl, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and imposes herself on Floriane (a quality Renaissance beauty by a critic) and is also a friend of convenience to Anna: not attractive at all, but for her, her body's perfection time was short, and now she is a teenager in a woman's body. What follows is a journey to self-realization without a script, but there is a discouragement about the three that is unnatural: where is the joy and meaningless chatter of youth? While the outcome was breathtaking, with Floriane's beautifully portrayed self-absorption, as well as the equally beautiful marriage of Marie and Anne, everything seemed abstract, the Sciamma dolls.
