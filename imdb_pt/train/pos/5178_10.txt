Before the Tuscan Sky, I saw the tender performance of Diane Lane in this otherwise skylark of a movie. Campers are invited to camp their youth and try it as adults. Each of those who return seem to be looking for something they have lost, which makes it so realistic. Maybe you had to be a camper to really understand, but in the words of a character realizing that all her clothes were wet "this is so camp!" From the boyfriend's pranks and fights, from the scary lunch box and the morning bell ... it's the amplifier. Since exciting activities now seem mundane. A formidable cast makes the best of one-dimensional roles and makes them believable. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he fell in love with her !!) The beautiful scenery, bright colors, comic music (including variations of Hello Muddah) and a comedic performance by Sam Raimi do that. a movie you can take again and again how to look for an old friend.
