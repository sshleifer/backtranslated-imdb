Deathtrap runs as a play within a movie about who did what for whom, since it occurs mostly in a set. The premise is that a gifted playwright whose star is falling receives a magnificent manuscript from an ex-student and then plans to turn off his protege and appropriate his game to his wife's (loud) protests. Or so you think, for the first half of the movie. After half way, Deathtrap begins to play twists and surprises that turn your premise into your head, then around, and then into a crazy spin, all the while keeping your title appropriate. It's an excellent mystery movie steeped in intelligence. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a senior playwright, plays himself in this film - a somewhat wacky and dramatic Briton. No surprise here - it does its usual good job. He gets the best Deathtrap line, which performs perfectly: "What is your definition of success being struck in a state penitentiary?" <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve, on the other hand, manipulates comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance playing the ambitious (and psychopathic) young playwright. He also shows off his very toned body, which he must have kept coming off of Superman's movies. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve collaborated on another film that is one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. In the same way it revolves around a play as well, although this time Caine is the director and Reeve is an actor. They join veteran comedians Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers). Together, they demonstrate the calamities that happen with the bed cast and one-piece crew. On the surface, the movie seems to be mostly a clown thing, but by watching you discover that it's a lot of subtle jokes that require more than one view to capture. Wish this underrated movie was available on DVD.
