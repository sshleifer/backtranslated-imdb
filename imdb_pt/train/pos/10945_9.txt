Best show since Seinfeld. She's really very funny. His total self-centeredness, the great gay neighbors, the matches in music or cartoons, make this the newest show on TV. One of the few shows I care to watch. The scene with the wise old black woman in the pharmacy ("oh wait now you're near you look old" turns face with finger and goes away), overdose of cough syrup, sleeping with God, it's all so funny or So stupid is so much fun. The weaknesses of the shows are your sister and the police officer just because they are very normal! I really can not wait until the next show, something I have not felt in any show for a long time.
