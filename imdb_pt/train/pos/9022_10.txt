Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British TV show ever, the performances, the direction, the cast, the suspense, the drama ... everything is fantastic about it. <br /> <br /> Although the show dropped a little later in its last season, this movie ended the topics well and made an excellent story for the fans of the show and newbies. I can not recommend this movie more, find it and watch it. But I advise watching the first series, since the first two seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> An obvious (10/10)
