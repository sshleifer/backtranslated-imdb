One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points ... 1. Hugo Chávez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, his support comes mainly from the poorest regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup briefly deposed Chavez. At the time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, shooting a documentary about Chavez for British television. His film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath, and electrifyingly records the story unfolding locally, outside and inside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez intended to free Venezuela from US free market policies. Although Venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was run for private benefit by executives Chávez wanted to replace. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite being the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, Venezuela continues to be flooded by poverty, its resources literally sucked by foreign multinational companies. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins portraying the early years of Chavez as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity with the poor and its various policies that have become popular among local working-class people (educational plans, distribution of oil revenues, grassroots democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great advocate of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand this. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chávez came to power, he immediately undertook to redistribute profits from oil. This, understandably, made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private TV stations soon began to oppose the state-owned TV station. They questioned Chávez's motives, sanity and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the coup would not have been successful. The film makes it clear that scammers rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the pretext of "restoring democracy," the opposition silenced the state TV station, dissolved the National Electoral Junta, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and took control of the military. <br /> <br /> 11. Money-hungry interests, backed by the military elite (encouraged by the US and the CIA), organized a march of citizens in the presidential palace to effect the coup. The snipers fired at Chávez's supporters, but the private media edited the footage so it seemed the return fire was aimed at the opposition's march, which in fact had been safely diverted. <br /> <br /> 12. The police fired at Chávez's supporters, further bleeding the streets. <br /> 13. Chavez, held captive, refused to resign. Of course the media / government lied, saying he had resigned, but Chavez's cabinet members conveyed the truth to the international community, which eventually got the message back to Venezuela on cable. <br /> <br /> 14. The people revolted, pressing for the return of the president they had elected, whom only a referendum could replace constitutionally. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - With just over an hour, this document is very short. However, it is a catchy piece of journalism and deals with a form of "media war" that is rarely addressed. Makes a great companion for "The Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
