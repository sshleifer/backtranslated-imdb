The passport to Pimlico is a real treat for all fans of British cinema. It's not just a fun and entertaining comedy but it's a cinematic flashback from a bygone era, with attitudes and scenarios sadly now just a reminder of British life. Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico's resident Arthur Pemberton who, after the accidental detonation of a bomb that did not explode, uncovers a wealth of medieval treasures belonging to the fourteenth-century Duke of Burgundy that was buried deep in the depths of its small suburban street in the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> Treasure is an old legal decree signed by King Edward IV of England (which was never officially rescinded) to declare that that particular London street was declared a burgundy land, which means that, in the eyes of the law internationally, Pemberton and the other locals are no longer British subjects but natives of Burgundy and its tiny street an independent country in its own right and a law in itself. <br /> <br /> This defines the resistance suffered and impoverished by the war. If they put themselves in a good position, as they believe they are outlaws and English jurisdiction, in an act of drunkenness, they burn their ration books, destroy and ignore their clothing coupons, blatantly disregard British licensing laws, and so on. Great Britain. <br /> <br /> However, what happens is always spiv, black mercenary and dishonest thug follows the example and crosses the "frontier" in Burgundy as a haven of law and post-war restrictions to sell his dishonest goods, and half of London consumers follow them to avoid rationing, making their haven quiet and happy, a burglary's den and a little crowded. Appealing to Whitehall for assistance, they are said that due to developments, this is "now a foreign policy issue, which His Majesty's government is reluctant to get involved with", leaving the residents rich and dry. However, they declare the area as a legal frontier and as such have set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road, mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for residents of Pimlico. <br /> <br /> The border is completely closed, beginning a great siege, with the locals of Bugundia slowly getting without water and food, but never less struggling in true British style. As a resident Bugundian quotes, "we are English and we have always been English, and it is only because we are English, we are fighting so hard to be Bug√∫ndios" <br /> <br /> A feeling that soon reverberates around the world. capital city as when the rest of London learns from the poor situation of the Bugundians, everyone feels compelled to participate and help them by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire locks. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall, who fought against it <br /> <br /> So the invaders, over the centuries, can finally be brought to their knees by this new group of strangers, especially since these are English !!!! <br /> <br /> Great tale and lots of fun everywhere. To not lose.
