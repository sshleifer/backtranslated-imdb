This movie is of almost generation-defining importance for some of us born in the early postwar years (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending Saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie theater) you almost certainly saw it. And the memory of seeing this probably stayed with you. It's style is the material of a brief moment and somehow gloriously exciting in our growing days. <br /> <br /> He had a modern storyboard and space-time for the audience of his day. The setting was any town with a grocery store and a movie theater that would be packed for a midnight Friday show. There are hot rods and young rebels, but in the way of "why not let us have fun" instead of in the disturbed, histrionic way of rebellion without cause. All the characters were identifiable to us-teenagers, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the dog, even the cops-were sympathetic to us. We could relate to them all. <br /> <br /> He had a singularly horrifying monster. It is the first victim to be heard moaning "it hurts ... hurts" and we were convinced and scared. The threat is continually growing throughout history. There are intense periods of suspense, colorful effects, fabulous leadership in McQueen and moments of humor, both intentional and unintentional. He even had a sad part almost exaggerated to make the most sensitive of us feel like crying. <br /> <br /> I saw him in the summer, at 9, or so, with the phrase 'I Married A Monster'. From Outer Space ', and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular dual feature that I came back a few more times before leaving. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved.
