Reflections: pure delight from beginning to end. Not a laugh, but a more subtle and sophisticated humor. What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr .. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant is in sight of the building of his new house, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks if he wants his "loyalties scrawled," or something only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to sound ignorant, answers yes. With this, Barker shouts to his companions, "OK guys, he wants them cocked, then ... ROLL OUT!" A second later you hear the ripped and tearing sounds of about 20 large fingernails plucked from several planks. All Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is dated. You would never see that many carpenters work at the same time in a single family home, and such a place in Connecticut of all places would probably generate a few million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic movie that is really a treasure.
