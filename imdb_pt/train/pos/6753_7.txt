Otto Preminger's classic noir acts almost like a LAURA flop-side ... while the film was flashy and featured Clifton Webb's high clifton, this film is a lot more sewing. Dana Andrews is less than good cop who accidentally kills a man just to have him potentially trapped in the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving in a fast clip, so that lapses of logic are easily ignored. Andrews is very good (much less wood than he has ever been in the past) and the gorgeous Gene Tierney is unbelievably beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim. WHERE THE WALKING TOUR is a must see and a great addition to Preminger's equally shocking WHIRLPOOL (also starring Tierney).
