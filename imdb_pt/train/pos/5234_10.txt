After a bike ride that day, lying beside a lake in a nature reserve, spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small grove, this movie made perfect sense to me. The images from the movie were beautiful and that's all you need. Turn off the mind-conscious control button and the work done. <br /> <br /> I remembered Baraka (1992), but with the additional lesson from my previous paragraph. <br /> <br /> This comment requires a minimum of ten lines, ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines, but ten. After finishing the count of all the lines, you realize that there are less than ten, although less than ten lines is enough to make my comment.
