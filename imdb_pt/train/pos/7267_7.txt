Curly Sue is a 6 year old with an abundance of hair and a life as a hobo. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets being little crooks. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive parking garage while Curly will yell over lawsuits and pull for the victim. Turns out she's a very talented lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch) who is appropriately shocked at what she did. Not only do the scammers make some money, they spend the night in Gray's luxury apartment. Even so, Gray feels she owes them more so the three of them stay together for a spell. Gray only knows the lucrative business of law and nothing about life. Who better to teach her than Bill and Curly, those experienced experts in realities of life? But, all good things should come to an end and there is no life for a law expert and a couple of swindlers. Or is it there? This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as fun as Shirley Temple, but much bolder, of course. Belushi gives a rare and touching performance while his Luck and Lynch contract is bright as the arrogant but mild lawyer. John Hughes, as writer and director, shows us his magical touch once again, as the script is lively and unpredictable. Just watch Curly and Bill take Gray to spend the night with no money, and see the humorous results. Do you yearn for happy endings, long promised and finally delivered, with some uncertain moments in between? This is your custom made movie.
