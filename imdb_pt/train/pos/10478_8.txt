<br /> <br /> This is definitely a 'must see' for those who occasionally smoke a refrigerator in their secret hideout, trying to avoid getting caught by parents, teachers, the police, etc ... The protagonist is a lady of forty-somethings, living in her mansion, creating orchids, and utterly unaware of the fact that her husband, so rich and true, is indeed bankrupt and cheating on her. When he suddenly dies, she is confronted with the truth. The bailiff comes to tell you that she is in huge debt. She does not know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in Britain. She decides after a long time thinking of getting rid of her flowers and start to create pot instead ... The story is quite unique, the performances excellent! I can think of only a few movies that made me laugh more than that. Still, the melodramatic touch is present. The film is typically British: the jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence involved. It should not be mentioned that it is advisable to have some drafts before watching 'Saving Grace'. It will be much more fun! Especially the scene with the two ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. I thought my jaws would burst. 9/10
