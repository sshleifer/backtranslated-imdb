Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment is undoubtedly a star at first sight, it's a scary and disturbing look at the dark side of human nature. This movie goes straight to the point, you may be thinking at what point? The goal is to satisfy fans of extreme violence and violence. This movie has some blood, more or less just torturing women violently. There are only 3 scenes that can be considered bloody. I'll tell you one thing, though Coba: The Devil's Experiment makes Hostile look like Sesame Street. If you thought Hostile was a disturbing and brutal torture film, then you did not see half of it until you've seen the Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment. <br /> <br /> Rating of the movie 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea pig: the experience of the devil (uncut) ***** (7)
