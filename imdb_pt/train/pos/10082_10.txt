The film is truly poignant, unique and uplifting. History is universal in that it is a battle between good, evil and the world between them. The most important thing is that their classification is wrong, misleading and a farce. Blockbuster rated it as a X rated movie. The truth is that it is closer to G than to PG and should be seen by children who can read clear and simple subtitles.
