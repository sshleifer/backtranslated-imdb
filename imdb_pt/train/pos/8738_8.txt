Bugs Life is a great movie that is not just for kids but also for adults. The story takes place around a colony of ants and their fight against the evil locusts who come back every year and steal their food (A mirror of the seven magnificent). There is some wonderful computer animation and the voices are great as well. You will love!! 8 out of 10
