The Sunshine Boys is a fantastic comedy about two former vaudevillians who reluctantly get together for a TV special, despite the fact that they despise each other. <br /> <br /> The comic genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau are stellar! Some of the best scenes are when the duo are fighting over the silly and trivial things! The material is fast and witty, appealing to all ages. AMOUS SPOILER ALERT: There are a few slightly sad moments near the end of the film that deal indirectly with the effects of aging that gives the film a soft and sincere tenderness that shows to this critic that what the couple really more accurate to success is the other. <br /> <br /> If someone loves The Odd Couple, you'll love this movie. A great movie!
