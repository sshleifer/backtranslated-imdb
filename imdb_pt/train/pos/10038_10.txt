Titanic has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. She has her problems (which the movies do not), but it's still nice. When I come across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, my first reaction is "wait a minute, do not you? I know so many people who do not like this movie, and I'm not saying that I do not see why. "The love story is very tacky" well, yes, but is not it nice and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unreal, everyone knows love like that does not exist , But this is a movie, does not everyone like to watch a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? they do not realize all their potential.However, I find it unfair to say that they are terrible actors.I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie they are not surprising.But the roles that are given are simple, and the characters s seem real enough for you to care about them a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not go as well as one might expect. <br /> <br /> And finally, if someone will complain that they do not like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why the hell did they go and watch a movie which is so clearly all these things. It's like people who complain that the Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply because it's a movie, not because you do not like the genre, this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Well deserving of his Oscar, in particular, Best Photography, which I think is the best I have ever seen. seen in a movie, save perhaps the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings. I know that some of the writings fail, like the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the film. The flashback portion of the story can be pretty weak at times, but overall it's an incredible achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the wreck looks so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people do not like it. this movie, but in most cases, it is as if they do not like the fundamental idea, as if it were a love story, instead of thinking that the film itself is poorly constructed. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I have read more than five books on the Titanic, including memoirs from the day it happened, and this film is extremely accurate historically, save just a few flaws. The only major ones I can find is that the tubing should be copper with thread, not steel, and the iceberg looks pretty unreal as is the scene where they hit it. <br /> <br /> I give this 10/10 movie, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it's an excellent cinematic achievement that leaves a horrified feeling for the realistic adaptation of events.
