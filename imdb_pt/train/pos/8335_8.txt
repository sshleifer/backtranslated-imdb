While the flickering chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is enough reason to see this movie, the supporting cast (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the hilarious trio of Jacobi, Saks and Maher) is an added bonus. Matthau shines as Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's clinical fiance, and the Shalub line on Einstein's gonads is, as we have already noted, one of the highlights of the film. The speech Robbins makes in his first public appearance is pure poetry. Many compliments to writers for dealing with this foam with intelligence and levity. I also thought that Keene Curtis was wonderful like Eisenhower. This may be considered a kind of girl movie, but I think everyone is going to have fun with it. Eight very solid points.
