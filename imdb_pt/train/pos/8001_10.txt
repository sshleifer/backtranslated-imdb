Certainly one of the best movies I've seen for some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this movie a lot of fun and often exciting. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles, and the rest of the cast performs wonderfully well. Christopher Walken is obviously superb on his part, though he did not show up as often as I'd like. A story of supreme greed backfiring is offset by the innocence and love of a child. This is also a movie for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a sense of humiliation and corruption, which itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly thrilling movie from beginning to end. Highly recommended!
