With the death of GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought of the most interesting program, which, despite having only a short run, was a tremendous idea with good plots all over the place. Usually not seen for more than 40 years, it would be worth seeing again. The opening credits showed many different images, one of which was COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP, mounted on his famous rocket sled, at the point where he was often called "The Fastest Man Alive."
