Everything has been better in the last few days. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily. At the time of writing, I'm fourteen, but even in my teens I can not resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who actually lived under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called Fraggles who live incredibly on a rock. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species, such as the struggling Doozers and numerous live plants. Outside the rock lies the scientist inventor Doc and his dog Sprocket (who later befriends Gobo Fraggle), on the other side a family of supposed rulers of the Gorgs Universe. The five main Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (artillery and peaceful), Wembley (undecided and friend of Gobo), Boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and Red (loves anything that has to do with sport and general aggressiveness ) are caught up in some strange situations, each episode while at the same time singing and dancing their concerns. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family program - the plots may have intricate details that children may not follow well, but the music. The dance and dance routines will catch their attention. The characters are strong and kind, their conflicts are believable and their adventures are thrilling. The Gorgs are scary, Doc and Sprocket Enlightening, Uncle Traveling Matt hilarious (the postcard segments are very 80's!) And the final episode, Change of Address, genuinely touching. Let's get down to Fraggle Rock again!
