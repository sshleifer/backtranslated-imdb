Raoul Walsh's 1933 high-energy classic The Bowery puts the owner and operator of Wallace Beery's hall against bitter rival and dandy George Raft with the adopted street kid Jackie Cooper and Faye Wray in roles that play among their great rivalry. It's not clear exactly what the rivalry is, but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids. Lots of jokes at first, but the characters soften as the movie progresses. Also, it is the pure exuberance of the scenes in the Beery hall. The various characters, the sexy choir line, lots of booze, a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too restricted by the so-called pre-code restrictions, and then came the Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation itself. Everything creates a very vivid picture of a life that has passed for a long time. I do not like comparing eras, but this movie is completely different from anything you see today. The film has a lot of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutely a must see.
