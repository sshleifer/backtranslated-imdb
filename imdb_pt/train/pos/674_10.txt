Although for most people watching the movie, this will be of little interest, but of the many hundreds of films dealing with magic and occultism in one form or another, this is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <From Golem to Craft, the subject seems to be of infinite interest to the film industry. Most movies that play it somehow do it childishly (for example, "Witchboard," a real piece of trash in every way) or using the transcendental elements as cheap excuses for cheesy special effects or villains of clippings More often, the subject arises in a hysterical religious context (in the various films oriented to the Apocalypse, the Antichrist is inevitably a champion of some kind of new-age style practice.) Rarely, a movie seems to show at least a passing experience of magic as it is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the occult in such films may at best be described as allegorical and not literal, or symbolic, or just I am not certain. I've watched this movie again after many years tonight. I've seen it before on VHS, it's a somber, moody play, and after watching it on DVD, I'd say if you have any intention of watching this movie, watching it on DVD, I do not watch it on VHS. <br /> <br /> Darkness and bad mood are overwhelming on VHS, but on DVD the film takes on a very different tone. I think Weir has pushed the dark aspects intentionally into the style, but when the film is converted to the lower color medium of the VHS, it goes beyond the edge. The DVD gives life to the movie again and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> Anyway, seeing it as if it was the first time, I realized that the magic treatment is extremely good in this movie. It's hard to get into all the reasons why, I do not mind taking the time to do it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious, anyway, if you want to see how it is in real life, this movie is very sure on countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for those who are not, you really lost a lot of time reading up to this point.
