Another detailed work on the subject made by Dr. Dwivedi takes us back in time to the pre-divided Panjab. Dr. Dwivedi has chosen a difficult subject for his film debut. He worked on every meticulous detail to bring the story to life. The treatment of the subject is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Although we did not visit the area at that time, the scenarios and costumes look real. Unlike most partitioned movies, it does not focus on the bloody details of violence to attract audiences, but on its after effects. The characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee gave an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai acted with the heart showing the situation of a man full of guilt. The rest of the cast also did a good job.
