By the time the Lady of Shanghai was being made, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth was disintegrating. The film was both an effort by Welles to rekindle the old flames and to make a classic noir. Not well received at the time, The Lady from Shanghai has been increasingly acclaimed by critics over the years. It got better with age, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Welles is Irish sailor Michael O'Hara who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three robbers in Central Park. The sparks fly, but then comes the attrition, it ends the lady is married to cripple, but brilliant criminal lawyer Everett Sloane. However, Sloane seems to like Welles and hires him to run his yacht. <br /> <br /> So far, the movie is starting to sound very much like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not thinking now with his male member, he would have gone back to the seaman's recruiting room in Lower Manhattan. Instead, he engages in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself attached to two murders and Sloane as his eminent lawyer. <br /> <br /> Welles, for whatever reason, decided that his wife would be blonde in this movie. Supposedly Harry Cohn hit the roof as Rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair. That may have soured him in the film as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw Welles' vision of independent films threaten his power. Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner, Grisby, who is a viscous guy, he ends up in a corpse. The other corpse to be here is Ted DeCorsia, a private detective trying to feed himself. <br /> <br /> It's a good noir thriller, showing Rita her best glamor, even if she was blonde. On here. The last shot in the hall of the mirrors is beautifully staged, but I would not recommend seeing it if it is in some controlled substance.
