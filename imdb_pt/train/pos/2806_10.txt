Ok, first I hate to comment on it, but I felt I had to defend that movie. Many people were hitting on her and I felt that the people who might want to see should have a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, Bend It Like Beckham is not to be the deepest movie in the world. century. If this is what you are looking for, go somewhere else. Just because it's an independent film does not mean it has to be artistic. It is supposed to make you feel good and you should have fun watching and these two things are easily accomplished. <br /> <br /> Second, the performance though is not "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still good. The film does not have to act this way honestly, so do not look. It's a family movie. If this is what you wanted, you should not or should not be looking at this movie honestly. <br /> <br /> Finally, it has a really cute story. I think it's well thought out and it's fun to watch. It is also very true for life for the most part to this culture, so if you want to sit and watch a movie you can enjoy and feel good when you finish. If you are looking for something with deep plots and great dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
