Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a radical leftist from college. Mark is accused of killing a police officer during a riot on campus, and he flees all the way to the desert. He does this by stealing a small plane at the local airport and flies by himself. <br /> <br /> Once flying over the desert, Mark sees a car in the air. A young woman named Daria leaves and sees Mark circling the plane. Mark walks the plane over and over, causing Daria to get down or get hit. When he arrives, he becomes familiar with Daria, who is strangely enchanted by Mark's aerial highjinks. <br /> <br /> After engaging in a soulful conversation for hours, Mark and Daria get naked and make love in the sand. But with Mark avoiding the law, they realize he needs to keep running. Thus, the brief encounter of Mark and Daria is quite touching, because it does not develop into a complete novel. <br /> <br /> Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead of the early 70's. Both films have a vague and uneven quality, as well as meanings and complicated characters. Frechette was so reckless in person, as his character was in this movie. A few years after doing Zabriski Point, Frechette stole a bank in real life. While serving his prison sentence, Mark died an ignoble death. He was killed by a 150 lb. weight, which fell on him when he was lifting weight. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography and special visual effects. The incredible slow-moving scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion were a stroke of genius. Although not as innovative as Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still resonated with the counterculture of the early 1970s. I recommend it to anyone who likes avant-garde movies that show the upheaval of youthful rebellion in the early 1970s.
