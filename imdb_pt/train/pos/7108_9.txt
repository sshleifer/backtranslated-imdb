Do you like solving mysteries? Do you like complex narrations? This is for you. Brilliant, clever film by Francis Leclerc (son of a legendary French Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Flamboyant and clever editing is Leclerc's word, strongly aided by Roy Dupuis, who is dythirambic in the lead role. <br /> <br /> The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinarian in his 40s who just woke up from a coma after being disconnected by someone unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him when he was putting an end to the deer sufferings on the road. Throughout the fight, he behaves strangely and it seems that something has dominated him. <br /> <br /> It's not a scary movie, but it's very mysterious and well played. I have my hypothesis on the end (I think the Indian caused the crash), but this end was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that 9.5 / 10
