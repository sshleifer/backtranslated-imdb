It's been some time since I watched this LotR. At the moment, I'm looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is very faithful to the original work. The visuals are meshing and sometimes haunting. Disadvantages? Occasionally the movie is confusing or confusing. There is one or two times that the storyline slows down. But overall - buy this movie. It is great for kids, adults and collectors.
