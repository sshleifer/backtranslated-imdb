An amicus offer from Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ("The Far-Fallions", etc.) are transformed into a smart and intelligent "quadrilateral" with a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) all giving elegant performances despite a low budget that results in some 'non-special effects'. The most striking contribution, however, is that of 7-year-old Chloe Franks, which turns into a frighteningly effective account on her part, which causes someone's blood to cool. Just spoiled by the sinister title desired by the film by its distributors, this underrated release, a cut above the shocking movie 'blood' n 'guts', is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror.
