I first saw "Breaking Glass" when it was released in England in 1980 .. I loved it and after having captured it in August 2005 in a Canadian station is still great. The only thing I regret is that I can not find the soundtrack or the DVD in the stores ... Anyone worries about shedding some light or should I order it from some more expensive internet company. But back to the film the song stood the test of time, Hazel / Kate had something to say about Britain in the 1980s. In fact, it was the same decade that I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons being "Thatcher "and what she was doing for the country at the time. Please, if you have the chance to watch this movie, you will not regret it!
