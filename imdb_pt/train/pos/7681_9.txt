Child Sextingitation is one of the most serious problems facing our world today, and I feared that any film on the subject would go straight to scenes of an explicitly sexual nature in order to shock and disrupt the audience. After seeing "Trade" and "Holly," a movie motivated me to really want to see a change in international law. The other looked like a poor attempt to make me cry for five minutes with emotional music and the strange suicide. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that turning that question into a Hollywood movie is a useful or necessary strategy to adopt, and I must praise the 'Holly' brands for engaging subtly but mightily with the terrible conditions that these children are unfortunately forced to endure. The "trade" swung between the serious and the stupid, with scenes involving the death of a cat coming after pictures depicting children being forced to commit some horrendous acts. I found this uninteresting and sometimes offensive to the cause. If I wanted a cheap laugh, I would not have signed up for a movie about child trafficking. <br /> <br /> For anyone who would like to watch a powerful movie that really means something, I suggest you save money on movie tickets for the 'Holly' release.
