The film is dividing itself from the beginning, Eddie seems to bring this uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing, from an ice cream as a child, to the long, old family tradition. The film is very rare in this country, but I'm not sure of the availability in other countries. I've done research on a number of websites, and yet I've been unlucky, phoned companies looking for rare videos, and there are annual waiting lists for that. SO TIPS ARE VERY WELCOME. If someone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and watch the video, it's worth it and you can not go very far.
