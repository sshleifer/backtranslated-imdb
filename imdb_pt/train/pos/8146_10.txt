I can not stop saying how much I loved this movie. This movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The film follows the exploits of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). It goes from the beginning of the group to the end of the group, after it is tragic. Following the group is documentary filmmaker Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The film has a tight budget, but it does not seem to matter, this is a well-produced and well-produced film, and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main strength of this film is writing, there are so many brilliant lines and takeoffs in rap in this movie, it's unreal. <br /> <br /> Take off rappers like MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste and songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick) Etc) Rusty Condieff made an excellent film. In the film he plays the rapper Ice Cold. The movie does not come out, it's funny from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The movie works so well because, from time to time, it gets weird, but hits that line where it's funny without going too far. Listening to the three protagonists, try to say that some kind of philosophy was one of the best parts of the film, as Tone Def telling a record producer, when you take the bus, you get there, and the producer responds ?? This is profound! 'The group depicting the NWH has some kind of natural chemistry for them. They work so well together, and they manage to pull that movie where there is not a moment of the week in the movie. What really makes this movie so good is how true it is to some of the rap groups of the time this movie is. Many rap groups had problems with violence, with censors, and like the NWA, the group only became popular when the establishment began to make a big deal with the controversial lyrics. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's offensive. There is something here to offend everyone in a good-humored way. The film has a takeoff in a good number of people also out of rap, being the funniest of Spike Lee. Where they came with this dialogue I can not imagine. The movie has line after line that will make you roll on the floor. As I said before, the writing is simply excellent. <br /> <br /> It does not surprise me that this film has been released so narrowly. It's a clever, controversial and even thought-provoking film. This is too much for the mainstream, despite the fact that it is hilarious and almost flawless in its production. There are no big stars but many familiar faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Watch this movie, at least you'll definitely get an opinion on that.
