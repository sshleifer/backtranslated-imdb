I wonder what the audiences of the day thought when they set eyes on Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Certainly he looks like no one else at the time, that skull face, flat nose and elongated body - even now it remains a haunting presence. And what could be more appropriate than the rise of those miserable slums of New Orleans that seem to rot like the plague Blackie is missing in town. I'm just sorry he does not have any more scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is very skillfully assembled ?? the black morgue mood, the Widmark-Douglas interaction, the touristless places, the battles between the officers - all of this is entwined in a tense realistic thriller with a different threat from the others of the time. Even the house scenes of Widmark, which put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the sign, can not be very upsetting. Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for running a studio product (Fox) no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark does a solid discreet job as a public health officer. But my money is in the first and only Zero Mostel. There was once a sweaty interpreter who could shout louder or be pushed more than the bulky subject of the fall (eg, The Enforcer, 1950). That scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with the astute woman of Mostel (Liswood), is a jewel of frantic subservience, while Mostel tries to pacify them like a frenetic arcade. Too bad he missed so many years on the blacklist. (I wonder if it was the fickle Kazan who named him.) <br /> <br /> But it's not just the professionals who add color. The locals add character and authenticity, especially the two Asians interviewed by the police. That whole scene has a makeshift air, as if Kazan recognized its potential and created a small scene on the spot. So also, that colorful saloon with all hands on the deck is pure inspiration. And what about the flea-filled cafes that take me to the nearest Denny's? <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film is still a fascinating and fascinating thriller, with an apocalyptic air that strangely surprises many of today's mega. -exitos.
