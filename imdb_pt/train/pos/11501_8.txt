I barely remember this show, a bit, but I remembered that it was great! My older brother reminded me about the show recently and I had seen an ad for the set of D.V.D coming out. The net once again erred by pulling it out of the air, so they could put what else in their place? It should have been at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? Sometimes I think network executives think they are the "gods" of the entertainment world. But they mistakenly guess and end up losing good show placement from time to time. Let it be said that they have far more failures than 'hits'. This was one of the bad decisions to cut from the line-up. Anyway, I'm getting this for my collection.
