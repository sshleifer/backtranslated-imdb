Ashanti is a type of film of the 70's (1979, to be precise). This reminded me of the Wild Gees in a way (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It's a really good movie too, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a doctor who works in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) who trained. in medicine in America and he is also a doctor. While they are medicating, one day she is taken by slave traders working for an Arab slave trader named Suleiman (played by Peter Ustinov, of all people). The rest of the movie is David trying to get it back. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is a brilliant actor, of course, and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back, but rather desperate with weapons and action stuff. He is first aided by an Englishman who campaigns against the slave trade that nobody recognizes to be happening (Rex Harrison!), Then briefly by a helicopter pilot (William Holden), and then by an Arab named Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a score to deal with Suleiman (he's very intense everywhere, a very engaging character), and then leaves with David to find him and bring Anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which David fails miserably in catching your camel <br /> <br /> So there's a lot of adventure. There are also many moral questions. The progress of the story is somewhat predictable from this point on, and there are some freedoms taken with plotting to move things faster, but it's all very forgivable. The point is, David will arrive at Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells it to Omar Sharif (yes, of course Omar Sharif is in it!)?
