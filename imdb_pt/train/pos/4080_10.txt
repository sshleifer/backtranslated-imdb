This is one of the best family animation films of all time. Moreover, virtually all of the serious title rivals came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other major films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service". Spirited Away is very good but a bit scary for typical family food - best for teenagers and adults alike. The only thing that defines "Laputa: Castle in the Sky", in addition to other Miyazaki movies, is that it is much more an adventure tour full of tension. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is really engaging and engaging. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but decidedly obscure or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often spasmodic, stylized and youthful. None of these troubles Castle in the Sky. It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well-designed, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of those trench coats wearing posers) There is a lot of adventure but no blood and blood. The animation is smooth, detailed and composed by a cinematic ally - not many flat plugs. The scenarios are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The voice in the dubbed English version is first rate, particularly the two, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is great too. Use your studio sound if you have it. <br /> <br /> One aspect I particularly liked is that much of the background story is left unexplained. Laputa has already been inhabited and is now abandoned. Because? We never know. We know how much we need to know, and then we have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized. In fact, it is fair to say that the world is more fully understood than most of the secondary characters, who are mostly one-dimensional characters of actions (eg rude general, foolish helper, old and crazy miner, etc.) Highly recommended for people from 6 to 60 years!
