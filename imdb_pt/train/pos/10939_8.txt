The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery. There are all the usual tell-tale signs of a kung-fu movie: great choreography, horrible dubbing, different "styles" of fighting and a wide range of exaggerated human emotions, often filled with cheese. However, the plot certainly is better than average. It's interesting and keeps your attention on all the scenes without a fight. Occasionally, it is even able to arouse the public, as when character X receives a horrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I love about Five Deadly Poisons is the beautiful simplicity of the moral and themes of the film. Almost everyone understands what is coming to them. The cowards, greedy and corrupt lose. The thugs, consumed by selfish greed, end up being destroyed by their own betrayal and betrayal. The good guys use teamwork, planning, and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top. <br /> <br /> Rocks of the Poison Clan!
