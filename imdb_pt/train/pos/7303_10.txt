I only got to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being made almost 30 years ago, I thought the scary moments would be pretty tame. Boy was I wrong. There are some great moments that caused shivers down the spine. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was superb. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, it may be a bit slow to start, but once it's going, there's no stopping it. It does all the imitators, for example. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream seems very tame. I really can not say it's the best of Carpenter, because I have not seen many of his, the only one I can remember is Starman (I think he succeeded). Halloween is the greatest achievement of the horror genre.
