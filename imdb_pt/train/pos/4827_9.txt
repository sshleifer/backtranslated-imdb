And that's why historical / biographical films are so important to all of us, moreover, when they are so well made, like this! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "The Young Victoria", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got a lot more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is simply EXCELLENT as Victoria (who would say that!) and she will probably be named this year as Oscar. Personally, I'm rooting for it ... For technical reasons, I am pleased to say that it is a very successful production with wonderful Art Direction / Scenography and, of course, if it is, a great Periodic Figurine! <br /> <br /> The only downside is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen, but most of all, amazing woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
