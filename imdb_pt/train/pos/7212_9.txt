I would not hesitate to put this 'Death Trap' adaptation on a list of the top 5 film adaptations for the film of all time. Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never had the chance to do more than soggy novels and "Superman") plays against each other very well here. Even Dyan Cannon - whom I normally do not care about - is perfectly scaled up in a role that explores her amount of annoyance as an actress. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure whether comparisons of "Deathtrap" with "Sleuth" - another brilliant stage-to-screen adaptation with Michael Caine - are valid, or even fair. Yes, the two stories have much in common. But "Sleuth" is much more than that. about class war as the battle of judgment, and the house on "Sleuth" is defined at least as a character in the film as the two actors - the house does not really have a Deathtrap equivalent. And "Deathtrap" is not so much a battle of intelligence as a vignette of how people are not good (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. I'll just say that both films are excellent examples of the genre, and are worth their time and money. This is America, after all. You do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> I will not give the plot twists, but I do not think it matters anyway. I've watched the DVD eight or nine times in twelve years, and I still enjoyed the chemistry, the timing and the creepy, scary moments when things happen "all pear-shaped." Everything is done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who likes black heart comedy and suspense in the Hitchcock style of making movies will probably like Deathtrap immensely.
