I recently rented this document, having remembered hearing about it on the wiki and being intrigued by the premise. I knew very little about any of these bands, but I remember hearing The Dandy Warhols' "Not If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth" years ago and enjoying it. That said, this is my perspective on the doc: <br /> <br /> One thing I found incredible about this movie is that there is no need to have prior knowledge of any of these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film. I quickly became groove to the lives of Anton and Courtney, as well as their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think this is part of what makes this doc so good, and what makes Ondi Timoner a master documentary. <br /> <br /> I also loved how the "story" of these bands was told. Most of what you see is from touring bands. Both bands start playing in small spaces and struggle to get into the music industry. Throughout the film, each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. However, this is what makes the two bands similar and hence the brilliant prospect of how two bands of a feather can go in such different directions. <br /> <br /> I would basically recommend this to ANYONE who likes movies in general. . You do not need to have a special love for documentaries or any of the bands. An appreciation for music helps, but the music itself takes second place to the love / hate between the Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
