Such a delicious movie! Too much heart warming up. One can not help but fall in love with Gigi's character. He is adorable as a child and becomes a sensitive artist. The whole movie revolves around him. Does he live in a wonderful world? living all life curiosity, desire and anticipation. There is an older brother who tries to steal his glory, but remains in the shadow all his life. The father is very stereotypically Italian and so is the mother. Did I want Dad to come and meet his mother at the last scene? and make them cry and laugh. I also wish there was at least something redeeming about the big brother. His personality seems to have been totally destroyed. Passion and ardor? this is the key to life. And looking through the camera? concentrating on small details and savoring the delicate details of life.
