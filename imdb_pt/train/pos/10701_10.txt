Critics did not like this movie. He bombed the United States and, as a result, received only a limited display in Britain. Which was a great shame, because it represents British humor, not American, and should have been exhibited in Britain first. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman looks impressive and is a totally convincing Russian. Ben Chaplin is Dustin Hoffman's character in 'The Graduate', and 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes reminiscent of the classic 60's viewer (though it's a totally different story!). <br /> <br /> It changes course several times, from comedy to black comedy, from suspense to adventure - but it is memorable, moving and a breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget blockbuster. <br /> <br /> See you with an open mind!
