A country-boy Aussie-Rules (Mat) goes to town the night before a major AFL test match, where he must be picked up by his cousin. And then things go wrong. The uninjured cousin got involved in a drug deal involving the local loan shark / drug dealer Tiny (who looks like any gangster anywhere, but definitely Australian). Needless to say, Mat gets entangled in chaos, and it does not take long for the thoughts of tomorrow's game to drift into the back of his mind as the frenzied events of the night unfold. <br /> <br /> Accomplished Western Australian professional Shakespeare actor Toby Malone presents himself as a naive young Mat, and performs well a role well below his age. The best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, and a fun role from David Ngoombujarra as one of the cops after the events. The roll is fast, often funny and worth using an hour.
