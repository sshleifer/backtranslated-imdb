Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. A performance worthy of Oscar consideration, but again avoided by the Academy. Mr. Grant walks through the whole array of nonsense in this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to leave the big city. The pitfalls of building a house are well narrated and have become the base (loosely) for Tom Hanks' most modern vehicle, "The Money Pit." <br /> <br /> If you like good old comedy without the curse and free sex, this movie is a must see.
