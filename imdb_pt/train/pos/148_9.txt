Like his previous film, "In a Glass Cage," Agust√≠ Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic screen that is even more visually refined than its predecessor. This is one of the most visually accomplished and amazing images anyone could see. Increased drama, intensity, and tone of violence threaten what is melodramatic or farcical, but never enters it. In this way, it produces an almost impossible feat: to be so exaggerated and yet contained with so much pain, to be so charged and at the same time underestimated, and even the explosive ends are virtuous banquets of the eyes. No shame, beautiful and very tense ... this movie is simply superb!
