Peaches is truly a wonderful movie. I write this to refute a comment from someone called 'Auscrit', which appeared on this site. First, the idea that Monahans' first film, "The Interview", is somehow the TV is an extraordinary statement. Here is a movie that was praised all over the world, as it is simply one of the best Australian films ever made. He deserved to win the best picture. Peaches is a brave, brave and courageous match. For me it works on all levels and I've seen it twice. Monahan is a filmmaker who demonstrates great skill and incredible sensitivity. For 'Auscrit' make the comment that is another TV movie etc and that Hugo Weaving is not good simply does not 'catch' the movie. Or more particularly do not want to get it. Frankly, it's the kind of comment you'd expect from another filmmaker who's jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from within the industry is for distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average punter, I just did not write comments like that. I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the movie Sommersault. One must imagine what people think they are looking at. Unfortunately in Australia at the time the SS was released, the push was, if you did not like it, then there was something wrong with you, not with the movie. This manipulation of the media is quite common. The reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights to passing movies. Unfortunately for me SS is a movie about nothing, which could have been said in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional movie about anxiety. Peaches in comparison is a masterpiece. Personally, I can not wait for what Monahan does next, as he is clearly ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. In conclusion, if the film does not win all the awards of the AFI and IF, then it is a manipulated game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive with your time
