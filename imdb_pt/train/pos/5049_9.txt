I had to see this gem twice to really enjoy it all. When a widowed father of two interrupts his two sons' sleep with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing in him and not. As the horrifying events of this tale unfold, we learn a great deal about the father, his two sons, and his destinies. With a shocking twist after a shocking touch, this movie never allows a pause in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father, but the most notable performances are from his eldest son, Fenton, played by Matthew O'Leary and his younger son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumpter. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while, and you'll want to watch it a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot. I give this movie a 9/10.
