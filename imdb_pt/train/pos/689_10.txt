maybe I identify with this movie because I live in New York and I suffer from bad insomnia, but whatever it is, I must compliment the filmmaker on an incredible job. do what she did without a budget ... wow, that's all I can say. very good indeed. as if no money was spent on this movie and it still surprised me. I would definitely suggest checking out if you can. excellent direction, fantastic score and of course a script that will hit your butt. Look.
