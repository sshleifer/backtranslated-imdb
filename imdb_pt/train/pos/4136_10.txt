I became quite passionate about Laurence Olivier in the last few weeks, and I was thrilled when I discovered this gem. I always find it wonderful when I come across a movie in which I do not have to have my finger on the remote in case of nudity raises its ugly head. Lady X's Divorce is charming by the end scene, and must have been a real treat to the viewers in 1938. I just wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of horrible conversation that people call funny. <br /> <br /> Lady X's Divorce is well worth anyone's time.
