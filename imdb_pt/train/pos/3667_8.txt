Hollywood North is a satirical look at the time of the history of Canadian cinema, when the Canadian government offered huge tax incentives for films made in Canada. Most of the time, it was treated as a tax shelter or an inexpensive way to make American movies. For example, Porky came out of it. Matthew Modine plays a rookie producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved Canadian romance. However, to get the money, he needs an American star. He picks up a loose cannon and finds he needs to commit himself to the point where the film no longer resembles the book he was originally based on. He plays well in Canada but can not be understood outside the Great White North. Americans will think that we are satirising ourselves, but we will fail to realize that we are actually satirizing them. For Canadians 8/10 to the rest of the world 5/10.
