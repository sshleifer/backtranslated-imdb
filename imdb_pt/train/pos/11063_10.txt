I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne's "Waitress" (2007). This film only confirms what was clear in that film. Adrienne was a wonderfully talented writer and director, an original and unique artist. She was able to show the miseries of everyday life with an absurd humor and a really optimistic and humanistic bent. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a fantastic performance as a woman who has fallen on the edge. Male leader Reg Rodgers, looking like Judd Nelson, is fine. There is also a great special participation of Ben Vereen. The song at the end of Adrienne's "The Bastard Song" may be an optimistic compliment: "It's a world of suffering, in a sea of ​​pain, <br /> <br /> No matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> You're attacked by the rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not let the heartless take it down, <br /> <br /> Do not greet the heartless at your door, <br /> <br /> Do not live among the heartless "
