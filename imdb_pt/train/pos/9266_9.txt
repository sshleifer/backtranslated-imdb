Oh, the best and funniest film about female football fans, just slightly better than the saga of a teenage illusion of 1982 set in North London (qv). By the way, I just saw this on Film 4 [2008-12-21] and I'm regretting my inability to set the PVR). <br /> <br /> This is easily my second favorite football movie after "Mike Bassett: England Manager", but this time with the added touch of looking like a piece of guerrilla film from a team that apparently continues to do movies that are banned in the country where they are made (just think about the little where the girls are taken from the stadium, just as the sun is setting: fast reactions everywhere). <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud, but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls into the bathroom while he forced her to wear an improvised mask made with an Ali Daei poster, Eu I could not stop waking the others in the house with my snores, especially when the young soldier misunderstood my grandfather's requests for assistance ... Speaking of the bathrooms, I just wanted to be able to speak Farsi as soon as I could work writing on the bathroom walls (yes, there were some scribbles in Roman script, but they mostly referred to shocking American rock bands). <br /> <br /> In addition, in the rural-and-Farsi theme area, do not you think Omid Djalili sounds like a yokel when he speaks Farsi? Listen to the custodial sergeant in this movie and then go "Yes." <br /> <br /> I will not talk about Iran's sexual politics, and I will not talk about the dubious acting; My love for this film comes from the script and the editing: top quality stuff. <br /> <br /> Here's a list of my best favorite football films: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. Those Glory Glory Days 4. A Shot at Glory 5. The Mystery of Arsenal Stadium
