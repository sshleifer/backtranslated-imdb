I really liked Girl Fight. It's something I could watch over and over again. The acting was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job on the film. Very convincing, I can say. The film shows how women should defend what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion and so much hatred at the same time. Dealing with an ignorant father did not really help her much. Even if he loved her, he was really hateful. Her mother died when she was younger and this also put some sadness on the paper. The love story was a part that I really liked about the movie as well. I felt the passion you had for each other. Then again, the drama sets in and then it's like she's choosing between her boyfriend and her long dream of life. I thought it turned out just right. It was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for them. For all people who enjoy a movie based on a sport with a good plot, I suggest you check this out.
