<br /> <br /> I once saw No Man's Land (1987) - IMDB Link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found it okay. The film is about a guy who steals only Porsches. Gone in Sixty Seconds comes 13 years later and adds nothing to it. In fact, there are many worthless scenes. And the ending is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used ...
