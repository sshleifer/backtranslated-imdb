Interesting, fast and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those people who watches loads and loads of television. I stumbled into this show while I was sick at home with a serious case of flu one day, and I was immediately hooked. I developed a fall for John Burke. Both he and Claire did an incredible job of hosting the show together. You could really say that they both loved their jobs. <br /> <br /> The super-collector segments were excellent. I found myself interested in things I had never given a single thought to. <br /> <br /> What I really want to know is: what happened to Jack the dog? Has any of the hosts adopted him?
