This is a masterpiece in B / W 35mm film. The movie makes you see a weird way to start the day at 7:35 in a bar and how much things can happen in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The short surprisingly takes you to a complex story using very few elements and step by step makes you realize that something is not quite right. It expresses a lot, it makes your adrenaline boost with subtle details, and it's incredibly understandable to anyone, not just to the movie experts. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: European shorts, black and white and low budget. Do not let this scare you. It is worth being seen by anyone, not just experts of the genre. <br /> <br /> It's not much to tell, since the movie only lasts 8 minutes (exactly), and I do not want to spoil it. But I just watched online and could not understand why nobody took a few minutes to post a comment about it. <br /> <br /> Really worth watching. 10/10.
