<br /> <br /> Shot shortly after the war, this story was made to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war. It ended up receiving the honor of being the first Royal Premiere after World War II. <br /> <br /> Notably, the film involves the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud Psychology, the founders of America and several others up the long stairs (special effects in their infancy) and beyond the celestial gates without losing their integrity . <br /> <br /> Although it seems absurd, this clever script takes and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the ability of a mountain goat and presents a lovely facility rarely combined in the cinema ever since. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show !!!! <br /> <br /> British cinema must weep when it remembers how good it was in those early postwar years. <br /> <br />
