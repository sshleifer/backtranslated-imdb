I love this show. Period. I have not watched too long, probably only about six months, actually, but now it's my favorite show and it will probably be for quite a while. I love all the characters except that I do not care about Donna. I'm not completely sure why. I just do not think she's funny, and I do not think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Beyond it, I find the rest of the cast very good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who were Erics's parents, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I did not completely hate the eighth season. I still watch, and it makes me laugh. But, if you compare it to the previous seasons shows, it's not good. Randy is horrible. The ending was decent, not surprising, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but that's fine. I have the fourth season on DVD, and one day I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Some of their most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were 'Dine & Dash', 'Grandmas Dead', 'Red & Stacey' and 'Streaking', but I love all the episodes I've seen so far, which is most of them , I think . =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend. =]
