This is the best film version of the classic Dicken tale. I've seen this several times on VHS and recently got the DVD version, which is formatted for TV (not widescreen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors that are now recognizable, since many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "Equalizer" as the Ghost of Christmas Present. .
