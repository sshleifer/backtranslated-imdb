Deathtrap gives you a twist on every turn, every turn, in fact, your biggest problem is that there are so many twists you're never really oriented in the movie, and often it does not make sense, though they usually catch you by surprise. The story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists and turns. The script is very good with great dialogues and characters, but you can not catch the whole development because of the twists and turns. The performances particularly by Caine are amazing. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can drive. The visual effects are fair, but again, most are actually in a game and are false. It twists a lot, but it still works and it's worth watching.
