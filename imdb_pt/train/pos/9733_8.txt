'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' is a fun, yet loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a great title to help fill the line's requirements in IMDb reviews! The basic essence is the same as the book with certain dramatized incidents, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodized. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essentially annoying person, is his funny and funny self and carries the movie. It's strange to think that a few years ago he was just a TV show face and now he's getting in the way of Hollywood names. There's a good supporting cast and it's a fun and easy watch - a kind of masculine but funniest 'Ugly Betty'.
