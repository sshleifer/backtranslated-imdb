In my opinion, GUY THING is a hilarious, witty, sexy, romantic and totally beautiful movie that guys will also enjoy. I found Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled like a bewildered fiance and his future cousin sexy. If you ask me, they lit the screen like magic. You can also feel their chemistry between them. Before finishing, I would like to say that the performances were top notch, the direction was impeccable, the production design was good, the cast was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed. In conclusion, for anyone who is a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles, I highly recommend this movie. You have lots of laughs and emotions, so go to the rental store, rent it or buy it, relax with a friend and watch.
