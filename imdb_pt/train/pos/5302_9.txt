This movie kept me constantly entertained. In comparing this with Serial Mom, Mr. Waters came back to his bravest side. This is not so polished. <br /> <br /> There's a dark side here. A message about how success and fame transform a person - but more importantly, how it changes the people around them. <br /> <br /> There is not a false moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> Characters are a bit of a cartoonist ... but I want to believe that's what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It's fascinating to see how Mr. Waters has evolved ... This is really his best work.
