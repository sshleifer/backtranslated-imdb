I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad guy. I was not sure I would like him that way. And I was not sure if he could do that. But that surprised me. He sent shivers down my spine and made me take a closer look at the people on the street. The film is captivating and fast. Bruce Davison is compelling, but all he can really do is a cool guy. The real talent here is Thomas. The ending was a little awkward, but maybe that's how real people would fight ... If you're a fan of Thomas, you MUST see him here at his best, being bad!
