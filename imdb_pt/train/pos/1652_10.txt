This series put me in the writing of Deighton and the genre when I was younger and love this presentation of the story. However, I disagree with the above comment. From what I've read in the past, it's not Holm's performance that led Deighton to refuse to have the series released, but the massacre that all three books received in translation to the screen. A great example of this is the rewriting of the frontier crossing that ended Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield has never been in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border. This whole plot is cloth. Changes in the set damage similarly to the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he portrayed Samson's disorientation during the desertion of his wife in an excellent way and I believe he behaved well in portraying the aged field agent trying desperately to overcome class division. Samson pays for his father's idealism and suffers because of his influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, if he had gotten an education, he would probably be running the department. I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything. Holm is diminutive when compared to Samson's book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence.
