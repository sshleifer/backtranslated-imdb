There were many science fiction films from the 1950s. They were great attractions for the Drive-in movie theaters. Many of them were bad even back then. This movie and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' stand out, and both have aged well in their own way. From the beginning, with its sinister musical track theremin (which still sounds strange, since theremins are rarely used). The Forbidden Planet takes you where no man has gone before. Speaking of Star Trek, there is a lot of material in this movie that went into Star Trek TOS as a pilot for the series; interactive captain / first mate / doctor, mad scientist, alien beings, short skirt baby, computer intelligence; is all rigeur now, but this was the first of its kind. In addition, it has a good performance and a well-made work of art, which until today evokes a certain astonishment with the image. Consider how the huge Krell machine is portrayed successfully with some real depth. I saw this as a kid (on a drive-in: 0) when it was a new movie and it scared me. Of course all the movies were even vaguely scary at the time, but I remember being really worried about the invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that a science fiction fan can watch over and over again and find something new on each showing.
