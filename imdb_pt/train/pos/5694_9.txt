Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are great. I've seen Kilmer in The Doors, however his interpretation of John Holmes is superb. Nothing compared to Boogie Nights, which was kind of slow. Wonderland is a movie that is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective of a guy who is just indulged in his drug addiction and indolent of what goes on around. At the same time, the character of John Holmes shows a very clever cheater who is able to go through the most unpleasant and ugly situations almost unharmed. The film deserves to be seen more than once. The sexy, drug-filled seventies environment is incredible.
