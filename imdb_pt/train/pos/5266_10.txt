Well, some people would say that this particular movie stinks ... but hey! This is not right, it's not right in al ... The movie may not have the best special effects, and may not have the best actors (Except the Barbarian Bros exelence). Dispite this little fact, I can honestly say that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all!
