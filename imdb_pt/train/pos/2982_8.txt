I really liked this movie. I firmly believe that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time. They have the incredible ability to add this level of nonsense to pop culture and make it ridiculous, but in a realistic way ... if that makes any sense. This is mainly what makes South Park soooo funny. After you have passed from the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet design of all time, you see in each episode the message being conveyed. This is evident in BASEketball. Although it is directed by David Zucker and is absolutely ridiculous, it has a sincere message about corporate America and the doom that is the main league sport. I'm also a sports fan, so I find this movie hilarious at times because it's so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love. The opening prologue is brilliant ... tears of laughter form every time I see those soccer players start Riverdance! Some may not like this movie because it's not just everyone's cup of tea ... but just like South Park, once you look beyond the absurd ... you have a truly genuine message that is conveyed through the literary genius . I gave this film 8 out of 10 stars.
