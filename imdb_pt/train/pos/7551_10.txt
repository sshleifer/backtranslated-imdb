Best animated film of all time. This film explores not only the vast world of modern animation, with absolutely amazing effects, but also the branches of human mind, soul and philosophy. The story features a family of cats, where the older sister dies, the younger brother sees it and rescues her body, but when she wakes up, she is soured. Then the two brothers cats embark on a journey to find him. I have related this journey to many things. The history of the world, the bible, the cycle of life, and every time I watch, I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not so in the physiological aspect then you will still love it. The animation is great, and the creative scenes will attach it to the screen. For example, the ocean freezing in time, God eating earth soup, a strange and slightly SNM version of Hansel and Gretel. To conclude, Cat Soup is an absolute treat for anyone. <br /> <br /> PS - Not for children, including gratuitous violence.
