Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series). The cast had chemistry and they seemed genuinely like each other. This made many of his weaker stories work much better than they should. He has also turned many of his best stories into major Western dramas. <br /> <br /> Like any show that was recording more than thirty episodes each season, there would certainly be some weak ones. However, most of the time, each episode had an interesting story, some kind of conflict, and a resolution that generally did not include violence. While Bonanza was a western, the shooting was never presented as the main attraction. While I'm a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; these shows usually ended with a gunfight. The shootings were how many westerns solved all the conflicts, and Bonanza was very different in the attempt to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza, there are some interesting episodes that feature a lot of shootings. These episodes contrast with the rest of the series, but they are very good in themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, Guy Williams was brought in to replace him. Williams was playing the part of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay another year, and so Williams was written out of the series when he moved to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams had stayed during the Bonanza period, one can imagine how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when Pernell Whitaker left the show. <br /> <br /> No doubt, since Pernell Whitaker set off the series, the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks. Whitaker often played heavy on many episodes, and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play the good boy, and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. As Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, this did not leave much room for any gunfight. <br /> <br /> At some point they hired a ranch hand named Candy (David Canary) who became their fourth member. of the cast, but Candy was never featured in any shootings, and he was no more than an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two they also had Ben with another lost cousin (Jamie, played by forgettable Mitch Vogel) who was a teenager who was often getting into some kind of trouble with someone. <br /> <br /> Apparently By adding the teenager, the studio sought to attract younger viewers. It also gave writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, delinquency, etc. These kinds of preacher episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction from the establishment media to the anti-culture movement. The dragnet was probably the most popular source for law and order TV, although the Hawaii 5-0, The F.B.I. and many other shows also tried to jump-start the show by making TV shows that showed irresponsible teenagers causing evil, disorder and crime. <br /> <br /> The addition of a teenager to the cast gave the Cartwright more chances to show and solve problems, but these episodes look very artificial and are not very good in general. After Dan Blocker died, the series began to drag on for another year before being canceled. The last season was very bad as he counted on Little Joe tracking down his wife's killers, and most of the episodes were a bit depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or remembering how much he loved his wife, and how unfair she was dead. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've ever seen the last episode of the series, and I wonder if they've officially gotten involved in any way. Last year, there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) living in the Ponderosa, since Adam had moved (and never came back even once as a guest) and Hoss had died and little Joe had left after his wife (in the series) was killed by homeless people. <br /> <br /> In general, the era of 1959-1965 is the best of this series. After Adam left, he slowed down. Most shows before 1970 are also very good. In 1970, the series tried to be difficult to be current and current, and had lost much of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenager also diluted the overall quality of the show, and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the last nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and of the 465 episodes that have been produced, at least a hundred of them are excellent western dramas! This is a good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than many other TV shows.
