<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie on DVD and watched it the first time the other night. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for about 4 years since I graduated from high school. I did not grow up in this movie ... maybe my mother kept me from that. Definitely not for kids. Not that it's bad in a graphic sense, but that subjects would pass for most of the heads of 10 years. Overall, the animation was excellent considering this was done in 1978/1979. I thought the story followed the book reasonably well in a loose sense. But I'm bothered that Bashki not only added another 40 minutes or so, and added the parts of the Return of the King. That would make the movie final. I was bothered by the abrupt end, and when I heard the Return of the King suck, I was even more annoyed. Too bad it was not a great animated film. You may have gotten a higher vote from me. I give it to 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will do justice to the books with the new live action LOTR.
