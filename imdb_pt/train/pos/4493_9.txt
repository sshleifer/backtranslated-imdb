This is an excellent film about a traditional working-class family in the north of England. Filmed in Bolton, he stars James Mason as the father who is the dominant force within his house. Or so it seems. Cleverly, the film, based on the play, portrays the complexities of family life. The support cast is also fantastic, with many family faces supporting.
