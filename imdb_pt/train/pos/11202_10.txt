At first, I thought the Ring would be a more than normal movie with the common plot. How surprised I was! Of course, the plot is simple - a girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings us on a silver platter, with laughter and fear, with compassion and anguish. The way he describes the popular crowds at the fair, the force of the girl's attraction to both men, the tragic elements that come along with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest films (North by Northwest, The Rope, etc. The master did this even before he was thirty!
