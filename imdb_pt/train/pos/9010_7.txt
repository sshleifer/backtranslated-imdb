A bit quirky and bordered on bad taste; but smart enough to be worth watching. A young woman in a wheelchair Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) joins a reluctant caretaker, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who dreams of human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and wants to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent and dying Jane, who suffers from a neurological disease that has almost left her speechless and with few motor skills. With a wheelchair and full of spirit, her last wish is to lose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard, who will not help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this film ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has a certain charisma and sympathy.
