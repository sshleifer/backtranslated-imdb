saying this, I want to say that this is not a movie well done but it is a very good version of the actual event and the best representation so far. And if you are a WW2 fan then this is a treat for you because there are three of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie. It is theater, at best, but then this is still as said before a semi-documentary. <br /> <br /> I personally am a big fan of our almost human heroes of World War II, and there must be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did, will not be forgotten by the next generations. Because today kids do not read books, they watch movies. <br /> <br /> So if you want an action extravaganza, rent Private Ryan, this is the truth about persistent pain, outrageous resistance and the will to fight when all seems lost.
