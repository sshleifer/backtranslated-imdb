Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie. There are many funny moments (including a hilarious and disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, there is a "dead zone" in the middle where all the heavy stuff "she's breaking up with me" happens, but besides, it's still funny to the end. <br /> <br /> Although the plot revolves around fanaticism in relation to the Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sports. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course it's easy for me to say: I've been a Red Sox fan since I was a kid too. <Br/> <br /> 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Barky
