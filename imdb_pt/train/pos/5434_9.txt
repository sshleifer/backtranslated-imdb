The film was filmed on Movie Flats, near Route 395, near Lone Pine, California, just north of the road to Whitney Portals. You may even find splinters of cement and iron beams plastered on the rocks where the sets were built. And you'll recognize the area of ​​any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with the plot, since I'm sure it's covered elsewhere. The film stars three athletes - Fairbanks Fils, who must have learned a lot from his father - Grant, an acrobat in his youth - and MacLaughlin, a professional boxer from South Africa. His physical abilities are all on display. <br /> <br /> No moment in this movie should be taken seriously. These are Thugees, a sect in India, from which comes our English word "bandit". I can not go past the happiness of this film, but I should probably point out that the director, George Stevens, was a polymath with experience in Laurel and Hardy films - see his choreography of the fighting scenes - and went on. to the infinitely long dissolutions of Shane and The Diary of Anne Frank. The dynasties went up and down. Geological times erupted and disappeared, while Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed on "A Place in the Sun". Here, in his comic mode, he stands out. <br /> <br /> This is a male bonding story and it would be easy - too easy - to read homoeroticism in it, as many people do with Howard Hawks. Or women's hatred. But it's nothing like that. Sometimes the things portrayed on the screen do not deserve much heuristic attention. Men will form ties working together in a way that women do not. (Women share secrets.) Read Deborah Tannen, no one's idea of ​​an anti-feminist. Well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have produced. For most of the history of mankind - about nine tenths - hominids were hunters and gatherers, and men tend to hunt and women to gather. Hunting is more effective as a team venture. Men who were not very good at relating were Darwinists, leaving men who had a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks, and MacLaughlin did it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry about evolution, but I'm an anthropologist and an occupational disease. Have I told you about the horse in Vaitongi, Samoa, that slipped on the cement and fell in the tub with me? You have to watch the helmets. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine is adorable, really. I only met her in the last few years and wondered why she was in so many movies. I lived in Saratoga, California, where her sister, Olivia DeHavilland, grew up and went to a convent school. Beautiful place. <br /> <br /> If you lose this chronic adventurous adventurer of the British Empahh at its peak, you should never forgive yourself. It is so famous that it is parodied in the film of Peter Sellers, "The Party". Yes, the colonel has to know.
