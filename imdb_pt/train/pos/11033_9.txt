I do not think I'll ever understand hatred for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most incredible action movies of all time. That's right, you little punks, Cliffhanger rules, and we all know that. <br /> <br /> Sly plays Gabe Walker, a former rescue climber who is "just visiting" his old town when he asks for help. a former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), helps in a rescue on a mountain peak. Walker has obviously come back at a convenient time because stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qual. they lost a lot of money they stole from the US government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like to come back ... Basically, Cliffhanger is another clone of Die Hard. Just negotiate the boundaries of Nakatomi Plaza to the open ranges of the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes designed to point out our hero's weaknesses and keep him mortal. Of course, this setup is totally undone soon, as Stallone's character avoids a large number of bullets with ease, and hits head-on rock faces with no apparent side effects. After all, is not that what action movies are about? <br /> <br /> The 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies out there. A show of great scenes and acrobatics. One of the first tricks is one of the best tricks I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than at the beginning, it keeps its action incredible. The main villain of John Lithgow is fun and a bad guy. Quite possibly one of the best villains of all time. <br /> <br /> 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely the best effort of Renny Harlin, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
