I love buying those cheap and bad DVDs from Alpha Video. One day, by chance, I bought this. It's the perfect sci-fi silly 50's movie, all sexed. Filled with nothing scientific, half-naked girls and lots of melodrama, it's a nice movie for those who enjoy this sort of thing. And if you can 'suspend your disbelief' enough, you can really get scared - not just by the psychotic head or the beating of the thing in the closet, but in the end, with the character of 'the perfect body'. Is so . . . . What is another word for mindf *** ing?
