I'm not a big fan of Tim Matheson, but I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie. It was dark and a little disturbing with some rather daring scenes, I do not know if they would rate this movie is a little SF and a little horror I saw it at about 2:00 or so on my local channel there was nothing else then I I decided to watch it. If you have not seen this movie id recommend it is not so bad so the characters are interesting enough but it really did not exploit its full potential which could have made this movie even better. I do not know if this movie went to the movies, but it looks like it was made for TV or went straight to the video, I, for example, would buy this movie. if it's on DVD, it fits well with my kind of movie and has a little bit of the X-FILES story attached to it. Government companies or astute corporations engaged in obscure and dubious business. Overall, a good movie.
