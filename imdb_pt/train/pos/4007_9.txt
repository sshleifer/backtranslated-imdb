A fiercely shocking and intelligent piece of work by talented British writer Hanif Kureishi who wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (this is the best thing he has done ever since). It's about smart people whose lives do not add up too much. They have wasted what they were given and are largely empty vessels. The only character on the screen who is alive is the title's mother, but she feels dead inside until a crude handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex. He has his own motives, but Kureishi treats him with much compassion. This is a movie where people and places feel familiar, where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen. In some ways it's a bit like "Sunday, Bloody Sunday", but it's a much harder job. The director, Roger Michell, allows scenes to be built instinctively. And it is beautifully represented. <br /> <br /> As the homonymous mother Anne Reid betray her wasted life in every gesture. There is not a fake note in his extraordinarily vivid performance, and this great actor Daniel Craig shows nuances to his character, than even Kureishi did not use. If the film gives a false clue, it may be the character of the untalented daughter, involved in a confusing subject with the man her mother seduces (or should be the other way around) and even with the messier life, but she is so well interpreted by Cathryn Bradshaw that she still holds you. The film is also extremely beautiful to see (DoP Alwin Kuchler) and should be classified, without hesitation, as the best British film of the year.
