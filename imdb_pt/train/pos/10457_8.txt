Forget the 'religious' movies that have monopolized the television / movie market ... this movie has a real feel. While it may be considered a movie with cheap emotional draws, it also has this message of forgiveness and good morals in general. However, I did not like the lighting in this movie ... for a movie dealing with that subject, it was very bright. I felt that this took away the general appeal of the film, which is almost an unforgivable sin, but the recognizable cast, and its performances, counteract that lack. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing ... buy the DVD.
