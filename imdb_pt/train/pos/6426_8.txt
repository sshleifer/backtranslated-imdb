One of the best "Amitabh comeback" movies that I liked. This was the stage when Govinda was strong with Dhawan. The songs were amazing and totally like we called "masti". An evergreen artist with the likes of the multifaceted Anupam Kher chipping in. The story line has a lot of hilarious twists as it is known by David Dhawan's potboilers. With a timely appearance by Mrs.Madhuri "Nene" Dixit, it was a total riot at the end. It was great to see Amit performing with such force and humor after a long exile. Although some might consider it a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I would watch it any day. I'm giving an easy 8 out of 10 just because it's pure Bollywood.
