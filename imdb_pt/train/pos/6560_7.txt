I think many viewers have totally missed the fact that this is obviously a parody of Western movies. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie - it's a clever language compared to Westerners. I do not believe this movie was taken seriously for a moment. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie even more unique is the fact that it is centered around 4 strong and beautiful women, two of whom are black, one Asian, and one Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> These are not your usual western women - they are tough - they can draw fast and shoot straight. <br /> <br /> It's so hard that even the bartender is shaking when he spills his whiskey. <br /> <br /> The plot that moves this story is typical of westerns - in the vein of "you shot my brother - then I'll get you!" <br /> <br /> Just in this western, a woman's sister was shot and is out of revenge on the gang that did it. <br /> <br /> So she goes back and forth with her old friends from her days robbing banks. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, is not really so interested in avenging Rachel's sister, but she is motivated by the fact that there are gold and jewels hidden in the city they are going to go to. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that do not make much sense, can be ignored, but I wondered why they were there. So the film could use a bit of a squeeze, but most of all, this is a well made movie that could not find an audience that recognized what it is. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain - of the "heroines", one is obviously straight , the other sexual orientations are never revealed. <br /> <br /> 7 Stars
