I even feel that this movie is a rare treasure. It's not just the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare look at how our society has changed. You have to understand, certain things that we would see as sexual today would be considered innocent at that time. For example, the parents of the children in the film, as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw this as just kids mimicking adults. Most people did not think anyone saw sexually attractive children except teenage boys wishing teenage girls. To them, it was not sexual. Remember that this was before we had internet, TV, etc ... Most sex crimes were not openly brought to the fore. Occasionally, there would be a whisper about the boy with the "funny uncle". But often it was all that happened. Yes very sad. But it's kind of sad today, because I can also see this movie as something different from what was intended, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dance like that and the boys look at her, yes, I was disturbed. I have to remember the time it happened! These children did not know what sex was. The parents knew this, both of the children of the film and of those who watched. The thought may not even have entered their minds. In the eyes of the average adult back then, this was no more sexual than if Shirley were playing house. To this day, the children will participate in the beauty pageant, many of them dressed extremely maturely, for three years. However, the child is just pretending. I do not blame the child for wanting to act like an adult. Or the old movies that exhibit this. In all honesty, our media has made many things seem sick and wrong. This can sometimes be the best. But I really believe that this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare appearance of an innocent mentality, which we have long lost.
