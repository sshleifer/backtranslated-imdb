I would have rated the series as a perfect 10 for excellent, consistently high quality story and character development, if not for the last episode of Season 10! <br /> <br /> The final episode of the 10th season "Unending", where (it would certainly seem), the Asgard was killed in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious way, left me in disbelief! From the extremely harsh ending of the series, it is obvious that many of the story's arcs were scheduled to occur in at least one more season. My guess is they quickly accelerated these stories to position the SG-1 Stargate franchise for the next two direct DVD releases! <br /> <br /> Unless Asgard returns in a future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" extinction), I think the fans have been fooled by a poor cleanup of loose ends! <br /> <br /> Poor end of a brilliant science fiction series.
