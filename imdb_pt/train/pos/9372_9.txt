Red Rock West is one of those rare movies that makes you guess all the time about what will happen next. Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a hired assassin when he enters a small town trying to find work. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and nobody plays better. Look for a brief appearance by country singer Dwight Yoakam. This is a serious drama most of the time, but there are some lighter moments. What matters is that you will enjoy this low budget, but of a high quality effort!
