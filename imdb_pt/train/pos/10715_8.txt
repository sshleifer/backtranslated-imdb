Teresa Pavlinek was a popular cast member of Toronto Second City. She has made numerous ads and commercials here in Canada. Finally, someone has the good sense to create a program for her. The support case looks pretty good too. I've watched the pilot several times and still find it refreshing. However, I do not know why the show is listed as Jane Show 2004. (I may be wrong) But as far as I know, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on TV Global in Canada in early 2006. It's a new idea and hope it does well. Too bad that this could not be combined with Corner Gas. Now I know the gas singing is on the CTV, but the two shows would be great companions.
