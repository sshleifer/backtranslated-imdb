I'm only 11 years old, but I discovered Full House when I was five years old and I watched it constantly until I was seven. So I grew up and I figured Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. Besides, there was also the fact that my younger brother, who faithfully attended me for these two years, began to disgust him thinking that he was also "female." <br /> <br /> So I realized every afternoon at five, it was on the 23rd and once again I became addicted to it. Full House made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how good it would be if our world were like the world of Full House plus a mother. I've heard people say that Full House is tacky and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and hurt their feelings. The three men who live with the girls can get into fights at times. What is more real than that? <br /> <br /> If anything the show got me up when I was down and got me even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I hummed like a hyena at the show and got a huge obsession for Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff has already taken this place, but they were literally the cutest babies I've ever seen. They're great actresses and they seem to be really nice people.)
