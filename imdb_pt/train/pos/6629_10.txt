The best treasure island ever made. They just do not make movies anymore like this or never. No one makes movies like that. More than a novelty, this film is funny, frank and fascinating, but moody, mysterious and somber. This is one of my favorite photos. The director must have had some idea of ​​what it is, but he certainly leaves room for his own impressions and interpretations, leaving little to the imagination. Why he did not make movies like that, I have no idea. While <br /> <br /> I remember some of the best noir, it's one of a kind. But this is not for the lazy or the simple.
