It's amazing that so many people I know have not seen this little gem. Everyone I called came back with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT MOVIE !! <br /> <br /> I've never really cared about Brad Pitt (though his shifts in 12 monkeys and Fight Club have shown improvements but his performance in this movie as a psychopath is unnerving, obscure and accurate. excellent performances and the slow and deliberate pace of the movie greatly increases the process. The fearful feeling for the characters continues to increase as they realize what is really going on. <br /> <br /> The only thing that holds it in a 10 in my book, is that compared to what came before it, the ending is a bit too long and exaggerated.But that's the only flaw I could find in this cult classic. <br /> <br /> If you check out this movie, try to get the unsorted director cut for the best viewing option. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
