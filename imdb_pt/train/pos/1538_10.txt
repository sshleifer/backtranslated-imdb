This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I live a few miles from the village where the story happened, and I know how things work in that area in Sweden. The movie tells the truth, believe me! He criticizes and honors Dalarna's lifestyle, and the producer wants people who watch the film to be more open and caring more about their friends and close relatives. <br /> <br /> But if you live in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or another country), you'll probably also recognize a lot of this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
