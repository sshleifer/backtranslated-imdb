I saw this movie in the first few seconds TR's voice took me to the trip - well I did not like the big thumbs stuck at first, but the absurd humor and the chubby looks of both pussy actors - I do not know who played the young she - but she was great and so was one !!! - the other two people who left the cinema after half an hour, I was with a friend - and it is always a test to watch a movie that I really like one of my friends - and we two also enjoyed the most - hilarious laughter - sadness about the "normal realist cops." we two fans of T.Robbins books ... I found it well done - I thought, that Robbins would also approve, although I have no idea if he likes the movie or not ... <br /> I would love to see the cropped material - I heard that gus v. sand had to take a lot of scenes because of first-time viewers (or producers ???) well, it's still an art film. very short though ... it's one of my all time favorites - and I'm aware that most people do not support this kind of movie and assume that people who like this movie are what they think ... ... .what a pity. I hope the day will come when there will be a DVD with the full material - hoping to see more crispiano, keanu - hoping to see your baby and all <br /> <br /> if you have the chance to see it, think twice, and enjoy if you made the choice to watch ... m
