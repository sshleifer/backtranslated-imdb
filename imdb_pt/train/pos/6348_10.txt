Jim Carrey is good as usual, and although there are some "Jim Carrey moments," it's definitely not a "Jim Carrey movie." <br /> <br /> It's mainly aimed at kids, and I got to enjoy it as such. It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey movie, so those who expected an odd and exaggerated comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has good times and works well as a movie for children. I can not say I LOVED this movie but, again, I'm not your target audience!
