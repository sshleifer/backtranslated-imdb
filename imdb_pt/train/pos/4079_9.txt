I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called "Laupta: The Flying Island"). I simply loved it and was heartbroken when it was repeated a little later and I missed it. I was charmed by the story and the characters, but mostly by the amazing and beautiful music. It would have been the original English-dubbed version that I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the "Streamline Dub" (the dub was actually by Ghibli and only distributed by Streamline), which unfortunately is not available except as part of a ridiculously expensive box-set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I feel that the release was partially spoiled by Disney. The dubbing is good but the dialogue does not have the same brute energy as the streamline stunt or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek seems too old to play the lead role. They made some useless changes, such as changing the main character's name from "Pazu" to "Patzu," and added some dialogues. But worst of all, they ruined a lot of scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of airships, for example, was originally silent, but it was spoiled thanks to Disney's dumb demand that there be music playing whenever someone is not talking, which I find useless in many Disney films. <br /> <br /> This movie still takes the latest animation movies, and I can not recommend it enough. The plot is simple but captivating, and the film shows a touch that is unfortunately missing in most of the homogenized animations of the modern mass market.
