Prince plays 'The Kid' in this semi-autobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musician who has a less than stellar family life. It's true that the acting leaves a little to be desired (except Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, both perfect), but the film is still great and is among the best of the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack of ANY movie from the last 50 years at least highly quotable lines, and the garbage scene is HILARY !! In addition, Apollonia is simply stunning. In an unrelated, when I saw Prince in concert in 2004, he overturned the stadium. He is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts I have ever experienced. <br /> <br /> My Note: A <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Disc 1) Comments with Director Albert Magnoli, producer Robert Cavallo, and director of photography Donald Thorin; Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" Disc 2) A 12-minute featurette at First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (a half-hour film about the movie that I'll review later on the page);" Riffs, Raffs and Revolution: The Impact and Influence of Purple Rain "10 minutes and 30 minutes of MTV Films premiere (when MTV did not suck ass balls); 5 video clips of Prince (Let's Go Crazy, Take Me With You, When Dove Cry, I'd Die 4 U / Baby, I'm a Star and Purple Rain); 2 Videos by The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird) and a music video for "Sex Shooter" by Apollonia 6 <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Apollonia shows off her beautiful butt boobs
