I can not accept the negative comments from other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they are stuck in the past. I'd like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Wild Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I left the theater feeling happy not to have been influenced by critics of the IMDb. 14 hours later, I'm still trying to find flaws in the plot, but I can not think of anything serious. My advice to everyone is to see it for yourself and make up your own mind. <br /> <br /> There follows a pattern similar to Wild Instinct 1, but the plot is less confusing. It still left me thinking in the end, but in a more satisfactory way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and evil as before and uses her 48 years extremely well; this remains its defining role. David Morrisey was satisfactory, although it was not Michael Douglas. Of the supporting cast, I especially liked David Thewlis as a police detective.
