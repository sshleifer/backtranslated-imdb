Let me say from the beginning that I have Cerebral Palsy and I went to this movie hoping to have to make concessions for the main performance. I left the theater half convinced that they had cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy on paper, even though that was not the case. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I believe that is his name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, bold, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant - in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portraits of life with CP. By no means a complete picture, but good examples of the disabled as human beings. Highly recommended.
