This was the first movie I saw Ashley Judd and the first Victor Nunez movie I ever said, and I'm glad I did it. Her "calm" tone, her relaxed rhythm, her "realistic portrayal of a young woman who is just beginning to live, her beautiful portrayal of the struggles she needs to make to mark her life, the decisions she makes based on real things, she knows - there's nothing wrong with this movie.It's as close to the magic of the movies as I've seen outside the "Star Wars" movies, and considering what these movies are, it means that this movie deserves a note The acting of Judley Judds, Nunez's essay and its "great and simple worthwhile story" make it a great story about maturing and a wonderful film.
