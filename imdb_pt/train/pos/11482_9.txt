This film is essentially filmed in a handheld camera by the actors in it. In a way a mockumentary in other ways a video diary of murderers is full because of a "Columbine" style attack. Although this film does not answer all the big questions, it provides an insight into how easy it would be to get away. Through the film you are shown how the actors illegally opened firearms, made bombs and launched a "Zero Day" action plan. The actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, they obviously borrow heavily from their own lives, but at no point did I really detect them acting (something Tom Cruise should try). The use of the CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was great, but I'm not sure if we needed the last scene. Overall, despite a very good movie on a very difficult subject.
