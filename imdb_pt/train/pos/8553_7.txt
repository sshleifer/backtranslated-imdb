I just watched the movie I was scared to be disappointed. I was quite surprised by the ending though. The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all time. Yes, that will not be true if I say that I enjoyed myself as much as I liked the originals. The beta house along with the two previous pies definitely missed something the first two pies had. It will not become a classic, since the first two have already been. but hell, it's still funny with many good times and I think it should be the first movie to be chosen if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or at school. beta house deserves 6/10, but I gave 7/10 just for being another slice of PIE.
