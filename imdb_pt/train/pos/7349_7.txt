Of course if you are reading my review you have seen this movie. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24 * 7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies and imitate characters, etc. I love the scene where a rock breaks in Kader Khan's mouth while I'm eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor tells a trivial story about the affairs of Raja Babu at a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. This is my favorite scene from the movie. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just chemistry between two great Indian actors making a comical scene without dialogue. It's brilliant. It's a cat mouse movie. Just watch these actors helping each other and still taking the scene from each other. Its total entertainment. If you like chemistry Govinda and Kader Khan, then it is a must. I think RB is the sixth on my list of David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1 'precedes this gem of a movie. 7/10
