This low budget digital video movie has strengths in the right places - writing and acting. In addition, digital photography is the best of the lot so far. In low light conditions, the characteristic umber tone prevails, but, surprisingly, it rivals the film's brightness, clarity and saturation in high light conditions. This is the best way to make street movies with a grumpy dialogue that brings a kind of "Midnight Cowboy" story about people doing whatever it takes to survive in the urban San Francisco area.
