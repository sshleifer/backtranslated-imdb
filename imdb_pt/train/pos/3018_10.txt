This film is an exception to the rule that a sequel is worse than the original. Your comedy at its best. This movie is a fast-paced comedy where something seems to happen every second. On more than one occasion the whole audience laughed out loud at a joke. <br /> <br /> It is a great advantage to have seen the first film, but it is not a requirement. GÃ¶ta kanal 2 also has the advantage of being a parody in the last few decades reality TV production series as survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish) This is a Swedish movie for the Swedish public. So do not see if you're unfamiliar with Sweden and your language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
