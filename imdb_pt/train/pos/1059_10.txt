I love this show, it sure will be a winner. Jessica Alba does a great job, it's time we had an eccentric girl who is not the cute guy. The whole cast is wonderful and every episode has a good plot. Everything is well placed and thought. To put it together should have taken a while because it was not someone in a hurry who just knocked something together. It's a great show altogether.
