I just saw this movie version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before. She was pleasantly surprised by the sung voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought that the sequences of Havana, where Simmons and Brando dance a storm, were excellent. Those were quite impressive for me as well and generally were the highlights of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film that originated as a Damon Runyon story takes time with the slow rhythm of non-musical scenes at first, but it pulls you after a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so compelling to me, but it still had its charms, especially during the "Sue Me" number. He also loved Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Shaking the Boat" number and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical appearance throughout, Guys and Dolls is not a great musical movie, but it sure is very good.
