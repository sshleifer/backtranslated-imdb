What can be said about Mr. Moore? He is the godfather of rap, he is the king of the blaxploitation films of level Z, and here he is back as his most famous character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This film is a roller coaster of politically incorrect humor, kung fu, nudity, cheese, violence and many other things you would never find in most modern movies (or in movies, actually, haha!) The stand- up that he gives early on is not to be missed! Anyway, D2 is definitely a fun way to waste an hour or more. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and he has no class! I'm going to swing that shotgun at his ****!"
