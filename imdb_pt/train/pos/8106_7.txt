This film is difficult to watch in our accelerated 21st century culture, but it pays off for the messages it conveys, especially the consequences and ramifications of technology on society, specifically when this technology is used for war. This film presents a complete cycle of dehumanization and re-humanization, influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization, and thus serves as a warning against the misuse of technology, but as the circle is complete, familiar themes and feelings arise again to present selfish, rather than self-destructive, forms that mankind can use. <br /> <br /> Bright for your time, the quality of the image and sound can pose a challenge to some, but as a milestone in the history, development and evolution of the sci-fi genre, it is a must. In the end, free will and free choice are once again placed upon humanity as a means of controlling our own destiny rather than having it served by another person or, indeed, the state of society itself, such as those shaped by world events. <br /> <br /> Those who are oppressed by what life does sometimes tend to remain so, but still there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains, as this movie postulates. To the extent that it qualifies as sci-fi, one of the greatest common demonizers of this genre is its speculative nature. It asks the questions, and if these events happened in that way, and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it? How would we react? With regard to influence, this film projects the speculative sciences that make science fiction as unique as it is and makes us ask these important questions.
