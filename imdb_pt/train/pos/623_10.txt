There are not many movies around that gave me a feel like Stardust did throughout the course of the movie. Magically like a fairy tale like The Princess Bride, Stardust is definitely the most wonderful fantasy show of the 2000s and 90s. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful images as well as unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, myself challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the movie, you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destiny that captivates the viewer from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, not a decimal less.
