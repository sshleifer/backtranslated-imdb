This was an excellent episode, one of the best of both seasons. Below is the right horror for a change, with a story that is well above the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. A man's wife is nearly burned to death in a tragic car accident, in which he was driving. Her airbag worked, she did not. She is burned beyond recognition (great makeup) and does not have much chance to live without a complete skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she keeps dying, but brought back by modern technology, and when she dies for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vindictive spirit. The carnage, of course, follows, and also some extremely bloody killings, and also, some extremely sensual scenes. What more could you ask for, you might ask? Well, not much, because this baby has it all, and a very satirical ending, which should leave a smile on most of the faces of the viewers. I also loved the direction of Rob Schmidt (Wrong Turn) too, he has a great talent for terror. Excellent episode, this is one I'm buying for sure.
