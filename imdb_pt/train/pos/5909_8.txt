I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a normal cartoon movie ... except when the bras and bullets began to fly. I have to agree that this movie will leave anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone ... but the truth is that it's funny how the hell as it is deep. I recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics. Also try Fritz, the cat, and the Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki made that movie too. It involves a cat that goes through difficult times with family, streets, jobs, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all those movies. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during that time, it was also labeled as Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also made Cool World starring a young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.
