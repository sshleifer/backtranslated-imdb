I'm writing this after seeing The Perfect Son at the 2002 Carnival Gay and Lesbian Festival in Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When their father dies, two brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that the brothers are dying of AIDS, they go on a journey of reconciliation of the heart. The two leaders do a magnificent job of creating the warmth and gradual respect that accumulates between them as the film progresses. I have a doubt about the movie - while the dying brother acts badly, he does not seem to. A person with T4 cells would become quite sick - not even a makeup job to make the actor look sick was employed. A minor complaint, but that makes it a little less realistic. Despite this little complaint, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and you should get a chance to see it. I'm hoping for a DVD release in the near future!
