Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed 'The Baron' with it, a fantasy series about three superhuman spies who anticipated 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. It was one of my favorites when I was younger and I like to watch it still. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had unmistakable on-screen chemistry like Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while lusty Alexandra Bastedo played her role as Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderfully rude Tremayne. By far the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own "The Interrogation" compared favorably with "The Prisoner." I regret that there never was a second series; the concept had a lot of life in it. Had Craig and Richard been competing for Sharron's affection? What if Tremayne had learned about the powers of the champions? Have the champions had any other skills than we've seen? We never found out, unfortunately.
