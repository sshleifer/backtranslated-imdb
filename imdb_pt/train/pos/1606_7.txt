The "adult-oriented film" is a rare thing these days, but Moonstruck does it well, and it's still a better-than-average movie, which is aging very well. Although the comedic moments are more objective than the rest, the film has a wonderful specificity (the Italians in Brooklyn) that is not used to deceive the characters or the spectators. (that is, mafiosos never appear in complication. It never becomes grotesque like my big fat Greek wedding). The secondary lines of the story are told economically with short scenes that allow a break with the main wire. These are the scenes that are lacking in contemporary films, where their immediate value can not be impressed by producers and bigwigs. I miss those scenes. It also beautifully involves older characters. The film takes its own light and tranquil path to a conclusion. There is not a badly written scene anywhere to get some executives to relax. Cage and Cher do a very good job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck invokes New York School, ethnic, workaday very much like 'Marty', except Moonstruck is much less hypocritical.
