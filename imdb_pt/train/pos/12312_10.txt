I can not believe a movie that can be so good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the West. Will not repeat other reviews on here. The score is very good and moving. It literally means "Dawn please never comes" - when you arrive, the beautiful ghost and lover will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie are still great. I liked Joel in God of Gamblers and many Leslie movies including Better Tomorrow.
