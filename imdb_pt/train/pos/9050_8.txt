This is a gem, a true piece of Americana for all that this entails. If you are self-programmed to resist stories that affirm life, just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe. And what makes the cake cover really delicious is that it is based on real facts, there is no need to choose which details have been changed to create a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self-conflicting, successful at the core of the father he portrayed could only be successfully achieved by someone with his skill and insight. Stupid remarks, refusing to accept a parent who tries to establish the law all the time feeling he may be off the rail, expose the commentator's limitation, not the writers or acting. This is not for the cynical, or the simple minded.
