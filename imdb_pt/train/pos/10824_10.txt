"Still Crazy" is arguably the biggest rock comedy of all time. It was mistakenly compared to "This Is Spinal Tap" which is unrelated to. "Spinal Tap" is a satire (and, frankly, it's not very good, although it's "coming out" of many rock cliches). Unlike "Tap", "Still Crazy" is filled by great actors, great songs and great human situations. You care about people in "Still Crazy". That's all that matters. Ah, yes, the song is very good too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The American public was already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but only later became acquainted with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter films).
