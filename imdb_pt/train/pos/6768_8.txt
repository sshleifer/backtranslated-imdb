One of my favorite shows in the '80s. After the first season, it started coming down when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott to the cast. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was fun to see her and the character of Ernest Borgnine go together. The last episode in which she appeared was one of my favorites in Season Two. Unfortunately, during those days, blacks did not last long on television shows. Some of the episodes of the second season where okay, but the third season was more about the human characters than Airwolf and was not shown until almost at the end of the show. When I went to the US, it was disgusting !!!
