I fell in love with this drama of silent action. Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have interpreted this so well. Created since childhood to know nothing but war and fights, Todd (Kurt Russell) is played on a planet after being left obsolete by genetically modified soldiers. <br /> <br /> The stage is set and another classic icon from the action movies was born - SOLDIER. Neither Rambo, nor Schwarzenegger, nor Bruce Willis, nor Mel Gibson, nor Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and made it entirely his - original, daring and too human. I miss the fact that sequels were never made. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5 / jbc33 /
