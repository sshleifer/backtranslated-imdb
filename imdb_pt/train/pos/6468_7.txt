This is a very good movie ... yes, some parts are thighs and exceptionally convenient, and the film does not justify the big cast of stars (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actor who really impressed me here was Kay Kay Menon (not to be confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he first meets Amitabh's character, I thought that a man who can just look at AB, keep looking and do not say a word, and still look strong, is definitely a good actor. In fact, he proved to be worthy again in Sarkar, along with AB for the second time. This guy should have more roles, he's brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you've read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot, and I agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry into Pakistan was a bit too easy. And the little angle of love he shared with "what's her face" was completely unnecessary. But he is a good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is cool to watch, always. and AB ... what can I say. I do not know if I'm your biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for the place. An interesting watch, considering it's Bollywood, although somewhat inspired by Hollywood oldies like "the Great Escape" and "Bridge on the River Kwai".
