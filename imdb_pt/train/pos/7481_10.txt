I could not agree more with the quote "this is one of the best movies ever made". If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a "re-make", you could not be more wrong. There is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is smooth and delicate at times (old scenes with Sofia) and other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds fit perfectly into this movie. Without the song, the story is only half-told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional but eclectic score for the film, which could not be better suited to a dream-like theme (although it was never released, I managed to get my hands on the original score for about $ 60. you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etc., are also perfect for the film. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, the emotional themes of this film (ie love, sadness, repentance) are very powerful and are amplified tenfold by visual and musical experience as well as ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes over and over again. The best part of this movie however (as if it could get better) is that it is so cleverly crafted in such a way that every time you watch the movie, you will get something new - so watch closely and Be prepared to think! Of course, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second clock, but there is always more in the story than you think. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best work of Cameron Crowe and, in all, a work of brilliance. Much of my cinematic production and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. Honestly, it touched my life, as true art has a tendency to do. It continually surprises me that there are many people who can not appreciate this movie for what it is (I think to understand true art is an art in itself). <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Vanilla Sky is in an alloy of his films. own.
