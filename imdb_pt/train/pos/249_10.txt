I've seen the trailer for this movie several times, and I have to say that Ned Kelly looks like it's going to be a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not take my eyes off it (this caught my eye for sure). Heath Ledger adheres to what he knows and to what works for him, period pieces. Not to mention Orlando Bloom which is seen for a split second looks fantastic. I think this movie will be a hit, and will be seen repeatedly by my many people.
