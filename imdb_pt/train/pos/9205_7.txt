It grew in me. I love R.D. Burman's music and despite the raw elements in the story I found it very moving as I continued to watch the movie again. The sister-brother plot is powerful, I thought; there are also probably more obligatory things, like bar fights, a crazy crime story, etc. which are just distractions. (Although it is not bland from a certain point of view.) Also the translation into English is definitely from someone for whom it was a bit exaggerated, and, as crazy as it may be, I am grateful to him for doing so. Like many of the Bollywood movies I have seen, this is melodramatic and opera, including here a song first sung by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister, and then the same song sung. more or less years later, by the man who traveled to Kathmandu seeking to reconnect with this girl, grown and disturbed (she had said that her brother and her mother were dead), numbing her pain with drugs. One super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement that has brought hordes of seekers to India from the Indian point of view who sees them as people taken to India by an awakened spiritual hunger by the failures of their own societies, but even so, in India, they live only for the pleasures of the moment. The hippie singing and drugging scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone (I'm old enough to remember), and I'm sure the masses of young zoned whites are real hippies extra, as I remember hearing about children in the caravan for the East receiving this kind of work in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (It's not about the Hare Krishna movement, although the hippies in the film sing a Krishna / Rama chant, as well as a group of real Indian devotees, unrelated to the hippies, in the opening scene of the movie .) <br /> <br /> Virginia
