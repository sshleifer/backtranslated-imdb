A chance encounter between a salesman and a successful man changes their lives. This is a weird movie that works, an impressive effort for screenwriter and director Shepard. In a boldly unglamorous role that is a long way from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the solitary man of success who begins to give in to the stress of his work but is unable to connect emotionally with someone to help him cope. Kinnear is equally good as the seller, a decent guy with a void in his life. Davis is very much like Kinnear's flirting wife. Mainly a character study, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy.
