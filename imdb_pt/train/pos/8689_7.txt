Perfect cast for a few people's drama. Simon is dead, but somehow resurrected from the outside. What he saw there is displayed in the form of white spaces orchestrated to a magnificent track by the German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon is haunted by his death, comforted by the support of death that people he had seen on the other side. His girlfriend tries to hold him for life, but no, decides to follow him after his death. Very sensitive and touching, deeply psychological, but a bit slow and somehow boring.
