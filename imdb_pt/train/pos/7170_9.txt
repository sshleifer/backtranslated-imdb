HOLES is not a normal Disney thing - it's very, very fun, even for adults who generally shrink from the "family entertainment" designed by the focus group that Uncle Walt's studio goes live. Perhaps the secret to the success of this film lies in its fidelity to the original book, which is a little darker than the average childish thing. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys camp, where all inmates are forced to dig holes in the desert sun as a form of rehab. But as the story progresses, Stanley's tale intertwines with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about a prison camp that only boys have the right to be. Jon Voight is especially nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is gorgeous, as always.
