This is one of the few films in which I consider the delivery of the film an improvement of the original book. The story is clear, accessible, entertaining and interesting and the musical numbers are undoubtedly exceptional. I loved the cyclical version of 'The Old Home Guard' and the charming 'Portobello Road', a great combination of precocious animation techniques + real actors who, while dated, do not detract from the charm of the play. The background of World War II worked well and was not omitted as the film unfolded, which so often happens in stories of "evacuees." <br /> <br /> A film often very underestimated, does not produce any end to the film. pleasure for people of all ages. The performances of the actors are exceptionally well done and the whole text is well tied up and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
