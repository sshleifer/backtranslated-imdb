Well, that was one of those movies I knew, and it was good enough for me to record it when it came next time ... If, like me, you like a lot of horror movies from the '80s that branched out a bit not just another glut of generic sequels), so I think you can appreciate it. When the thug ends up appearing in person, he definitely was not what I expected to see! All in all, I would not go out of your way for this, but if you like the genre, then watch out if it shows up and you have an hour and a half to kill I guess. I would give 6.5 out of 10.
