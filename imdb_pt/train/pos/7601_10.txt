Lost is unique ... it is so charming and full of suspense, emotion and emotion at the same time. I've never seen any TV shows like this before. It is full of emotions in the jungle and has a good script. The actors have thrilled life on an island in such a natural way that I feel lost on the island while watching. It's a great job narrated in a very clever way. The series is like a movie portraying the life of the island. survivors lost on a deserted island. I am tempted to watch one episode after another and I highly recommend this series to all lovers of the TV show. Pay attention to see the magic of being lost nowhere.
