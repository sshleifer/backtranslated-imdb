This series was a cut above the rest of the day's TV detective series, but somehow did not find an audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be entirely new, but it added a lot to the story. And who could forget Pax, the beautiful guide dog of the series! <br /> <br /> Although the stories themselves have not been better than the average series, the sets in New Orleans, acting and music (I note the comment about the score in other reviews ... I remember of course) all the work to make a good TV series even better! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... one day Paramount can just enjoy your files and release it on DVD!
