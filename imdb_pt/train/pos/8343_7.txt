The Australian Fred Schepisi (A Cry in the Dark) directs this comedy / romance that is fun, relaxing and set in the spring. You'll laugh while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is a car mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, who gets taller with the help of Albert Einstein, Walter Matthau (Grumpy Old Men) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them by the foreskin shoes. Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle, You Got Mail) is Catherine Boyd, Einstein's niece, who is a competent but not so confident mathematician. Maybe it's because she's surrounded by all this genius. She thinks that if she marries someone with a high I.Q. your children will have a high I.Q. too, but she does not know what she wants. Between Tim Robbins' cute smile and Meg's cuteness, this is a refreshing movie. I love sweet stories. People of all ages should like this movie. Catherine is engaged to the idiot James Moreland, who works with animal behavior, but is very muffled. This is a situation of love at first sight, between the mechanic and the mathematician. Spirals and subliminal lines! Cinematography is cool. Princeton, New Jersey is beautiful in the spring. With much help from all those bright men, Catherine falls in love with Ed, unaware that he is an auto mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite Scenes: Ed doing a multiple choice test in front of a crowd with the help of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein riding a motorcycle. Nathan, Kurt and Boris leaving all the search animals free! <br /> <br /> Favorite quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not let your brain interfere with your heart." Ed Walters: "When was the last time he said" Wahoo "? Catherine Boyd: "Well, I'm sure I do not know." This is a refreshing movie I recommend. I have the tape and every once in a while I watch it again.
