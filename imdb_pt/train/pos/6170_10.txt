I saw this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year and I was impressed by it. It is a rich and hot novel brought to the screen, beautifully rendered and well directed. More than anything else, it reminded me of David Lean's films, both in his ability to deal with a complex story and in his way of creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels. The best movie I've seen in years.
