This is one of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may look dated, but that does not distract the film. One should try to observe, criticize and enjoy any form of art from the perspective of time. Clearly by "Sex in the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was terribly annoying. However, when judged from the perspective of 1925 in America, he was fantastic. Likewise Sayonara is an innovative film in his look at a case of mestizo love, arrogance and American prejudice "manifest destiny" and the complexity of different cultures. It's a natural next step for movies like the Gentleman Settlement. Its purpose, however, was not just a social comment, but rather fun and enjoyable, with countless lines that simply do not forget. <br /> <br /> However, even when taken just as a love story, it's great. Although some attack Brando's accent, he is at his best in nuances and characterizations. Button and Umeki (who both won the Oscar) and the rest of the supporting cast add a lot to the film. <br /> <br /> Taka, the real star, does a fabulous job making you feel the passion she has for Brando while being ripped off by her sense of obligation and loyalty. Her speech when she first meets and talks to Brando is a classic and something rarely if ever combined in the movies. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in his dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the film is equally good. Of course, it does not have the suck of the mouth, the exchange of spit and worse, that exemplifies the love in the movies of today, but that makes everything better. It portrays true love and passion, not just "warmth." If this movie does not touch you, you are too young, cynical or dead.
