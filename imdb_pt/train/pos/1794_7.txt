In the middle of "Night" of Lajos Koltai, a woman on her deathbed makes a figure appear in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life went?" The line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman who speaks is Vanessa Redgrave, delivering it with complete simplicity, and the question tears her heart. <br /> <br /> From time to time, the film based on the skirts of Susan Minot's novel. sentimentality and ordinariness, arrests attention, offers admirable performances and generates emotional involvement as few recent films have. With just six months of last year, there are now two memorable, significant and valuable films in theaters, and the other, of course, is Sara Polley's "Away from Her." Hollywood may have turned "Evening" into a celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life moms and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave in the film (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays the younger self of Streep, while the young incarnation of Redgrave is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson and a great cast - yes, it could have turned into a multi-star platform. Instead, Koltai - the brilliant director of Hungarian photography for "Mephisto" and director of "Fateless" - created a subtle joint work with a "continental feeling," the story taking place in a high-society Newport environment, on days when preceded a marriage full of problems. <br /> <br /> Lost connections, wrong choices and obedience obedient to social and family press present a novel, but the quality of writing, Koltai's direction, and disinterested acting increase "Night" well above that level in the air rarefied of the English, French (and some American) family sagas of a century before its contemporary scene. <br /> <br /> Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle, encounter clarity, understanding and captivation. The individual melodies are intertwined in a symphony. <br /> <br /> And yet, with all the previous emphasis on ensemble and altruistic performances, the stars of "Evening" still shine, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (a new and exciting discovery, looking vaguely like his mother, but a very different actress), Danes carrying most of the charge - until Streep appears in the final moments and of course steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are well worth the price of admission too. <br /> <br /> As with "Away From It", "Night" stays with you, inviting you to rethink the story and the characters, and experiencing the emotions it raises. At two o'clock the movie runs a little, but the way he stays with you after that is welcome among the many movies that cool long before his popcorn.
