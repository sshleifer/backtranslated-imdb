I recently bought the much underrated Dreamcast and went to town to find some games to use them. I bought Soul Calibur (A Classic) and then I went through the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2, and I have played Res Evil 3 numerous times, and I was impressed with all of them, especially no.1 that has to go down in history has a classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them came close to the Dreamcast attempt of Brilliant Gory Gameplay. If it's just to buy a dreamcast for this game, it's worth every moment of your time and effort, I've never been so enthralled with a computer game the way it captivated me. <br /> <br /> In any case, the story continues from the second story in which Claire Redfield looks for her brother (Chris - from the 1st story), who is presumed to be under the conspiracy of the dreaded guard company, rain. Little is known about this corporation except the fact that you destroyed them 3 times on the previous floors. <br /> <br /> So by helping Claire, with the super brat Steve's assistant, you must reveal the truth about the real. your brother's location. The second CD lets you control Chris, this if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear. <br /> <br /> The control is very smooth and the movement of the characters is magnificently realistic, when the character realizes the danger, he faces the direction from which he comes. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> Generally I gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year, game of the decade and the best game in the world. !! Please buy this game as soon as possible.
