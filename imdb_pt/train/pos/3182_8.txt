Handsome and dashing British rider George Taylor (a solid portrait of Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten by thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong (a charming and enchanting performance of the lovely Chai Lee). George returns to health and returns to work. When Emy can not hear from George for a long period of time, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. Although director / co-writer Bitto Albertini actually provides a satisfying amount of the expected hot nudity and steamy sex, this movie is anything but his routine wallow. Instead, it's a surprisingly thoughtful, touching and tragic love story between two well-designed and highly engaging characters (Chai as Emy Wong is especially radiant and captivating). The image begins bubbly and cheerful, but the tone changes radically to a more severe and rough climate about two-thirds of the way. Emy's fall into addiction after she falsely supposes that George has abandoned her is distressing and disturbing; Ditto the sad surprise and painful nasty final surprise. Granted, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too silly or worthless. In addition, the sex scenes are quite delicious and even genuinely erotic. The notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a good share of support as George's enviable and uninhibited secretary, Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's polished cinematography offers many incredibly beautiful photos of exotic locations. The vibrant and vibrant score of Nico Fidenco hits the spot. It is worth looking for those looking for something different.
