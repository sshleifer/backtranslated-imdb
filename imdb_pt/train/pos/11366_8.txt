A superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Magnificent performance of Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, particularly the former Communist party members who want to keep a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film has an underlying theme about the decline of communist society, and progress in killer hunting is reflected by the progress in social and political change in Russia, which is subtly placed. There is a conflict of old ways and new forms, and these are represented by the two views of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rea himself. These are polarized initially, with Sutherland 'high' on the system looking down, and Rea 'down' on the ground, looking up. However, do they have a common cause? to catch the serial killer. Throughout the film, the relationship between these two develops, and tension gradually diminishes until at the end of the film Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught and Glasnost comes symbolically. Excellent script. Other credits go to the performance of Sutherland, who is superb and friendly, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer we despise but we can not hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is completely convincing as the humble. psychologist who risked his reputation to help.
