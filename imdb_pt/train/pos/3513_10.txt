Actor Herman Jos√© plays the footballer of a football manager who acquires the pass of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of Benfica (heart club), FC Porto, so these players did not play well, and he wanted FC Porto to suffer. But what happens is that these two players, after all, are good and FC Porto sells them for a lot of money to a foreign club, doing a good deal. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without great antecedents in great films, is a comedy very good and amusing, showing all the rivalry that exists between North / South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
