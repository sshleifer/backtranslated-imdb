Dan Katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller coaster through a real novel set in the troubles around modern Israel. <br /> <br /> For those who have been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, insecurities and hurts that make love so bitter. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that accompanies the difficult times in Israel at that time only serves to intensify the feeling. Instantly, you are drawn to Dan's situation, and you can not help but be deeply moved. <br /> <br /> You can not write drama and passion like this - the contrast between Dan's realities is desperate, rapturous relationship with Iris, and the realities of a turbulent state make it eminently watchable. If you have a crush of passion and have already been in love, watch this movie.
