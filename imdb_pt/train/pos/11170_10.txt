There is something about Pet Sematary that I have never felt anywhere else. Perhaps the fact that I was a child, when I first saw it, made this experience so memorable. But as I continue to watch him over and over, I never get old and never get bored. From the opening credits with that spooky opening song to the very chaotic ending, there's something insane, sad and scary at the same time, and it keeps ringing in your head: sometimes it's better to die! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be useful to report the whole story again. All you need to know is that it starts at point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step by step drowns at point B (which is, believe, the end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and Pet Sematary is the last place on earth that I would be. Like I said, sometimes dead is better!
