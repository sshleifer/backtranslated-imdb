One of my favorite movies was when I was 10, which probably says a lot about the kind of humor. Although dated the mood definitely has a charm about it. Expect to see Askey & Murdoch's usual joke so popular in his day, with many interesting and quirky co-characters. The lady with the parrot, the couple who should get married and is in trouble with 'her', and my favorite, the station's boss, "Nobody knows where it comes from ... no one knows where it's going ..." Curiously, ghost train was written by Arnold Ridley, of the fame of Dads Army (Private Godfrey, the doctor). Watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon after lunch and smile.
