If "Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" is the father of all horror films (and German expressionist film), this prewar movie is Grandfather. The starving student, dying of hunger in an empty attic, makes a deal with the devil - the devil gives him a bag with no gold bottom, in exchange for "anything in this room." The devil chooses the reflection of the student in his mirror. He walks with the student's doppelganger, who commits crimes for which the student is guilty. <br /> <br /> The film is marked by some limitations arising from the technically primitive state of cinema of 1913; the plot calls for chiaroscuro effects, but the film is necessarily practically all filmed in daylight without shadows. But the scene where the reflection comes out of the mirror still packs a punch. <br /> <br /> More interesting for stronger trends than for your own good, The Student of Prague is still worth it.
