I recently came across this movie on TNT five minutes later while on holiday in Florida ... (hey, there's got to be some time at the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any long TNT movie. I mean "Drive Me Crazy", it's not that old, is it? <br /> <br /> But I stayed with him, and I was completely surprised and entertained. Melissa plays her role as the psychotic Jennifer in an excellent way. The support cast (Nick, the ex-spouse, Karen, her best friend, and her parents who control life) added a great deal of credibility. The turnaround at the end was a good ending to the story of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
