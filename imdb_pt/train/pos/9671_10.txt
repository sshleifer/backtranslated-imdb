Paulie is a minor girl's fantasy or maybe her memory of what her youth was like growing up. Tony Shaloub performs flawlessly as a Russian scientist (PhD) who can not find decent work in America. He befriends an isolated parrot while performing petty duties of a janitor in a behavioral science laboratory. <br /> <br /> The chief physician is a bitter man, like Paulie, who can speak and understand language completely and learn, embarrasses the doctor. , who then expels him to the lower levels of the building, where Mikail (Tony S.) finds him. <br /> <br /> Paulie portrays her life with Marie and how they got lost. The quest begins to gather Paulie with Marie, only over 20 years have passed. <br /> <br /> The movie ends, some will say predictably, with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie. The story ends with the three entering Marie's house, where you can make the final choice. <br /> <br /> Great family movie!
