I can agree with other comments that there was not a huge amount of story discussed in the movie, but it was not a documentary! It was meant to entertain and I think it did a very good job at it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. Like all of a sudden, it would be released, but I picked up the story and the connection between the families later and found it very good. <br /> <br /> Although it was not a re-enactment of the 60's brought to light very large and important landmark periods of the decade. I found it very entertaining and worth watching.
