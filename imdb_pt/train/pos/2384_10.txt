It is a well-known fact that when Gene Roddenberry first launched Star Trek for NBC, the original pilot episode, The Cage, was rejected as being "too cerebral." When the series had another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to establish the events of the rejected episode as canon, and did so by writing The Menagerie, which has the unique distinction of being the sequence of what it still was at the time. , an unparalleled episode. This time, instead of exploring a new planet, Kirk and his team are at Starbase 11, paying a visit to former Enterprise Commander Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney), now terribly disfigured and paralyzed because of an accident. Pike joins his successor in the spaceship, where an unpleasant surprise awaits: Spock, who used to serve under Pike's command, hijacked the ship and traced the way to Talos IV, a planet that is off limits (punishment is death ) since Pike and Spock's last visit there, 13 years earlier. Of course, being a logical creature, Spock surrenders and organizes a court martial so he can justify his actions. <br /> <br /> There is no need to talk more about the plot since the rest will happen in Part 2. What really strikes is how Roddenberry creates the connection between The Cage and the rest of the Star Trek universe , creating a particular kind of flashback that allows everyone, on screen and off, to see what might have been of the Trek, NBC did not turn down the original design. In particular, it's fun to see Jeffrey Hunter (who could not get back in The Menagerie) to play Pike as a more serious captain than Kirk used to be and the early days of Nimoy as Spock, whose personality was not yet fully established: this is the only one time in the whole series that everyone's favorite vulcano smiles spontaneously. <br /> <br /> In short, not just a great episode of "mystery" but also a treat for those who can not be bothered to track The Cage in its original form (it's available as part of the box set Season 3).
