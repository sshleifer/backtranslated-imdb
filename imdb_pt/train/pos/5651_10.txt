It was a bit bizarre and bad and I really enjoyed it, the characters in the show were great too, and they praised each other well. I regretted seeing it cut ... I would have loved to see where it might have gone. You found yourself leaning toward Lucas, the sheriff, who had more secrets than anyone else. Lucas was scary and attractive. And I wish I had seen more of him and how his character became. I will however buy the show just for fun, it was great for something different on TV. And Paige Turco, who was Caleb's cousin, was a great mystery about where and what it meant to Lucas. It's a shame that it's still not around .. or it was never finished, I would have loved to see what would have happened.
