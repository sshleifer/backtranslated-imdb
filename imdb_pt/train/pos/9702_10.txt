the town of Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The characters would be just wrong and very disturbing, but fantastically brilliant writing means it works, and it works very well. Most people will meet other people with the touch of some characters, but hopefully no one will meet people with extreme personalities like Tubbs and Edward, the local shop owners who hate strangers, or Pauline, obsessed with the pen, who tries to "dole scum ". with much contempt. These were just a few of the strange inhabitants. TV works consist of 3 series and a Christmas special. There are references to many horror films, such as the wicker man. A more recent addition to the range of works is a film, the championship of apocalypse of gentlemen, of which I will not say much, but I recommend it. All in all the gentlemen's league is a hilarious comedy show with brilliant writing and brilliantly crazy characters. I would definitely say it worth watching as you will not regret it!
