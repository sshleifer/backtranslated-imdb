I realize that a lot of people hate this movie, but I must admit it's one of my favorites. It turns out that I like it better than its predecessor and happy to like it better than many movies. <br /> <br /> First, I think people never give credit to history as well as Back to the Future, Time Traveling is hard to write, and in that movie they included Time Travel and a Spiritual Journey. <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were there with the best performances in this movie, they looked cooler, they acted nicer, and said cooler things. <br /> <br /> The setting of this movie is also incredible. The sets are pretty detailed and massive at times, and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie of about two years. teenage buddies who can barely spell ... but he's not the genius of the whole franchise, making these two idiots bigger than the characters in life who are responsible for the whole utopian future of Earth. <br /> <br /> The costumes were also impressive. Bill and Ted actually look cool in Bogus Journey, where, as in Outstanding Adventure, they look a little as well as they say, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this movie is amazing, the score especially. There's so much I could say about this movie because I love it. But this is one of those movies that I grew up watching and every time I liked it more then I can understand why people hate or just think it's Bogus compared to Excellent Adventure (which I also adore on purpose). <br /> <br /> DISCOVER WITH YOUR BAD SELF !!!!
