A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> So, possibly, it is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Camera work, acting, direction and everything else is unique, original, superb in every way - and very different from the rubbish we're sadly accustomed to having. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, believable and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this film, her acting is unique - it's completely her - neither "British" nor "American" nor anything else I've ever seen. There's something mesmerizing about it. <br /> <br /> The long and uninterrupted filming is wonderful, remembering that we get too used to some restricted ways of filming and editing.
