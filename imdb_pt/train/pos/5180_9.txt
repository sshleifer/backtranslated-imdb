There is this private campground in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has existed since 1959. My grandparents were among their founders, my parents had a website from 1965, and my two brothers have locations there now. <br /> <br /> (It has nothing to do with the film directly, have patience with me.) <br /> <br /> I spent the summers on Blueberry Hill from when I was five years old until when I was eighteen, and it is for people like me who this movie speaks of: those for whom a group camp in the woods was, as my fiancee tells, "the good and happy place." If you've never experienced the lifestyle, the Indian summer will probably be lost on you; Do not bother yourself. It is not fast, it does not have fast cuts, the plot is not complicated at all, it has no explosions, a tension as dramatic as there is light, there are no actors on the first list, there are no quick jokes just to show how the writers are clever (aside from Kimberley Williams' killer line about how her fianc√© should not "destabilize." "It's not the least the movie is about, more than The Godfather is a slasher movie just because there's so much in it. <br /> <br /> But Indian summer is the polar opposite of the godfather. <br /> <br /> If you have ever experienced the lifestyle, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Read more, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me , this is a 9/10 movie.
