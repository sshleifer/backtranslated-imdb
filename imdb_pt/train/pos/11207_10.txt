This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it is easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it's a pretty impressive job. Why it is not printed is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and animation together. This used to run as part of the "Disney Vault" every few months but I have not seen it for some time. * sigh * More recommended.
