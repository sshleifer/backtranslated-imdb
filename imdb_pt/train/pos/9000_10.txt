I first saw SAMURAI BLOOD in its premiere at the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! Blood just blew us away with its pure verve, blood, vitality, blood, excitement, blood, absolute campiness, and even more bloody, and all in SO GREAT FUN! Especially for those of you who enjoy all those Japanese samurai and chambara ninja movies, YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO SEE BLOOD!
