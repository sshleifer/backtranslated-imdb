What can I say, I grew up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Soraj creates something hard to find. Love and family together that loving and great. Vivah is a journey for a couple that is managing to arrange a marriage that revolves around arranging and loving the marriage. Shahid did a great job. Anupamji as always brilliant. Amrita Rao came out different even though I felt that somehow the other to me she did not fit that role. We saw her in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras, and Main ho on Na. So stop the different role she is not doing. She has been excellent at Main ho on Na and ishk vishk, but it may be that she has put a little more on paper. Anyway, great work from Barjatya. This film rejuvenates the values ​​we have forgotten. Sweet movie of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a remake, but anyway a brilliant story that is original. Soraj's films have been brilliant all the time, so we always expect something different from him. Great job from all the cast of the team and everyone. Lovely family movie to enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and loved ones. I give 10 out of 10.
