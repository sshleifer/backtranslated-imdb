Spacecamp is one of the movies kids love, and Mom and Dad can have fun watching it too. Growing up in the 80's I liked this movie, it's plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, so when I have my own kids, they can have as much fun watching this movie as I do. The plot is fun, A group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were launched into space by a supercharged robot. They were home at first, but when they realized they did not have enough oxygen to recover from panic. Once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station, they returned to Earth as best friends and a new respect for life.
