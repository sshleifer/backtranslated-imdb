This is one of the most spiritual movies I have ever seen. I drove up with about 150 people to St. George's and we saw this movie in St. George's Visitor Center. No one had dry eyes in the audience. In addition, there were some non-religious and anti-Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the film and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the history of the pioneers and the difficulties they faced because of their beliefs. /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand more about Joseph and the difficulties that the pioneers have gone through. After all, it's part of American history.
