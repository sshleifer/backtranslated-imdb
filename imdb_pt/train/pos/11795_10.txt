I will never forget this movie or the events that led to Jonestown in Guyana. It seems so tragic, but it needs to be told. Boothe powers give a command performance as leader Rev. Jim Jones from obscurity to total madness. That would easily yield an Oscar if it were released in theaters. It's the kind of miniseries you will not forget. You will not forget the images of the brutality of your leader's cult, control, and obsession. His rise and fall and the threat of the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise. Mass suicide is horrifying, almost unrealistic to anyone's imagination as to why so many people (over 900) volunteered or resisted JOnes's orders. They do not do more mini-series like these, where we get our mouths open and hungry to know what happened to others.
