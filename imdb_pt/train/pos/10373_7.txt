The family of Mat Spirogolou (Toby Malone) knows that he is a talented soccer player and is satisfied when he takes a test to join a great club. They expect that when he gets into town, his cousin will take care of him. <br /> <br /> But the cousins ​​are like chalk and cheese: a naive farmer, the other a spender who managed to mingle. with drug dealers and gangsters. Mat is unlikely to have a quiet night before his big day. <br /> <br /> Having lost his cousin George (Damien Robertson) upon arrival in the city, Mat faces more trouble when a young motorcyclist takes him for a walk. in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, probably best known for his work in theater, performs as laudable as the bucolic teenager. There are telltale signs of a low budget but, like in so many other low-budget films, there's more fun, seemingly more spontaneity, and more charm than there is to see in Hollywood's box office hit.
