This story is familiar in Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference being that two cats instead of one are threatened with being thrown away if they do not get the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an unnamed friend ("Butch?") Living in the house with him, so it really disturbs "Mammy Two Shoes" who can not believe they have a mouse despite TWO cats in the house. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the one who catches Jerry can stay while the other gets in the boot, so the competition is in progress! <br /> <br /> Although it is a familiar territory, I still liked it because the drawing had enough original visions to make it fun. You not only had the cats competing against each other, but Jerry in the equation too, so there were enough gags to recommend definitely if you were a Tom and Jerry fan.
