Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how he does it. I read books constantly, but if there's a movie with Will Smith I'll watch. He has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and arresting you there. This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I watched on Saturday and still can not get it out of my head. Incredible and sad all at the same time. Thank you again. You should watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie. You can not miss anything. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your man / woman sitting by your side so you can pet. WELL Worth the money you'll pay to watch it .. do not expect it to come on TV.
