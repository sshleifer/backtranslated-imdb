Cecil B. deMille really knew how to create a classic, and after 7 decades his western appears as the real McCoy, engaging, entertaining, spectacular; As a true fan of DEADWOOD TV, I'll tell you the performances of Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickock and Jean Arthor as Calamity Jane are much more on target. <br /> <br /> There are no more giants in Hollywood. PLAINSMAN is just one of the dozens of classics from the 1936-1945 decade that saw commercial life last decade after decade: released, reissued, reissued again. Filmmakers like today's Spielberg, Jackson, Bruckheimer are like kids playing in a litter box. None of today's movies will be sought in 7 months, let alone 70 years.
