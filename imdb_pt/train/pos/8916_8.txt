Absolutely the first movie that scared me to death. It happened when my older brother (r.i.p.) was watching. It was on a black and white TV and not really a good photo, but it interested me. Soon after, my parents bought a set of colors and, luckily, the movie The Million Dollar Movie was aired on a Sunday. <br /> <br /> I had forgotten most of the plot, but it did not take long to catch up ... and I was so scared that I had trouble sleeping that night! I'm sure it was just a movie, but it involved a creature that not only came from space, but you could not hear it, or see it ... and once it got hold of you, it was too late. Even now, after all this time, I still have a shiver down my spine. A true classic, and even better, a classic I've seen scare the pants of a new generation! <br /> <br /> Long live The Blob!
