This excellent independent film from Argentina is one of the best of the year 2000 from all over South America, including Argentina, which has produced a surprising number of quality films since 1999. Only in 2000 did Argentina release many quality films that broke the Argentina. records. Half a dozen were internationally acclaimed, like this one, at major world film festivals. After watching this film, one can see how Argentine films managed to recover last year 20% of the national film market. Directed by one of the best directors of Argentina, Daniel Burman, this film examines the effects of globalization around the world, but emphasizes its impact on Argentina, and particularly the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is wonderful as the good Jewish boy, trying to survive and even succeed in today's business climate. Hector Alterio, one of the great actors of Hispanic cinema around the world, is perfect as Simon, the Jewish father, as well as the rest of the cast, which includes Spanish and Italian stars. So many current themes in urban western societies are explored, I do not have enough space to go into detail. Daniel Burman cleverly intertwines them in the plot with different characters embodying various dilemmas. If this movie plays at a festival near you or on video, do not miss out!
