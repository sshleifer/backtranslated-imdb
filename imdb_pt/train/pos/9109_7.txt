Mainly it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest, but usually the directors start from a historical fact to talk about something else, or also show the period before or after this fact, here everything happens during that couple of days in which the revolution acts. It can also be seen as a sort of documentary. The film focuses on these two people, showing how normal they were, not as ordinary heroes, because revolution comes from people. Although it was made from the military's military title, you can understand that they were just "capitaes" as the main characters. Beautiful colors and lights throughout the film, great job for the director to be her first movie, she does not fall into the banal way. Well shown thrills and passion of the people and the crowd. The character of Maia (main) is well done and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, able to show the limits of Maia, this non-being a hero.
