I've always enjoyed watching Hong Kong movies, but they all failed to meet my expectations ... by now! The BURNING PARADISE does not contain the flat humor that most HK movies have, nor a second-line plot that has been dragged into the film. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes that are there just to fill a "clever" space (the only truly intelligent martial arts film I've seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but as Hollywood is involved, it's not a true HK movie for me ). There are incredible fight scenes in this movie from the very first (which is one of the best I've seen, but so short) to the last major scenes! But, mind, there is also a lot of blood flowing (people cut in half, beheaded, etc). The production is very good and the special effects show that the writer's fantasy can be satisfied even if some photos have to be very technical (note: the sheet of paper he plays and got stuck in a wall!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my favorite movie from Hong Kong, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure I'll take a closer look at this director! At.
