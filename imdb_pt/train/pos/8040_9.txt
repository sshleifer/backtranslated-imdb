That will be a little short. First, do not listen to the critics as it's not as bad as most say it is !! Sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many immediately rule out as flaw in the movie. Although the sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about the operation of our country's Military Snipers, it gives those who know nothing about the Professional Sniper a glimpse into the Sniper world. And yes, the movie has many flaws, but what movie does not? There are many good scenes and good performances by Tom Berenger. I have to say that the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the helicopter followed by Zane in the scene of the marine bar. The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force to sweep !! There are also many good jungle photos and some classic photos using the camera as if you were looking through a riflescope. And yes, the sniper's motto is "a shot, a kill". Judge Sniper by yourself! <br /> <br />
