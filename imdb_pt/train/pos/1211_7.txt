I grew up in this movie and I remember when my brother and I used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years, I watch the movie with my daughter and watch her have fun. If you are a parent and you did not watch this movie with your kids, then you should, just to hold them in their arms and watch them get emotional with the loving teddies and they care! The songs, especially "Forever Young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this movie to all children so they can learn how taking care of others can be fun! When it comes to all the junk that is on TV, you can raise your kids to have the right mindset about life with movies like these.
