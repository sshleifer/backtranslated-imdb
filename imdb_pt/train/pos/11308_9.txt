TCM is keeping me awake all the time ... they keep coming up with movies I've never heard of ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... a very old movie from Visconti !! ... wow ... the Italian version of the postman always rings twice ... brilliant !! beautifully acted and directed ... Never heard of any leads that were excellent, Clara Calamai, as Giovanna, and especially Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 !!! His look was ahead of his time ... many male stars of the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he should have been a big superstar! Is the film far better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less brilliant than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner remembering that white outfit? who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a very different end ... see watch it ... I'm going to buy it!
