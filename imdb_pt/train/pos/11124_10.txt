THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> Number 1 - All-Time TV <br /> <br /> Everyone thought it would be a stupid thing to be just a pilot episode. The Sopranos have become a cultural phenomenon and universally accepted as one of the greatest television programs of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic crime boss in New Jersey, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a stellar cast. Edie Falco is superb as the worrying and loving mother of the upper middle class; Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious and graying consiglieri who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> Although the series has often been criticized for the negative stereotype of Italian Americans as mafiosi, and to some extent this is undeniable, I see many positive aspects of the program. The portrait of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; Could this be on a coarse TV show about gangsters? Yes. In addition, other burning issues are discussed, such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. This is not a superficial and boring show about tough guys and violence. There is a lot more. Many of the issues we see in the program are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing, which has been very good, successively infused current editions and managed to immerse them within the lives of the characters, which makes the whole thing more interesting. should go to David Chase, who created an excellent treasure trove of television and to James Gandolfini, to visualize, the most complex and enigmatic character of television. <br /> <br /> Simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> 10/10
