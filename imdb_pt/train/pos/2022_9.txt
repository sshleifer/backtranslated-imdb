The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexualized. Things that were only suggested in the novel are shown on the screen for some strange reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to figure out if they did not show it all right? Other than that, this is of very good quality. All actors do wonderful work, bringing their characters to life. For shallow women out there, it's worth watching, at least, because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing of all. If I were Helen, I would have conveniently forgotten that I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him ... <br /> <br /> Half a spoiler - The final scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.
