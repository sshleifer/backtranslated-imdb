As someone who never condescended to Adam Sandler in terms of talent, how it is done with him and many comedic actors like him, I joined Reign Over Me expecting a great movie, not just because of its presence in the film but because I thought which looked very good overall. Even someone who has ever thought that Sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that I was surprised at how fantastic he is at it. It will make you cry, especially in your intentionally sudden and unexpected monologue. What's surprising about his role is that it's a character that's hard to say we've seen before. We have seen many emotionally scarred characters, many mentally retarded, many loners, many passionate selfish artists, but Sandler's Charlie Fineman is nothing of the sort. He may have a taste of each of them in some ways, but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual. It is a joy for the audience to be drawn emotionally by him and be pulled in every way by someone whose problems, mentality and taunts are completely different from most characters like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle offers an interesting. performance on a completely different level. He is every man. He is the most normal person possible in the world, so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his, or at least anyone who plays like he plays Alan Johnson, whose name is found on the assembly line. Cheadle is brilliant because he's funny, boring, smart and stupid like so many normal people are. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who have almost never done anything for a while. in smaller, but rather colorful papers. Jada Pinkett-Smith is the overly refined wife of the upper middle class, Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge, Robert Klein is Sandler's desensitized father-in-law. <br /> <br /> Mike Binder's script is brilliant because it says something very deep about the wonders of communication in all its forms. It is much more subtle than, say, Babel, and has a much closer home ideal. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the reality of your images as opposed to mere style. This film seemed like a kind of consignment to the kitchen sink style of the 1970s. The photograph was grainy and untied, but that was its charm. It was not about attracting us to the camera itself and the glow that would have diluted its stories with such. <br /> <br /> The music, which plays an important role in the film, and its title, is very powerful. Near the beginning, you feel like you're on another soundtrack of About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine, but you soon realize that you're involved in more than that. In fact, the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates many of the most emotional scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is an important statement not only for society but also for the film itself. This shows that even the director of Blankman is capable of doing wonders.
