Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are a great couple and demonstrate this with their unique charisma presented in this film. <br /> <br /> This is the typical "alternative" or indie film with a plot that presents a rare situation that suddenly becomes really important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is a middle-aged boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is taking pictures of the exotic inhabitants of the small town where he lives. Suddenly, an alternative artist watches his work and hires him to expose his work at some important festivals and much more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life changes drastically, as fortune and fame now seem to infuriate the townspeople who are the main inspiration of Pecker. Even his sexy girlfriend gets mad because now he does not pay "proper" attention to her. <br /> <br /> Well, this is an Indie movie with an edge, but not for everyone. It may sound boring or pretentious to some people, but I still find it worth watching just because it offers something "different" than the typical Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> To describe in a nutshell: This is the typical Christina. Movie by Ricci and John Waters. It is. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the "Full of Grace" lines are really annoying. Wow.
