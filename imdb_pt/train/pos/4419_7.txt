I saw this movie and I heard screenwriter and director Juan Gerard speak at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> All I knew was that it was the story of an 8-year-old movie. an old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family. <br /> <br /> His opening scene will bring to mind "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film is replete with references to classic films: The Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "chicken crying" (references to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"); you'll find more. The homeless (Georg Stanford Brown) is a reference to Cuban folklore that often uses a black man as a type of Greek choir. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is is the culmination of a dream. Gerard's desire to honor his family and a half-movie that he has loved all his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real, just like the events described. Gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover), but his dream was to make that movie. He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star. Keitel holds the screen mightily as the mysterious and secret grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) offer strong support in key roles. <br /> <br /> In fact, the first half of the movie suffers from the rigid delivery of lines, and some retractions, but stick with it. The last half is much better, as the events of the revolution combine with the bittersweet and honest climate. It is the first effort of Juan Gerard, but he is honest as he is and his passion and heart really pass in this first sincere effort. I would definitely see her again, and hopefully he will continue his film career. <br /> <br />
