I rented Zero Day from the video store last week. I had never heard of the movie and I had my reservations about it. Just from looking at the box I knew the film was an Indie film and therefore the quality would be lower than a mainstream movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day I immediately started over. The film clearly followed the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how believable the two protagonists were. My first time watching this movie I was not sure if what I was watching were real tapes left behind by the sharpshooters at Columbine. Deep in my mind I knew that what I was watching could not be real, but at the same time the acting was so compelling that you had to keep shaking your head. <br /> <br /> Is the film disturbing? Absolutely! Are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the movie? Probably. I think what most people will find disturbing is that they will actually have feelings for the two protagonists, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is this problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre plan a massacre at their school. I know for myself, I felt an immense sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them, because their lives had reached such a horrible spot. They had fallen so deep through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road that might have been stopped, if at least the people around had noticed their situation. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. It gives you a close up and personal look at events that most of us will only see the conclusion about the news. It leaves you thinking about the lives involved. And that puzzles you how people get to that point. A week after watching this movie, I still think about it. <br /> <br /> Those of you who have not seen Zero Day, please keep in mind the following: The film is an independent film with little or no budget and the film is filmed on camcorders. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not the Hollywood mainstream and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put all that aside, Zero Day is a movie that will stay with you and maybe help you open your eyes a little.
