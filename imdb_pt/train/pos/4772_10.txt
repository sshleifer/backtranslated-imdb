This movie is perhaps the most touching and uplifting I have ever seen. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great work of art as this film can give me an almost religious experience. Suddenly, I realize that there really is a meaning to life. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical. I thought the plot seemed artificial and I was afraid the story would be banal. But being a fan of David Lynch, I decided to give it a try. It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the film, but then I was completely lost. There is a lot of wisdom and warmth in this movie! I left the theater feeling that I had really learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not a typical David Lynch movie, and somehow it was very surprising that he made such a movie after exploring the film. dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, it does not surprise me that he succeeds in imparting deep emotions and deep human insight, because I also found that he did it very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors and I think The Straight Story is the best of all. 9,5 / 10
