I met at six-seven while watching this one. Altman's touch with zoom in and out was there, and I expected these gadgets to comment on characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I could see, sometimes they were free, sometimes witty, often sterile for failing to point out some ironic connection or another. In particular, two zoom-outs of the golden dome in Savannah just perplexed. To be fair, however, some zooms (outs and ins) for Branagh added to the growing bewilderment of his character, such as Pudgy McCabe or Philip Marlow. Overall, the zooms were, well, inconsistent and sometimes banal. <br /> <br /> Other Almanes devices, like several glass panels between the camera and the subject, have been able to suggest the scandal or the narcissism of the characters or opaque. states of knowledge. Car windshields, house windows and other screens were used effectively and reasonably consistently, I remember, fidgeting in the PLAYER and even in LONG GOODBYE. Some captivating jumps, especially for a suggestive TV commercial, reminded me of such use in short cuts, for sarcastic purposes. <br /> <br /> But finally, the mismatch between Altman's very personal style and the momentum of the Grisham genre, could not excite me. The director's masterpieces of the 1970s reviewed and deconstructed several classic genres, including the detective film that resembled in some ways; this time the director seemed to have few arrows in his analytical quiver to strike any significant blow at the weak spot of this beastly genre. He was gagged by mammography producers, maybe? Or am I missing something because of my poor knowledge of the genre he assumes here? <br /> <br /> In spite of everything, the cast was excellent: Tom Berenger (for his terrifying ferocity), Branagh for him (deflated) Arrogance, Robert Downey Jr.'s pheromonal haze, Robert Duvall's trash method and the female fatality on the lookout for Davidtz were almost all perfect choices. And with the exception of a few stretches from Georgia to Chicago by (brunette?) Daryl Hannah, the accents were convincingly southern. <br /> <br /> Suspense and humor were absorbing, even if the story was not well defined. viewers. The mood of a barometric dive before the hurricane on the coast was exquisitely meticulously rendered-I felt like yelling at the receptionist to turn on the cooler in the swamp immediately. <br /> <br /> Torn, in the end I judged a 7. <br /> <br />
