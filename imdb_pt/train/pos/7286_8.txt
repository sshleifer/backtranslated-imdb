I had a great time seeing this photo and was splendidly surprised by its more erudite features. Firstly, the film is undeniably cheap with its cardboard sets, limited configurations and creative scientific props. The acting ranges from very poor (the two strippers), almost professional (Herb Evers as protagonist), Gothic exaggeration (Leslie Daniels as assistant Kurt) the first with Virginia Leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against his will in benefit of science and the lascivious passions of his bride. The script is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for such a movie. Questions are plentiful about the role that science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This movie is a thinking movie in many ways. However, do not be much fooled by your actual intention. It is a despicable story about a man obsessed with his medical science aptitude who wants to fuse the dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thus creating the perfect woman for a man with the best body and soul. Another very bright aspect of the film is saxophone music that resonates strongly every time the doctor walks the city in search of female beauties.
