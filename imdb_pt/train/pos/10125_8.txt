This film is the first in the trinity of the trio Miikes society, and the trilogy has a great start. The trilogy films are only linked thematically, and these themes are really apparent in all of your movies, if you look closely. The Shinjuku Triad Society is about a policeman trying to prevent his younger brother getting too involved with a gang of strangers, struggling to reach the top of Tokyos yakuza. The younger brother is a lawyer, and the gang triad is increasingly in need of one, as the film progresses. The film takes place in a very tough environment and therefore is quite violent and difficult. Miike did the worst, but since this is a serious movie, it's very difficult. As usual, there is also much perverted sex, mostly homosexual in this. The film is, in many ways, a typical gangster movie, but with great performance and true cunning. If you've only seen Miikes movies (Ichi, the killer, Fudoh, etc.), it's worth checking out, since it's a kind of compromise between your over-aggressive aggressive style appearing in these films and their more serious side. , as seen in the other films in the trilogy. And as always with Miike, there are at least two scenes in this that you will NEVER forget (see and find out which ones for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
