Watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop that occurred in the original release, I'm surprised at how well it has held. One of the reasons for the failure was that a generation just thought it was indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed not to show all hippie glory. Seen now, it is clear that Antonioni was already aware and fascinated by the heady mixture of fervent enthusiasm for change and lack of a clear vision for the future. The lead pair is excellent and it is shameful that they have received so much criticism for the perceived flaw in the film. They are ideal and perfectly convey the various contradictions and show pure pleasure in making love. I blame others for the excessive emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the beginning, but I have to say that from this in this is one of the most beautiful directors portraits and he certainly made the best use of natural and man-made landscapes. Oh, and I did not even mention the highly explosive ending.
