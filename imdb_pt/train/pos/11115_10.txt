I believe The Sopranos is an incredible show because of all the supporting characters in it. I bought all the videos so far and I'm waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far, the best is definitely episode # 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance. This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was amazing because he was actually one of the few characters who really opposed Tony and his gang. In the end, he ended up getting shot in the eye while showering, and this is my favorite scene in The Sopranos story. Brendan Filone is number 1 for me. And my favorite character number 2 was Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after attempting to assassinate Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him at Hucklebarney Park after they pick him up and torture him. My favorite character number 3 is Sean Gismonte, who was killed shortly after filming Christopher. And finally, my favorite character number 4 is Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the incredible characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about the Sopranos. All the cool guys are always dead. Do you know what would be great to change about the Sopranos? They must have an entire episode where they show all support characters killed in hell and they are all trying to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie because they need revenge. Brendan Filone should strike back !!!!!!!!! 1
