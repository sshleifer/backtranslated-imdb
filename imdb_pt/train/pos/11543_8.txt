Neil Simon has a good body of work, but it's the strange couple that brought him to fame. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have great chemistry. The supporting cast for this movie is stellar as well. <br /> <br /> It's about 2 men living together that are from opposite planets. The script gets irritated with humor from this situation. This has been done in some ways previously. This is the only one that brings all this together in a very good package. <br /> <br /> Simon did another decent job, but this is really his best job that made the rest of his work possible. It's hard to imagine Simon getting to the top of it.
