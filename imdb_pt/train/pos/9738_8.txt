Oh dear, do not we like it when our love interest for superheroes develops a brain us? <br /> <br /> Something happened to people, they lost the ability to enjoy, simple well-being, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed out loud ooh at least five times and I'm not ashamed to say I had a tear in my eye a couple of times either. The cast, the acting and the script are great, I watch a lot of movies and I did not see any of that genre that was so successful. Those who disagree, please tell me where I can find some! I'm sure the book is good too, but I think you have to judge it by your own merits.
