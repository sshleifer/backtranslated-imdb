As an adult in my early 40s, I'm nowhere near any of the major demographics of "Nancy Drew," but I was pleasantly surprised by the movie this afternoon; So, I could tell, the pair of sixty-year-old gray-haired ladies in front of me. The older man who left the theater right in front of me specifically praised the film for the 20-year-old presenter (who said she had seen the movie the night before and really liked it). More to the point, though: in the row ahead of me, there were nine - counting them, nine- and ten-year-old girls lined up side by side, passing popcorn, hot dogs, and candy on one side to the other and giggling. Once the movie started, they promptly settled in to watch .... <br /> <br /> ... and did not peep until the final credits began rolling. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie; it's no use paying your high school subplots, you're not confident enough in your own tone, and your henchmen are just a hair too far away to be critically inept at times. But the adaptation of the original material is essentially respectful, the plot fits reasonably well, and treads deftly between the sins of excessive extravagance and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts carries the film with surprising grace - despite the excellent timing of Josh Flitter, this is Roberts' movie, and she does it beautifully. His Nancy Drew is very much the direct ancestor of Veronica Mars, of Kristen Bell, and the film is also a direct descendant of "Candleshoe", of Jodie Foster. <br /> <br /> In today's market, it's a rarity: a family movie that respects the intelligence of its viewers. As such, it will not be to everyone's taste - but for what it is, it's the best film of its kind in decades.
