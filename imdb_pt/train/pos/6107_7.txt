Then I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why the hell was this movie such a big hit at the Korean box office?" Even though the film had a clever / unusal scenario, the acting was not so good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I liked the fight scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, this is the movie for you. But I have to admit ... the movie was kind of childish ... 6/10
