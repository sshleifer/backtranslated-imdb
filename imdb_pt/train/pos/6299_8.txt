There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this is very the first. This little task requires nothing more than what it gives to the public. It presents a simple story, told very clearly, with enough jokes to keep it, and then gets better and better. Clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome, but the protagonists, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily do this on their own. Nice and funny, hilarious in the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the assault genre.
