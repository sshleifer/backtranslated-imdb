First of all, I loved Bruce Broughton's soundtrack, very lyric, and this in itself contributed to the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film was the three animals, superlatively expressed by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather engaging character (the voice of reason), and Field adds insight to a character who is always seen counting Chance. Humans were not so engaging, and sometimes the movie dragged on, but that's my only complaint. This is a beautiful film with beautiful plans from Canada, I think. Although the film itself is rather long, there is never a seriously monotonous moment, and this is favored by voice work and a well-written script. All in all, a lovely and perhaps underrated film, with a 9/10 of me. Bethany Cox.
