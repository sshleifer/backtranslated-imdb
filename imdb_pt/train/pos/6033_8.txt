I would just like to state that this may be biased since I am a producer on the film. However, I will retain some sense of dignity. The star of the film, Oscar Ovies, gives a stellar performance as Jeff Grinderlin, a hypochondriac who spends more time caring than living. It brings a certain touch to your character that actually allows the audience to connect with him, asserting his mind often and with a sense of harsh comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the constant supporting beam, which without it would crumble. His friends also lend a hand in Jeff's life, often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will ... which he often neglects is there anyway. <br /> <br /> The writing is superb, and the conversations flow like scenes from a Kevin Smith movie, with half of the Ben Affleck festivals. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is a bit of poor quality at some points, and the sound could also use a boost, however, the performances shine the small details. It is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a treat. A rare jewel among many jewels.
