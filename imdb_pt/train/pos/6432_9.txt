Thanks to an intelligent script and a firm hand by writer / director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is a fun and very pleasant mystery thriller. The movie begins methodically and builds steam as the clues begin to reveal that nothing is what it appears to be. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are great as they unite to unravel the mystery, reminding me of Nick and Nora Charles from the movie "Thin Man." Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Alex McArthur's tormented woman and the character roles played by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris are well made and provide many moments of light at the right time. There is even a special participation of Rex Linn. All in all, I felt I was reading a good book by the fire.
