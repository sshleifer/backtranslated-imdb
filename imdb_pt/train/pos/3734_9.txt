The dehumanizing effect of war is a subject studied in cinema; as well as the dehumanizing, equally dehumanizing, but potentially life-saving, military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard model, we see men treated like dirt, but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect by their commanding officers, and judgment is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is the judgment of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting vision by focusing his account on an arrogant dissident named Bozz (played exceptionally well by Colin Farrell) who understands that all power ultimately governs by consent, and the lack of awareness among the impotent ones of their own complicity. . Around this character, a taught and exciting storyline was built, and it's also an advantage that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, to name just another film of a similar kind, lost focus once that the action moved to Asia). Although this is not a film of striking originality, it is extremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film of this director I have seen, and among the best of its kind.
