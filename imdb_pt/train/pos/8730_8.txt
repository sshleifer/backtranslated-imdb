Many of the Americans would say ... What ??? for my opening comment. Yes, I know my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to Master Akira Kurosawa's fans, but if you review this movie, my comment is correct. We have the peasant who goes to town for help against a pack of locusts who wants to steal the harvest from the village. The big difference is the path that history takes. Our samurai, a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mix of personalities, but in the end are what the village needs, HEROES. Please watch this amazing movie again (the Seven Samurai, of course) and find other movies that stole the story and tried to achieve the same magical effect as Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. One tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write his best seller, but he did not find the cat's third foot.
