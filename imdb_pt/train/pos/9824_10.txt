This movie is a prime example of the state of B movies: erotic porn movies without the hardcore sex. The plot in this is not as bad as these things go; involves a lawyer trying to prove that her lover is innocent of killing his wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves something to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad looks, bad sets, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scenes. Filmmakers must learn the difference between erotic and erotic. They do not even have the good sense to have Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How stupid is that?
