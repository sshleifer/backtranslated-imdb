Moon Child was one of the most symbolic films I have ever seen. What I really liked was the illustration on immorality / mortality and obstacles and lifelong guidance. The movie shows a lot of Kei vampires having the power of immorality and the advantages to it. Whether it's supernatural abilities or eternal life, these are the things that humans usually want. Moon Child shows the pain and drawbacks of being immortal, since feelings about loss affect almost every character, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title 'Moon Child' reveals how the film comes near the end, where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon that shines in the way of other people, giving guidance. I personality very similar to the moral of the film portrayed. The film's weaknesses are in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic. The scene in which the character Toshi dies might have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in acting were put into it. Some scenes with special effects like shots could also be more authentic without looking too much like an action videogame. The sparks that came out of the guns seemed too fake and I think this could have been eliminated or corrected. However, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider watching. The symbolic ideas and images that the film brings would be easily accepted by all and may interest many viewers. It is a very attentive movie and also fun to watch.
