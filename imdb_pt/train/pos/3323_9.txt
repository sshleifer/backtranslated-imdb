I've been in this movie for a month now and I'm a fan of Drew Barrymore. I love a happy ending and this movie gives a brilliant with the truths of the boxed Red Sox! It's about a math teacher who takes some promising kids on a math trip to a company where successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them some information. This then leads to the courtship of Ben (teacher) and Lindsey. But not everything is simple when he confesses that he is a big fan of the Red Sox. <br /> <br /> First of all, that's fine, but his baseball upset Lindsey's life. It's okay at the end and it took a shot to get Drew running through the field !! I got two pounds at Blockbusters, so I was happy. If you like movies like this, I suggest you watch a little more of Drew's work as Charlie's Angels and the first 50 shows, or even his new movie with Hugh Grant, called Music and Lyrics.
