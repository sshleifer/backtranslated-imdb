I'll always have a crush on this Disney movie, another of its live action / animated parts that sought to recreate the success of "Mary Poppins" and never succeeded. When I was in school, from time to time, we had a movie day, where the whole school crowded into the cafeteria, and a movie would be designed the old way, with lots of rolls and all. At the time, it seemed like a very important occasion when that day came, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the movies I remember seeing it that way. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, it's very charming. . Angela Lansbury never put her name on something that was not at least competent, and she's winning here like a witch with a magic bed (boy, that can be misunderstood, right?), Who can take her and a couple of young children on magical adventures to distant places. Come on, what child would not like a bed like that? <br /> <br /> Grade: A
