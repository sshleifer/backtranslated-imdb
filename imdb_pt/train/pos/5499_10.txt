I had no idea of ​​the facts that this movie presents. In reminding myself of this situation, I accepted the information presented in the media: a confusing event around a dubious personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if something of that caliber has already been made. I assumed that the protagonist was Mr. Chávez, but all that appeared in the photo were important and, in the end, the reality of this entelechy: the people, was overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
