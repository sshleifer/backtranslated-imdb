This is one of the best films of 2002. It may not be the best film, but it looks like the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) in one of his works. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay, but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) puts his father and Michael, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. As Michael is a respected man within the organization, he tries to win some friends who can help him, including Mafia boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> In a way, 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie. but it's so well done that you almost can not see it. This film is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and above all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense, although the result is quite right. That Hoechlin is not a boring child and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to help, of course. <br /> <br /> Based on a comic book, this movie is much better than you'd expect and although it has flaws belongs to the best films of its kind. Sometimes there are events where you realize that you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will seem familiar at times but is totally new in many areas.
