Okay, I know this does not design India in a good light. But the overall theme of the film is not India, it's Shakti. The power of a warlord and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son engulf you in their heat. Then things go terribly wrong. The interaction between Nandini and his father-in-law - the power of his dysfunctional relationship - and the lives modified by him are the strengths of this film. The performance of the Shah Rukh Khan seems to be a mere apparition compared to the credible despair of Karisma Kapoor. It's easy to get involved with the love, violence and redemption of lives in this movie and find a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax. Musical interludes are strong, believable, and well made.
