In another of Bugs Bunny's dismal short films, the famous Leporid * works in a department store window when owner Gildersleeve decides to fill it. Of course this is almost impossible, since Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when to cross-dress). As always, they keep everything at high speed, and you have to wonder how hilarious this design must have looked like when it debuted! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how the Looney Tunes looked like in the 1940s before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them. But do not get me wrong, the cartoons were still very good after the refined shapes arrived. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a great one. <br /> <br /> * Leporids are rabbits and hares. .
