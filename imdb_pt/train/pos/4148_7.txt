Let's make one thing clear: this film does not seek to redefine the genre, it is not Dr. Strangelove the Young Frankenstein. It's a silly movie with three great characters (no other comedy with similar characteristics), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler from SNL, and indie queen Parker Posey, as charming as ever. The story is basic: the three girls were "losers" in college, and are still after them. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can not even get a date with a blind man), Posey is an assistant to a senator (who "has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in office" ... I picked it up a few minutes later .. I'm a bit slow, OK!), and Dracht has a gay fiancee (Seth Meyers from SNL, funny). They have to prevent the uncool daughter of the senator (the always lovely Amber Tamblyn from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") to embarrass her during spring break. So of course they have to go look after it, and some joy happens. All in all, a light and simple comedy, quite short and quite pleasant
