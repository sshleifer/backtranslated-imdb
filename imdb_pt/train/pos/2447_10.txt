George Lopez has never caught my attention in his stand-up comedy and yet has not. But this show is a work of art. It is never to show where the jokes make you laugh every time you remember (and jokes that it is memorable). This show has an optimistic look and the characters range from an old drunk to a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who writes this program, but this person does a great job. If they had just finished the show, I'm sure they would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good and traditional comedy, then George Lopez is the show for you! The only bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Same? Imagine the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air being "Will Smith." Come on, man! But on the other hand, this show is great! 10/10
