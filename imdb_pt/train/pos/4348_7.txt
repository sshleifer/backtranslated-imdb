Paul Reiser steps away from the spotlight of comedy standup to write a warmly humored and gentle story about the family - what we see and what we do not see, what we expect, and what surprises us. THE THING ON MY PEOPLES does not set a new standard for cinema, but it is a short story well told that reminds us of the significant ties that the family represents. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been addicted to work, sometimes pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) in the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she's leaving! His daughters along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin to search for his whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntled Sam to settle things on a trip with son Ben. The trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who the other is and what each one means for their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living. The journey comes to an end with a phone call about Muriel's whereabouts and why she left and the wisest family reunion draws the warm ending of the story. Everything is not what it seemed: it is better and, well, different. Falk and Reiser play against each other like the pros who are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is onscreen, reminding us that she is one of our matriarchs movies. Worth seeing. Grady Harp
