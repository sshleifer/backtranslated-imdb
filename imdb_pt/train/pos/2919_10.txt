I've seen the movie twice in the space of a week, both times at a movie theater in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was crowded both times and people had to be turned away. From the beginning of the film, with Henry Winkler getting 'wounded' on the football field, the whole audience was in laughter, laughter that lasted until the credits. <br /> <br /> For those who love American wrestling, this movie is a must, but be ready to see Henry Winkler like you've never seen him before. Also look for a well-known actor, whose trademark wrestling move is head but! <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to watch this movie and it's family entertainment comedy at its best!
