As in Amelie, recent French films seem to be taking a stereotypical stance of relationship between men and women, centered on a woman who finds true love. In this case, despair leads to a convict, which leads his evolution into a prototype mob. Smart and amazing story in many ways except that the female is there to support the male. <br /> <br /> For those of us who do not speak French, subtitles are a bit quick, but they are not irrational. The soundtrack, as it seems to be increasingly the case of European films, is great and is in perfect sync with the variations of the film. Nothing seems forced. Visually this reminds me of several urban horror movies. There's a Wes Craven in Chicago to feel it.
