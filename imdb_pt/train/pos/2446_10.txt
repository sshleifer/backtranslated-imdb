From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her ?! The show is not the same as it was before. Your path is worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can not replace someone from the beginning! That's like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! It's not right! The niece who replaced her is just, ugh! Horrible. She does not fit the plot at all. She was one of the main characters, and the niece can not replace her. She was an incredible actress. Much better than the niece. Reclaim it or you will lose a ton of viewers.
