Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty. He was harassed and beaten in high school. A group of children threw several pieces at him, and these jokes were really bad. The last game ended tragically. <br /> <br /> Suggestion for 5 years later. The boys' class meets again for a meeting. One of them rode the old college. The school is now abandoned and they have to enter. For some reason, the janitor is still there, but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer. <br /> <br /> They start partying, and looking at their old lockers, and they see something from Marty. One girl feels sorry for Marty, but another guy calms her down. <br /> <br /> Once the kills start, it's great. Each death is creative and bloody. We see a figure in a jester mask, hunting them one by one across the school. Looks like Marty's back on his revenge. After the first person is killed, they find that they are locked in school. They start looking for a way out. <br /> <br /> Now, there are several illogical things in this movie. First of all, I do not know anyone who has a 5 year meeting. Second, after the first kid dies, a girl gets blood on her. Everyone fled in a panic, but she runs into the bathroom and finds a bathtub. Hrr friend has just been killed, and she decides to take a shower !? More importantly, why is there a tub in the school bathroom? Anyway, the tub does not really seem to work ... and she dies a horrible death this is an 80's movie. It's a terror of terror. Who cares if there are some illogical parts. I dont understand. This movie has great deaths. The end .... there is a twist. Having recently seen Haute Tension, I can compare the two. The only way they are similar is that there is a twist, which kinda has left me disappointed ..... THEN soon after the turnaround, comes a great, if not the best, kill in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the last death, the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy, and it was the perfect way to end the movie. Has me going "wow ..."
