For those who liked the series, this movie will be something to watch. However, it also leaves you wanting more. I loved the way every character (detective) made an appearance. Less with the end of who's the fourth chair because they leave a reason for another movie. My guess is Bayless, of course. This, like the series, was a series of very well-done scenes. This is a series that I wish I had lived through. Thanks to the cast for some wonderful TV.
