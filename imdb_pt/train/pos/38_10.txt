One of the best shorts from the Three Stooges of all time. A scary house full of evil guys and "The Goon" challenge the best men of the Alerts Detective Agency. Shemp is at his best in the famous scene of darkness. Emil Sitka provides excellent support in his role as Mr. Goodrich as the target of a murder plan. Before finishing, Shemp's "little shovel" is used to great effect. This 16 minute jewelry moves as fast as any Stooge is short and packs double wallop. Highly recommended.
