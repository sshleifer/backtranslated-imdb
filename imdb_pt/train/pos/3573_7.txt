this film was almost a great imaginative film. A mix of shakespeare, pop, jazz and fairy tales. This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. Featuring a strong cast, headlined by the perfectly cast Kathleen Turner, this movie had everything going for it. Everything but production values. I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or large budgets, but with such an exaggerated production, it came out with the same decadent quality of all the other made for the TV movie. In addition to better cinematography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
