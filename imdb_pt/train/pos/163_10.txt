First director Tom Kiesche transforms into a winning film in the spirit of the cut, somber comedy. Filmed on a tight budget, it still had the taste of Brother Coen's first film Blood Simple ... and threw some Monty Python flavors to boot! It needs to be seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that take one scene to the next. Expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor.
