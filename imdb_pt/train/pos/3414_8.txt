This interesting documentary tells an incredible story of an expedition to take blind Tibetan children to hike in the Himalayas; but also of a clash of personality between two remarkable people. On the one hand, there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, and the team of mountaineers (sighted) who are guiding the children. On the other side is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans, who agrees with the expedition, but then has doubts about how she is progressing. At some level, Sabine simply does not understand the climber's philosophy (with emphasis on summit); she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the goals of the climbers and the desires of the children, but her certainty in her own correction makes her a difficult person to sympathize with, especially since she has an effective veto. Against the background of this confrontation (reasonably well-educated), we have a vision of the children's own lives. I liked the movie, although it does provide a message clearly designed to be uplifting - even if it details the fight, the film claims a bit relentlessly incredible as all those who appear on it are. But it is difficult to argue with this assessment, even if it is presented to the viewer in a somewhat insipid manner.
