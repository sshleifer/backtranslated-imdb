After seeing several Villaronga films, I had a very clear opinion about him - he focuses a lot on the personal aspect of the characters, forgetting the rhythm of the film. That's why, despite having good critics, his films have never caught the attention of the broad public. In ARo he follows the same line, but really improved the pace, especially at the end of the film. Frankly speaking, I slept in the first part, because although the first part gives the necessary information, it is very slow. However, the second part is absolutely wonderful and makes the whole film the best film ever made by Villaronga. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
