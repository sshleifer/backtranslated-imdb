Wow, I forgot how great this movie was until I stumbled on it as I looked around the garage. It's kind of a weird combination of a Michael Jackson biography, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a superhero struggling to save some kids. The vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment in which Michael Jackson transforms into a car, a robot and finally a spaceship (and it's as strange as it looks ). Joe Pesci is hilarious, and has quite cool pictures and great music to entertain everywhere! <br /> <br /> The real gem, however, is the incredible "Smooth Criminal" video that makes the movie worth it for that part!
