This is a true 1980s movie: At that time they made maybe 100 times more movies than they do today, and that makes a lot of them very interesting ... It was a cultural phenomenon, which no longer exists. Nowadays perhaps the same kind of person who would have made cheap "direct to video" movies in the 1980s, is making cheap porn. Porn seems to sell. Anyway, this is above the average level of rubbish: it has a good, fascinating story, and it's well done, I think. In one scene, you may even see the microphone bobbing at the top edge of the image. Of course there are also small appearances by Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute much to the success of the film, although they are good in their small roles. The monster, heavy singer "Sammi Curr", looks really terrible, especially when he is singing. One of the scariest monsters I've ever seen in horror movies. I can have nightmares with him the next night. Not recommended for lovers of intellectual films.
