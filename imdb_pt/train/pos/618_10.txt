This movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I was 'delighted', I must say, and surprised because of how it was done in a unique way. The cast, the sequencing, the effects ... everything! Magnificent! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what stood out from the rest was that it was told in a fun and healthy way. <br /> <br /> For me, it is the representation of the modern fairy tale. . It's like the modern peter pan ... simply amazing. <br /> <br /> I would certainly buy a copy of it by the time it hits the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a couple movie MUST SEE 1 ... !!!! 10 stars for this!
