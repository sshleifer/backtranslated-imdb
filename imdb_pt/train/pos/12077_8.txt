I really enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller about a young woman, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross) who is unemployed and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and runs to try to get that position. Julia takes the job and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty), who demands that she live with her employer in her home and has no involvement with male friends, and Julia says she has no family and is free. dedicate all their time to this work. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is Mrs. Hughes' son and has some very strange wishes for playing with knives. This was a low budget movie and most of the scenes were close-ups in order to avoid the expense of a fund and the costs to the scenario. This strange family lives in a huge mansion in Cornwall of England and there are secret doors and very suspense.
