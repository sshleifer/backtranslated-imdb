It's not a bad movie. Somehow I was made to really cheer for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I did not know anything about football and I'm not a fan. The end of the bus was exciting. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran, and how they can not get into sports arenas among men, because their oaths are inappropriate for women to hear. . Despite this law, some women try to infiltrate, but many are picked up and detained. It is truly amazing that any society can still have old-fashioned notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi says his films are history documents and their injustices, and that one day in the future we can watch those films and see how Iran lived. The future is expected to arrive sooner rather than later.
