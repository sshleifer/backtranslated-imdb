When I was a kid, my parents got this movie for me to watch. I really enjoyed it and watched it over and over again. Even when I was in 3rd grade I still watched from time to time. Recently I watched it again just for the sake of nostalgia, and although the show was not geared towards my age group (I'm late in my teens), I still found it fun and educational. This program teaches good lessons about imagination and gets on well with others. Some parts I found quite amusing. Also, this program does not have any bad content, so you can leave the kids alone with this program and not worry about them picking up bad language or something. I would recommend this.
