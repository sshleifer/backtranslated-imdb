What would you expect from a movie titled 'Surviving Christmas' and presented as 'festive fun', something like Ghandi or patient English? There are many things I love about this movie, it's funny, it's very well produced and it's superbly written. I came to the film as a fan of Kaplan / Elfort, but I doubted it when I read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. But the film does not come out that way because Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays perfectly, one minute an adult infant, the next a mature man who realizes that he has won everything in life beyond what he really wants. In fact, we see Latham grow up in this movie, when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realizes that their lives are not so good, he sees that his own luck is not so bad. <br /> <br /> The movie has fewer weak or weak scenes than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is a lot harder than any other kind of drama, whether it works or not, and very few comedy writers ever get it right. I particularly loved the drama scene where the family takes to read the parts written by Latham. The pleasure lies in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). It's the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue, wear silly hats or sing for the Christmas tree in order to win the cash prize that keeps the movie moving well. <br /> <br /> Daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) for the story brings a delightful romantic angle, and why not on a Christmas film? Of course it's mushy and artificial; he is rich and beautiful, she is beautiful and single, and inevitably she and Afflect end up falling together in the snow and meeting face to face. Great! One thing I would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but I really can not complain. I got what I wanted.
