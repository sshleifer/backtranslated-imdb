wow, how can I discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes? It was certainly the highlight of my year - no - my life. As if the raptor's graphics were not surprising enough, the award-winning editors continued to use the same photo throughout the film, even when the background did not match the setting of the scene. Wow, what a genius. And while the movie is full of plot holes (for example, some clips of a T-Rex type animal where a raptor should be and a key moment where Pappy finds a torture chamber, he yells "Colin's a girl!" I'll never forget the sparkle that is Raptor Planet. Thank you Sci-Fi for another classic.
