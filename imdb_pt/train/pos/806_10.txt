Star Wars: Episode 4. The best Star Wars of all time. It's the first movie I ever Sean were the thugs beat and it's a pretty good ending. I really had to wait for the hing for the next star wars, because things about the matches appear in this movie that you just discovered in the last movie. With many movies I always have the impression that this may be impossible, but not with this one. And I'll never forget that the part I saw was Luke, he's your father. I also love the figure of Bob's talent and he is a background player. If you've never seen a Star Wars movie, go to it. It's the best. Thank you Lucas
