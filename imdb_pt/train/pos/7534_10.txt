I totally disagree with the other comments. It's all basically negative. I took a chance on this movie and was glad I did .Grad, in fact. I could not find anything wrong with it.Now period.The script is original. actors are all nice and convincing.Dee Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady's Brady Bunch. But this girl really can act. The setup in the Australian Outback is flawless. Awesome par. Great soundtrack ie Paul Kelly.God bless Paul Kelly. The Cranberries are also seen this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably watch it again. It's interesting. It makes you think. It's probably probably better than nine-tenths of the so-called Hollywood blockbusters. which were also out during this time.Back Of Beyond is a likable.Well film photographed. I could not find anything wrong with it. See my first review!
