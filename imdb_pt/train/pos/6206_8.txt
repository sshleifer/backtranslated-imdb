I'm an admirer of Hal Hartley's films, especially "Henry Fool" from 1997. "Fay Grim" is a continuation of this film, and has a similar style and sense of humor. The plot, however, is completely different. Fay Grim (brilliantly portrayed by the iconic Parker Posey) attempts to locate the missing husband's notebooks and finds himself in conspiracy and espionage. The supporting cast (most of the people in the first film, like Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and welcome to Elina Lowensohn) are excellent and the film has many surprises. The director claims that this is part of a "Star Wars" trilogy, serving as the "Empire Strikes Back" series. If this is true, I can not wait to see the third installment! I just hope I do not have to wait another 10 years for this.
