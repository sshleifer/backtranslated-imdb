Yeah, Giorgio, it's a good movie. A bit of romance, good music, beautiful scenery, comedy, (a great food fight), and a taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of Sim, Giorgio. Any movie fan would love this movie. Those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little escape from time to time, and how to do it better than with a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? A must see!
