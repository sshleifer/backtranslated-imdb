I have to say, Seventeen & Missing is a lot better than I expected. The perception I took of the previews was that it would just be monotonous, but I was pleasantly surprised by this amazing mystery. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie, a mother who insists on her daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), not attending the so-called graduation party on a night of the week, but Lori ignores the wishes of her mother and party for the party anyway. When Lori does not get home, Emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to get visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance. Seventeen and Lack is better than so many other TV movies of this kind, as it is not so predictable. Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie, and most of it is believable. This original film LMN debuted last night. 10/10
