Belushi at her most insinuating point and Courtney Cox before Friends take a small role. I often think that Belushi is underutilized in Hollywood and this movie role is one of his best. For those of you watching your TV show, this is a very different and enjoyable character. The film itself is not earth-destroying, nor is the message new, but rather sweet and captivating. The supporting cast of familiar faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, although Lovitz's sobbing can be tiresome, and Michael Caine's charming spiritual guide has a somewhat sinister if not well-meaning advantage. Hamilton, as Belushi's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and wonders why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo is lost and not very convincing in the "prom queen" who escaped. However, a good way to spend two hours.
