Without a doubt, this movie has to be one of the biggest ........ in film history. I have seen it many times to remember, and each time it's like I'm watching the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> Where to begin? <br /> <br /> The Meena Kumari central. The performance is undoubtedly one of the best of his career, followed closely by Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam and Phool Aur Pathar. Every move and nuance of her performance, makes any other Bollywood heroine pale in importance. His masterful interpretation of Kathak, along with his grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of Urdhu, is as if nothing was seen on the Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; photography, sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene, are so charged with symbolism and meaning that the spectator is out of breath. <br /> <br /> Naushad music is unsurpassed, his knowledge of the music of the Gharan courtesan is incredible, and the way he punctuates the narrative with somber atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable. <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone who really enjoys the spectacle of total cinema should be to watch this epic mediation in life and art.
