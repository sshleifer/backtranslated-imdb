A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides lets fans see their work on the move. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspire and affect their work. Although, I was glad that the film covered most of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I feel it was a bit long. The filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing the work of Goldsworthy to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.
