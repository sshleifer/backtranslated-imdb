On California Presidential Primary Day, between midnight and 1 am, spy Victor Rovner sends a message from Kuala Lumpur to the United States. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer has returned to his family and is having trouble at home with his teenage daughter Kimberly, who blames his mother Teri for putting Jack away from home. Teri and Jack decide to have a serious talk with Kim and find out that the girl ran away home. While trying to solve his domestic problem, Jack is called to his counter-terrorist unit by his colleague Nina Myers for a meeting with his boss Richard Walsh, who reveals a threat against the life of Senator David Palmer, who is running for president, and they You must find the shooter. Later, Walsh has a private conversation with Jack and says there is a conspiracy in the agency against David Palmer, and assigns Jack to find the conspirators. When an airplane explodes over the Mojave Desert, Jack has one more issue to worry about. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising start to a hit series featuring Jack Bauer. This is the first time I watch this show and I confess that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story with multiple, realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is perfect in the role of a family man and a reliable agent in charge of three difficult missions at the same time: to find a killer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in your agency; and find his teenage daughter, who is in trouble, while trying to save her marriage. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
