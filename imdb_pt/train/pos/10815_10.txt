Now, many would think of staying away from this movie just because of the title. If you have no stomach for bloody movies then what are you doing reading this review? Anyway, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with that movie right away. This film is filled with wonderful blood, and the other usual ingredients that make up a movie b add up to an incredible viewing experience! If you are a lover of good quality experiences, then please watch this great movie!
