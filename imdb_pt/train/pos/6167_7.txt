"Long Long Journey" is a well-crafted film, a good filming and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is a mess of subplots and quirky characters that becomes a kind of Jack of all plots and no one's master. In addition, the Western public will probably find the esoteric of the obscure Parsee culture a little too much to get their arms in at 1.7 hours. Recommended for those with interest in India.
