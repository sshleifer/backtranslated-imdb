I saw his movie in Dallas, Texas, when it was released in 1986. I remember them giving out prizes for coming to see the movie. After watching the movie I can see why. The movie was not bad, nor was it great. The problem with this movie was that he tried to tell a parallel story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to wrap it around the Masters Saga. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of Robotech Masters attacking Earth. They even used the same scenes from the Master Saga, but with different dialogues. As a kid, I loved the movie. But unfortunately I have not seen this as an adult and I can not give a better review. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would love to see the film and reevaluate my position on it. That said, will someone please release this movie for the whole world to judge? I love Robotech and can not wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
