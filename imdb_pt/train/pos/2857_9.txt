As part of our vocabulary of the late 50's, we knew Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, etc. well. In that great show "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> He came on Saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set. This was a real show that portrays the values ​​of the family. There may have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that united them all. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was the patriarch of the family. His words represented wisdom. Many a time we imagined that Ben Cartwright, a widower, was to be the best of the husbands for that poor wife who had died. He created wonderful children. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all wonder why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts made a lot of money when he left. His career never took off as he was associated as a son of Cartwright. He should have tried to get back into the series. He certainly missed a bargain for giving up.
