Tom had the desire to make movies for a long time and he did. it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn notebook full of great ideas that he has filled and carried for ten years. no character transformations, no Hollywood ingredients, just life and a bit of magic. the balance, the speed, the strangeness in comedy versus drama is perfectly pondered. This movie takes you on a journey that ends before you realize how good it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. the fact that this movie is about nothing, just a sequence of sketches of people who are mostly linked through a party of one of the characters, makes it very enjoyable and surprisingly entertaining, it is brilliant because it is empty. between the lines is happening. see or not see, this is the?
