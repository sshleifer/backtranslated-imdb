The good thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect someone else's life without you ever knowing. It's a small world and this little movie shows us. The Bad Thing: There are many characters and it's hard to tell who the main character is, but it's still a great movie. <br /> It's a great movie and a lot of people compare Magnolia that I have not seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Unclassified --- I would rate the PG -13 for brief violence, some linguistic and sexual situations.
