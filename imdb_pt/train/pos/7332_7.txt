I had seen snippets of this as a child, but while I was buying Blue Underground immediately due to being a Limited Edition, it was only now that I fit it into my viewing timeline - and this is mainly because Bakshi's American POP (1981) late night Italian TV (see my review of the movie below)! Anyway, I found the film to be an epic of animation with lots of magic and witchcraft, with scenarios of especially impressive appearance (the somewhat awkward rotoscoped characters were admittedly less) with a stimulating if Derivative Point . The plot, again, was not exactly original, but proved undeniably to engage in a juvenile level and the well-developed main characters - especially interesting is the villain Nekron of the Ice Lords and the enigmatic Darkwolf warrior; the hero and the heroine, however, are insipid stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta describe the girl as well endowed (her bra can be torn off at any second) and half-naked (her tiny panties are forever disappearing her butt )! Still, it is clearly an action-oriented piece and certainly meets this front (which involves Darkwolf being particularly savage); the final confrontation, though brief, is also well treated and sees our pterodactyl-clad heroes assaulting the den of villains inside a cave. In the long run, in addition to the Frazetta scenarios mentioned above, the main appeal of this film for me now is its nostalgia factor, since it transported me back to my childhood days by watching not just movies like CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982), but also animated TV series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (1983-85). <br /> As for the accompanying creation of the "Fire and Ice" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: vintage featurette in the witchcraft animation film that is available only through the faded VHS copy of property by Ralph Bakshi himself! He goes into detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several examples of live action performances (in a studio) of segments of the script - which would then be plotted, mixed in the background and filmed. Still, having watched a number of behind-the-scenes episodes about the art of animation (in the Disney and Looney Tunes sets, for example), it's not a very attractive piece ...
