This movie has a special way of telling the story, at first I found it kinda weird when it jumped in time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was simple but still very real and moving. You met someone the first time, fell completely in love, but eventually separated and fostered a mortal agony. Who has not gone through that? but we will never forget that kind of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would say that I'm a bit touched, since two actors showed a great performance in showing the love between the characters. I just wish the story could be a happy ending.
