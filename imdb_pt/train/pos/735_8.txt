Wonderful cult film of 1979, in which Vince Lombardi High School students are confronted with a new dictatorial director named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music hater and blames students' musical tastes for their transgressions. Leading the charge against her is the entertaining Riff Randell (PJ Soles), the # 1 Ramones fan who, more than anything, wants the rock band to record their songs. <br /> <br /> Now this is an impossible movie to resist. First of all, the soundtrack is amazing, with songs from artists like Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, plus the endless mix of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena is a punk rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just a few of them. Then the cast really gives it all, with Soles an ideal choice for the role of Riff; she is a real delight. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are sincere as Tom and Kate, Woronov is well off against the likes of disgusting and disdainful Togar, Clint Howard has one of his best parts as an entrepreneur occupying the Eaglebauer laundries, and New World goers like Dick Miller. Paul Bartel (particularly entertaining as music teacher Mr. McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as ever. And, of course, it's a pleasure to see the Ramones touching themselves. <br /> <br /> The film has true spirit. The energy level is high, with author and director of co-history, Allan Arkush, bringing a great deal of talent to the process. There is also a great sense of humor. The paper airplane gag is a great example of this. This extends to the "clear" style of scene transitions. There are even hilarious giant mice created by the upcoming makeup effects, notables Rob Bottin, in one of their first shows. <br /> <br /> A movie as good as challenging authority, defending yourself-right-to-party take. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is simply a wonderful cult movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
