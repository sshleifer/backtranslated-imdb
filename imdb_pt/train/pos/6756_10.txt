Otto Preminger, completing a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, gathered his tracks from "Laura" to this hard detective drama. Dana Andrews again portrays a police officer, but this time he is hardened, cynical and was charged with police brutality by his superior - "You do not hate hoods, you liked beating them!". Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises the criminals, as his own father was a bandit. He does not want to be "Sandy Dixon's son," so he became a cop, but his methods are harsh and hated. <br /> <br /> One night, investigating a murder, he unknowingly punches a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) is so difficult that he kills him. A shaken Dixon does his best to cover up, with the intention of framing a hated thug, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the blame lies on Paine's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, model department store Morgan Taylor (Tierney), is estranged from her husband, but continues to be involved in their schemes. Paine had slapped the woman, infuriating his father, who appeared in his son-in-law's apartment, but only when Dixon left with his body. No better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Riddled with guilt, Mark falls in love with Morgan and offers money to a lawyer. He decides to take Scalise anyway, but leaves a letter to be delivered to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything. In the end, he can not live with the knowledge with what he did, and he allows the letter to be read by his superior and by Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes his love for Mark and will wait for him. <br /> <br /> It was great to find this movie on DVD after so many years of obscurity on television. Eddie Mueller, the movie historian noir, makes the comment and does a good job, but I think his claim that the audience would not have realized the significance of the cast of the two nominations, since "Laura" had been made six years earlier. In that regard, he is mistaken because he appeared in "The Iron Curtain" two years before the WTSE and the film was a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney looked wonderful together, and Ruth Donnelly is tremendous comic relief as the owner of Martha's restaurant, spreading the flames between the detective and the lady. <br /> <br /> The city's landscapes give the film an air of threat. Gary Merrill is great as the low-life Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon's father ("Your father liked me," he insults Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville Brand are also great. And Tom Tully is just touching and funny as the pop unfairly accused of Morgan. <br /> <br /> A watchable fi lm movie with a fantastic cast.
