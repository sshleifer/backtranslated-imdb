This movie is exciting, daring and the music is very good. The movie Moonwalker was made to coincide with the album Bad (1987). I have Bad. It's excellent (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson performing "Man In The Mirror" on stage. So it shows a Michael story, from his early days in Jackson 5 to the Bad era. Oh, and Badder is good too (Badder is a music video parody of Bad's single clip). So show the Speed ​​Demon video. Music and video are very, very good indeed. Even for leaving me in peace that appears later. Then he shows the movie Moonwalker. After a few minutes, he plays gentle criminal in a club called club 30. Like when he does the lean.anyway, good to see you.bye bye.
