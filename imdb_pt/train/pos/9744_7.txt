"Yes, Georgio" is a cheerful and enjoyable film / comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie that I enjoyed seeing more than once. Some critics have suggested that if anyone wished to enjoy Pavarotti, they would probably be better served by getting an opera DVD. Although a full opera may be a better representation of Pavarotti's operatic talents, an opera often requires fantasies and has lines of history that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his spoken voice and exhibit a personality and character in a way that an opera would not do. <br /> <br /> Many critics seemed to find the story unbelievable; I do not agree. Extremely talented people can be self-centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people. Also, people who are very different from each other often get perceptions about themselves and grow in positive ways, interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relation to each other. <br /> <br /> Relax and let yourself take to a visually and auditively rewarding film with Pavarotti at the height of his vocal abilities. The final scenes of Puccini's Turandot are only worth to get there.
