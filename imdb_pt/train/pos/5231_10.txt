to communicate in the film essential things of life - like what is life, has a meaning? - it's completely impossible. Of course the possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in each film (story), but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness. This happens if the input of the senses cancel out the "entrance" of our mind, ie our thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky is one of them. His "Stalker" shows images of existence, communicates life as it shows itself and still escapes his mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff do the same.
