The latest WWE PPV of 2006 proved to be a hit among fans, but for a single reason, the ladder game that was scheduled to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick vs. William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent crap of PPV being December Breakup, WWE knew they had to do something to get the fans to talk again, this proved to be helpful when they introduced MNM and The Hardy Boyz into the mix and announced that the match would be a game. brutal and one of the best ladder fights I've ever seen, but the face of Joey Mercury was a total mess. Johnny Nitro did not even check on his partner, they just kept on as if nothing had happened, and Taylor and Regal did nothing during the match, except those hit with a few shots on the ladder. In the end, London and Kendrick kept the titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere in the show, Kane defeated MVP in a decent hell game when he set fire to MVP's stupid costume. Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the WWE Cruiserweight title in a solid effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total mess, King Booker joined Finlay to see John Cena and Batista. The action was of poor quality and no one cared who Batista chose for his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall Results: Kane defeated MVP in a hellish fight. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick retained the WWE Play team titles against The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal in a ladder match. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero to keep the American title in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to hold the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman defeated The Miz in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker defeated Kennedy in one last match. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista defeated King Booker and Finlay in an abysmal match.
