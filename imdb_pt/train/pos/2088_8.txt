From the top shelf of great classic books, comes this masterful story written by Pearl Buck. The book as the movie is called "The Good Earth". It tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a simple Chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the "Great House" where he took a slave woman named O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning, she begins to adapt to her goodness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. Over the next few years, O-Lan proves her worth, firmly sharing her husband's work, problems and fortune changes. Over the years, they have raised a family and observed their simple domestic time, both partying and hunger. In fact, it is at the lowest point of their lives that each discovers the value of fellowship, loyalty, and love. As time goes by, her growing family is aided and threatened by friends and relatives, like her uncle (Walter Connolly), who is a scoundrel and charlatan, but is sympathetically tolerated. Wang has his "Old Father" (Charley Grapewin) to advise him and remind him of the fragile and fickle nature of life. Two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are Keye Luke, who plays Wang's eldest son and Phillip Ahn, who plays a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
