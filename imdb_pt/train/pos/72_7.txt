I recently watched this 1954 film, starring Vincent Price for the first time in Turner Classic Movies. Price portrays Don Gallico, a magician / inventor who is driven to kill when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, portrayed in a brief role by the lovely Eva Gabor). Although Price is a killer, I really saw myself rooting for him, he's a nice character who's driven crazy by the greedy people around him who continue to take advantage of him. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not do it I do not have the "horror" factor of some of its most famous roles (like my favorite, "House of Wax"), however, it has enough to keep the interested viewers. <br /> <br /> This is a must for fans of Vincent Price.
