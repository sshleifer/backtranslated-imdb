This may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching novel with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating consequences on the career and life of any unfortunate individual who does not have this vital skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who acquaints herself with a coworker in her factory work, an illiterate cafeteria worker named Stanley. Iris finds out that Stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. Of course, as you can predict, the two, while initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for each other ... Jane Fonda plays Iris, a woman with her own problems, dealing with a job without prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), one unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro is naturally brilliant in his captivating portrayal of the clever and resourceful but illiterate, Stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that demands respect. They are not your typical young yuppie charming, as usually portrayed in on-screen novels, but an ordinary working class, a middle-aged couple with incredible fights. <br /> <br /> I will not give the ending. though, but it is a charming and comforting novel and a personal look at the troublesome issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.
