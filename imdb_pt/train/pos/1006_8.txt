Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel, Starship Troopers, has been involved in recent years, in everything from the 1997 film by Paul Verhoeven to a TV series, to a series of games. But none of these, so to speak, really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are generally not related, the TV series was more of a spin-off, and the less said about the Verhoeven movie, the better. Little is known, however, that in Japan, a lively adaptation had been made, launched in the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite their differences, this animated six-part series is, in terms of plot, the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic. <br /> <br /> The most obvious is that the series is the presence of the electric armor exoskeletons, something of which we were deprived in the film of Verhoeven. Like the book, the series focuses more on characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, although we see a good deal of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the plot of the book is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic involvement, but it's just a bit more touched than in the book. While some might believe that dialogue and character interaction are a bit inferior to the book (it gets a little bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it's far superior to the movie. Heinlein's political views are merely extirpated, unlike the film, where they are reversed. The great reward of the series, however, is Klendathu's climactic battle between soldiers and insects / aliens, which features the kind of action armor suits we would have seen in a film version. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I liked this series because I wanted to see a closer view of Heinlein's. And I think they got along really well with it. If you can find this series, take a look.
