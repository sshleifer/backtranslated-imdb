Set in the Age of the Prague World Depression, this is the story of an ambitious attendant who is falling in love with a mysterious woman with whom he exchanged romantic letters only to discover that the mysterious woman is none other than the seller of her shop. , who seems to be constantly struggling with his colleague. Add a little twist (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee - Stewart - is having an affair with the owner's wife), leaving Stewart briefly 'fired', along with the admission that the salesperson 'liked' Stewart the time the end is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although VERY dated (references to poverty and - I have a wife and two children to consider - they are used in excess, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure such as a musical box of cigars, are out of reach for the pleasure of ordinary people), this film is far more effective (and more credible) than the 1990s re-make "You've Got Mail." In the re-make of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the real chances of the chain of events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended. "Shop Around The Corner" is an innocent Stroke by memory at a time and place less complicated, less hectic and more romantic known as a novelist's Utopia. Lovers of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this image!
