I remember this movie from when I was a small child, I loved it then and I still do now. I was able to record it on DVD for my 18th birthday and I was very happy because I found it so difficult to find it previously and had only been rented when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The movie is full of fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the voices of the characters are perfect. This movie has always been a tearjerker to me, but I think if I had not seen the movie when I was little, then I would not find it as bright and fascinating as I do, although I still believe that I still like it because I'm really in animated films.
