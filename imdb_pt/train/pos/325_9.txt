This is a great film - especially when compared to the sometimes tiresome fervor of politically current filmmakers. A film that can easily combine sex, gender, politics and art is a rarity nowadays. While the optimistic optimism of the 1960s can not be recaptured, I think we can at least learn a lesson from the film's energy and charm. I do not know what those who label the "boring" movie were watching - there are so many things packed that it never gets the same movie for more than 15 minutes at a time.
