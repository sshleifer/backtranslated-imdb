Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not only with Debra Winger's feelings, but with a childhood secret that left them in conflict with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal touches (the fire brigade that act like a Greek chorus singing), but there is also humor, intelligence and romance. The soundtrack is great too. And similar to the way American Werewolf in London used all the Wolf songs they could get - but with fire and I think I'll never forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), defining his own trailer as a rock 'She's a Lady' Invaluable ~;) <br /> <br /> Best line missing in the quote section btw ~ 'Once you had a clown, you will never come back' <br /> <br /> I love it movie (I just asked for the US DVD) and if the comments written by the kind of person who would be happier with Legally Blond 3 do not put him at risk ~ try :)
