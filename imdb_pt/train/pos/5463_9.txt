Very smooth, a lot of Pre-Hays code, and still very cheeky. I recommend watching this movie, even if you are not a Stynwyck fan. She's funny, she's sexy, she works hard - and she loves the role she has! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a prostitute that stands in the world, perfectly portrayed by a bench building. John Wayne (Suit!) Makes one of his first achievements. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a disappointment, but the sets, the lines, the clothes add up to a movie about how to climb vertically in the horizontal position.
