A good Shirely Short Temple. Child actors shouting their lines seemed to be the norm for this day and time. Perhaps being "seen and not heard" needed to be compensated. Besides, this is fun. Given the age of the films, there are certain aspects of the thing, from the social point of view, that seem to me both progressive and liberal. I'm not going to get into those here, I'd rather not ruin everything for you, but let yourself see for yourself and see if you can identify those elements. As soon as it was easy to see, from this short, the fascination that was already developing for the Temple. This is worth seeing if you are a fan of Temple. For others, it's a cool way to kill ten minutes while waiting for your good glass of milk to warm up on the stove.
