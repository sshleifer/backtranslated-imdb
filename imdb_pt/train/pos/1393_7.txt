Probably the most capricious part of the first season, 'Shore Leave' has its ups and downs; some parts drag on for a long time and others are cut unambiguously, but there is no denying that they have thrown everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to make this episode fun. Kirk and the crew seem to have found the perfect planet to get ashore after a long service shift has left everyone on board needing rest, relaxation and so on. It seems, for all intents and purposes, to be an uninhabited land, with beautiful landscapes and an ideal climate. The first indication that things might be a little wrong is when McCoy, leading an advanced team, sees Alice (from Wonderland) following a large white rabbit wearing a vest. Kirk smiles and finds the others reporting equally bizarre events and encounters. The only thing they all have in common is that each member of staff was thinking about the person / place / thing they discovered just before they found out. This does not happen immediately with Kirk or with anyone else. More strangeness follows, including sightings of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a WW2 fighter plane, etc .; Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful old girlfriend (of course) and a bully from her time at the Academy, Finnegan. The chase / fight scene with Finnegan lasts a long time, but at the same time, McCoy is executed with a spear by a horseman on horseback and apparently dead. Finally, an elderly man appears and explains what is happening. The planet is a futuristic "amusement park", where visitors have only to imagine something for it to appear. Nothing is permanent; McCoy is not really dead. When this is explained, Kirk decides to ask permission for everyone, after all. Despite the end of 'everything was a dream', 'Shore Leave' stands out as another first-episode episode of the first season of Star Trek.
