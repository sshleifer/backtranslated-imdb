Mary Pickford ("Fourth of July", as Angela Moore) is "The Little American" (of the French heritage); she falls in love with Jack Holt (as Karl Von Austreim), who moved to America with her German father and American mother. French-American Raymond Hatton (as Destiny Earl Jules of the "Fighting Destins") fell in love with Pickford. The trio of love triangles would end in France, with the Great War (World War I, in retrospect) considerably complicating their lives. A particularly entertaining movie, though propagandistic and flawed, by Cecil B. DeMille. The torpedoing and sinking of a ship carrying Pickford is of the "Titanic" type. The intrigue of war becomes dramatic when Pickford slowly becomes a secret spy of France, while the Germans occupy their ancestral home. Of course, the German lover Holt arrives. It was hard to believe they took so long to recognize each other as he moved into rape, but it was dark; and, previous events made them believe each other dead. The film surpasses the top in its symbolism. Pickford was, by the way, Canadian - though few could deny that she was not a "little American" for all intents and purposes. <br /> <br /> Fun to identify "extras" that later became big stars. Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially, expect Novarro to exhibit "star" quality during one of the film's most memorable sequences: Pickford and the wounded soldier greet each other when he is taken by her on a stretcher. Novarro even gets Mary Pickford to write a letter to him; obviously he has a future in pictures. Also linked to the future is Ben Alexander, who plays the boy "Bobby"; he becomes a dependable child actor and grows to become a partner of Jack Webb in "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> The little American (7/12/17) Cecil B.
