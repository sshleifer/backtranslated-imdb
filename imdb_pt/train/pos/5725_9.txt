This is what I wrote to some friends earlier: HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is, honest to God, one of the scariest movies I've ever seen! I'm getting very soft in my old age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A ** job! (I can not wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared sitting in the dark theater and wished I had someone, someone sitting next to me (except the protagonist in Grudge. ) I swear, there were a lot of jumping scenes that were NOT expected! I felt foolish, but my nerves did not care! I was on the edge of the whole movie, from the opening credits, and the song was fantastically scary. I keep thinking about that sound, though, and I DO NOT LIKE it! <br /> <br /> I really choked out loud a few times, and I screamed, "oh" in a scene !! Oh yes, I even covered my eyes a few times! Word to the wise, though: I thought some of the scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated the Event Horizon and thought that whoever wrote it was sick and psychotic, but I do not remember the movie so I can not compare. <br /> <br /> I can not say that I "enjoyed" this movie b / c I was terrified, but it was very good and scary. The final scene too ... whoa! As a 32-year-old mother, I think I may have nightmares about this movie, especially because of that sound. Please, get out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In summary, this is not a slasher movie like I grew up with (Jason, Freddy). This is a scary movie most of the time. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two great trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
