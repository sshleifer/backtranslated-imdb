Anarchy and the absence of law reign supreme in the rotten hamlet of Elk Hills. The town's elders replace Aaron, a tough and cautious veteran of Vietnam (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance of Kris Kristofferson) and several of his veterinary colleagues to clean the place. The plan will sour when Aaron and his ruthless companions decide to take Elk Hills after getting rid of all the bad elements. It's up to Aaron's benign and good brother Ben (kindly played by Jan-Michael Vincent) to finish him off before things get out of hand. Writer / Director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage creates a contemporary Western winner: he skillfully creates a brave, meaningless tone, keeps the rhythm vigorous and tireless everywhere, and enacts the abundant action scenes with considerable muscular ease (the exciting explosive climax is especially strong and stimulating). The front-line cast of B's ​​family faces is an important asset: Principal Victoria as Ben's sweet sweet girlfriend Linda, the fabulous Bernadette Peters as the Little Dee saloon singer Brad Dexter as the irresponsible mayor David Doyle as a bank slippery chairman, Andrew Stevens as affable gas station commissioner, John Carpenter as one of Nam's veterans, Anthony Carbone as casino manager, John Steadman as an old diner owner, Paul Gleason as an intimidating strong arm shakedown, and Dick Miller as an untalented pianist. Moral: Do not hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cronjager's slippery cinematography, Gerald Fried's cheerful and harmonious bluegrass track, and abundant raw violence add up even more to the total and despicable fun of this unfairly neglected small donation.
