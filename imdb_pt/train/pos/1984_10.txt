One of the best musicals made, which is timeless and worth seeing over and over again. Delicious! The performance, especially by Ron Moody as Fagin, is superb. Costumes are exquisite ... even the miserable ones. <br /> <br /> The two boys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderfully talented. Oliver Reed does a great job portraying Bill Sykes where you can not help but hope he gets to a terrible end ... what he does. <br /> <br /> Dance is cleverly choreographed and mesmerizing. Oliver can keep up with names like My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A movie for the whole family.
