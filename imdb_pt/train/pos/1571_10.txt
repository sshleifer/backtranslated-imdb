Since Spongebob Squarepants I have not seen a bigger cartoon on TV. The colors are great, the voices could not be better, the characters are so original, great cartoons. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. I hope the DVD of the season will be released soon !!! I love cartoons like this and I hope more people tune in to this great cartoon. It is very difficult to find the DVD of the season, so if someone finds a store that is selling, please let me know. The only Catscratch merchandise available at Nick's store is a great lookin 'shirt, but very very very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; and who is not? you'll love the Catscratch too!
