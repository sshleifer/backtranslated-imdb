Aileen Gonsalves, my girlfriend, is in this movie playing a secretary on the bench of the main character. She has a lovely scene with Roshan Seth in a restaurant. There is more information on his website at> Having stated my personal interest in the film, I have to say that I think it is a beautiful film - touching, funny and beautifully filmed.
