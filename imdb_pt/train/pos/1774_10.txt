Having hit the sitcom world with 'Father Ted', the upcoming creation of Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan was a forgotten gem for the BBC called 'Hippies'. Although created by the duo, the six scripts were written only by Arthur Matthews. <br /> Located in London in 1969 - Ray Purbs, a hippie, is the editor of an anarchist magazine. His friends are his apartmentmate, the very laid back and smoking Alex cannabis, his 'girlfriend' is Jill feminist and Hugo not very bright. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was superb as Ray, but he is superb. in everything he's in. This comedy had a 'Citizen Smith' feel about it. Ray was very much like Wolfie Smith, trying to beat society but failing miserably. Finally this sitcom will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and it was still repeated on terrestrial television - my memories are not very good from the sitcom, I still remember two episodes very clearly, the first is the opener 'Protesting Hippies', which I thought was a great start - where Ray makes a protest against the sandpaper and the other episode was 'Hippy Dippy Hippies', which I think was episode 4, again a clear reminder of the Police. Unfortunately, the sitcom had a negative reaction from the viewers (I can not think why). The BBC commissioned another series, but Arthur Matthews decided against it because of the negative reaction. Oh, well, I can not wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies - Series 1, episode 4.
