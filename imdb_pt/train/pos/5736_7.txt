Dumland focuses on the life of a (American?) Family ... The father; a violent and obscene person who likes to fart and use profanity and who has no redemptive qualities. The mother; who seems to be a paranoid psychotic, never talks much. The son; a small and boring, repetitive and annoying. The animation is simple and rough, but includes the stories and the characters. The episodes were originally only available on davidlynch.com, but have now been released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the DVD and a brief synopsis follows: 1. The Neighbor: We find the neighbor and we discover three things about him ... he has a very cool shed, he only has one arm and likes to do naughty things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- The Mat: We have discovered that the wife has an affinity for exercise, but the husband does not really think it's a good idea. In the end, the exercise treadmill is victorious. <br /> <br /> 3. The doctor: The father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire ... the medical examination is quite complete (if not unconventional), but the diagnosis is "you are perfectly normal" (but we knew it). <br /> <br /> 4. Friends visits: After a fight with the new clothes, a friend comes to visit (Believe it or not, he has one! but once we find him, we can understand why), there is surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5. Stick with the stick: We find another neighbor, he has a stick stuck in his mouth (although we never find out how she got there). Unfortunately, removing the bat from the neighbor's mouth turns out to be more difficult (and more violent) than expected ... but he is victorious in the end ... Jesus some people can be ungrateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6- My Teeth Are Bleeding: This was my favorite episode ... and it was also the most tediously repetitive and boring (hmm, what does that say about me ??). I do not know why his son's teeth started to bleed, but believe me when I say it was minimal to the plot of the story. That is an oxymoron, since the story had no plot. But it had a funny ending (involving a fly) !! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob's wife, we have the distinct feeling that Dumbland's gene pool is very shallow. . Uncle Bob is a sick guy (I will not elaborate, so I will not ruin everything for you). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wears the pants on her family ... and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of his broad fist (and spends the rest of the tour curled up in a tree in the yard). <br /> <8- Ants: After the house infiltrates ants, and an erroneous attempt to blow them up goes wrong ... it ends up spraying on the face with the spray and starts to hallucinate. The ants put on a fabulous show of music and dance ... he goes crazy trying to kill them, ends up in a full body plaster ... and let's just say, the ants take revenge in the end. <br /> <br /> No matter how bad these stories are, there was something that made me want to watch them. They give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe they were a way out for him, to get rid of some of his violent thoughts? I really laughed out loud at many points of the episodes. Many aspects are absurdly funny !!
