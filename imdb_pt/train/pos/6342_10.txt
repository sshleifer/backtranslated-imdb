In one word - excellent. This is the movie. Go and see. Director Ron Howard ... I mean, director Ron Howard did a fantastic job, as he always does. An incredible attention to detail, vivid colors and decorations, breathtaking atmosphere of Whoville, amazing assortment of costumes. Wait, there's more to it - the story is very good, too.

The dog is cool. All in all, it's a high quality Christmas fairy tale. If you like fairytales, it's for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Read some other reviews here ...
