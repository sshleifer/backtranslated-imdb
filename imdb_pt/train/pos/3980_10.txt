I've been watching this every night on VH1 last week. This is a fantastic picture about the drug epidemic and how the drugs were shown in the media during the late 60s and 70s. Woodstock, Easy Rider, The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix and Joplin are all here. Vh1 formed a complete and intricate picture of life and times during the "drug years." From the San Francisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this documentary shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business and death and new life that blew into American culture. From marijuana to LSD to cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were entering the country, the hippie movement, conservative resistance, and how drugs affected the arts (music, movies, etc.). Introducing tons of fascinating interviews and filming of News. <br /> <br /> Drug Films: A Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights
