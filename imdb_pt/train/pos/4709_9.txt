Okay, I'll confess. This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do. He makes a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney, with charm to spare. <br /> <br /> The support cast are all solid workers, and will take a step forward and do a good job in this 80's comedy. A parody of the Gangsters films of the 1930s and '40s, he constantly innovates, with remarkably original material. (Well, yes - some of them have been copied since - but when this movie was made, it was original, and much of it was not copied elsewhere). Watch Joe Piscopo warn people not to do ______, with one of the big taglines for fakes. Watch Roman Moronie do things with English swearing that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh. Watch incredible jokes such as the owner of an animal store, Johnny Kelly, using the price tag on their kittens and dusting their kittens. Watch the biggest educational "warning against sex" movie ever made. Watch the most incredible misrepresentation of the church's Latin, while a guy who never took a store gang assembles a Thompson machine gun. Look at the lines you'll use in casual conversations for the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton make the perfect antithesis for the working mother with surprise jokes that you'll never see coming. <br /> <br /> If you see a gag that does not hit your funny bone, be patient - another one will come in 30 seconds or less, and the odds are, you'll need to pause until you've finished rolling on the floor several times. Duckies and rabbits? They also. Pay attention to the subtle material - some of the jokes of the vision may go unnoticed in the first few exhibitions. <br /> <br /> There are some minor flaws - but it's probably the best of spoofs. Some come close, but none of them are that good.
