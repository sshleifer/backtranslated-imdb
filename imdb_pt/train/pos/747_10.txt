Although I was born in the year that this movie came out and I had never heard of it until my first year of high school (1996) when I saw it I was totally entertained laughing and crying and feeling along with the characters because me and my friends it was them. <br /> <br /> Hair, clothes and speech were out of date, but the emotions and despair of every situation were so familiar! I remember thinking how real it was and how I wished they would still make movies like that. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this movie the night I was at a crazy party (not unlike that at Jay's house) that had been destroyed by what we considered the losers who went on the sidelines of our multitude. A world-class BS'er and kind of "responsible" mother immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also the person with a car) even though I had some of Madge's insecurities floating around as well. My best friend was a Deidre and her good friend from childhood was our Annie. <br /> <br /> Attending the scene where Jeanie is at school or the one where she and her boyfriend are gone and then she is telling Madge how much she loved him as conversations and situations that I personally had. <br /> <br /> Now, at the age of 27, I recently saw the movie again and felt a surge of emotions, because it was like watching back a piece of my own youth (though none of my friends died). I think this is a must see for all girls over 13 years.
