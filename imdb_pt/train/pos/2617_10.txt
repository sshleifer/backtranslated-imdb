I watched King Lion more times than all my friends struggled. Have a little sister ... you know how it is. So far I have memorized the plot and the lines. After Lion King 2 came out I was like okay ok, let me see ... the second was significantly weaker ... so I saw an ad for lion king 1 and a half ... I was like okay there we go again . After watching the 1 1/2 I was like wow. All my expectations (for repeatability) were broken. A truly adorable and original storyline keeps you glued to your seat all the time. I have noticed that the drawing has been filled with so many comic moments that ROFlmao will apply here 100%. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend watching the cartoon.
