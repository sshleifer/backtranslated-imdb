Illudere (to deceive) comes from the Latin verb 'ludere' (to play with), so you are warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel (yet elaborate and intelligent) activity derived from a complex and story-like absurd and idle staff, whatever it is; and yet I am fascinated by the mechanism of betrayal and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; then, many years ago, I was able to finish the book, it was a revelation! At first I was so bored were it not for the amazing style of writing (I actually started LOVE LE Carre after that novel). The main character is not hesitating: he made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or not? After this novel, you can clearly understand the more somber version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana', written by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no more game, it ends in tragedy or in a comic and grotesque way, or both. There is no Smiley here to sustain decent human qualities in "service," or at least there is no reason to present it in this case. The BBC has done an excellent job with these series of LeCarre novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and settings; of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. Be warned, however, even if one may find you laughable, the after taste is bitter.
