Although not as wild and come out as some of Takashi Miike's later films, this is a great criminal drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a Japanese policeman with Chinese parents trying to overthrow a Chinese mafia. Complicating things is that his younger brother is acting as the villain's advocate and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than with several complications that keep things interesting and distract things from the thrust of the central narrative. It's this complication and waste of time of about an hour in the movie that makes it less than a great movie (it's very good). This is definitely worth seeing, especially if you do not mind a frantic pace. <br /> <br /> A word of warning, violence when it happens is explosive and unpleasant. There are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex. If this is not your cup of tea, proceed with caution. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
