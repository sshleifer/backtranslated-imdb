I think that's what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! Or fucking Australian? I still do not know, but what I do know is that I really enjoyed this movie, but this could not be my favorite movie! <br /> <br /> Great story with great actors but with a terrible ending ... make you cry and say 'Oh, she's so good' ... Still, who did it? What really happened? Who is that guy? No answer to those questions ... Mysterious movie with a good overall rating ... I give an 8/10, going for 8.5!
