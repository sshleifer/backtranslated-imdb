Guys and Dolls is a film eager for a remake. It was made forty-eight years ago. Its two main stars are dead or 409 pounds. Although a remake, with big stars now, was box office success, it would not be able to capture the magic that went into that version. Your unlimited energy can not be recaptured, nor the sheer joy you get when you watch something like this: a huge, widescreen entertainment movie. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (which lasted 409 pounds). the last time I heard it) plays Sky Masterson, one of New York's biggest punters. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose crappy game of "almost like he can find a speakeasy-for-it" is famous all over town. However, when the only place he left to charge him is to charge $ 1,000, Detroit needs the fast cash. He bets at $ 1,000 for Masterson that he can not take the missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana the next day. <br /> <br /> Faces and dolls are nothing more than nasty guys singing and dancing, which usually, as you do here, add fun. It's obvious to see how this was a Broadway musical: there were not so many sets, and the scenes were long. If I were to complain about one thing, it's like the songs were unlike. Sometimes there were two songs in one scene; other times, thirty minutes passed without one. Guys and dolls is never boring, just a great time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Not classified.
