I saw this merry little movie on 10/11 in 1979 when it was aired on CBS. I did not know it had been in a theater. To rate it from a childish point of view, I would give 4 out of 5 stars, because being a boy at the time, it seemed a little "girl". <br /> <br /> The climatic scene in which Gazooks tickles everyone's daylight was a bit disturbing at the time, but you get over that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I re-discovered a Blockbuster video in 1995, I had to revisit it! I still liked it, despite the fact that it seemed a bit "old". I do not know where the other reviewer here got the idea that he was not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's out there. It may even be on DVD now, at least I hope it is. I want to share with my kids someday! 10 stars here, it's still a great kid's movie. (final) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: I finally found a copy on VHS !! Woo-hoo!
