This is one of the most adorable episodes in the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialogues and fun characters to break the tension of some scary moments. There's the usual blonde "vampire" dancer (what's up with Serling's predilection for this kind of character, so that she keeps popping up in several episodes?) And various other characters, but it's Jack Elam's "old man" who totally steals the show. . I consider this the light-hearted version of "The Monsters Are Losers on Maple Street" - or perhaps a 20-minute parody of The Thing's Twilight Zone. On another note: I thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things - he looked familiar - but it seems that "Ron Kipling" disappeared after only two TV credits in his name.
