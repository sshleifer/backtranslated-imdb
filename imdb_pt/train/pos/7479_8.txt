"The sweet is never so sweet without the sour." This quote was essentially the theme of the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who has received everything in his life. He takes things for granted and comes in full swing in this great movie with a superb touch. This movie will keep you involved in the plot and unable to take a break to take a break in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that really makes you back down and look at your life and how you live it. You can not really enjoy the best things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced evil (the sour). The theme will really make you "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the film gets very distorted in the points and is difficult to understand. I think the ending is perfect. I recommend that you watch and see for yourself.
