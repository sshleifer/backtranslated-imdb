This was fun to watch, spookily atmospheric and the effects were very good considering they were in the middle of World War II. The plot unfolded very quickly at the end, with the villains receiving their punishment. It must have been a good place to watch at the local flea market in 1940 when they were facing the greatest threat to their freedom from the Nazis - well done with a rather serious message about the dangers to Great Britain -Britney of third-party columnists. <br /> <br /> But Arthur Askey was so annoying and boring that you just wanted him to shut up - well, at least I did! I suppose different tastes at different times, but the clowning around has become tiresome. If he was playing a boring little man as part of the script, he succeeded. <br /> <br /> A good clock and quite short in little more than 80 minutes - a good background for older children too, so they have an idea that train travel in austere times was like; uncomfortable slow, dirty trains, being thrown off for no reason, surly staff ....
