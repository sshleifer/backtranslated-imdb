The Man, Snowy River II, does not reinvent the wheel, but it's a beautiful movie that appeals to crowds and plays great notes. <br /> <br /> For those fans who want the elements that made the original movie Man Of Snowy River hit, (breathtaking scenery, sweeping score, sweet romanticism and crack action) this movie really delivers. This story begins a few years after the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) was removed by putting his fortune on a litter of stock horses. He returns to pick up where he left off with his beloved and well-mannered Jessica (played by the divine Australian lady Sigrid Thornton) who is still trying to get out of his creation at the feathered cattle station (Harrison is now played by American Brian Dennehy). Jim's leading role and character that shakes the plot is high-class, successful snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie), who is eyeing Jessica. Add to the mix some social tension around the real estate and stallion with a bad attitude from the first movie and that's the plot. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is acting. Tom Burlinson fits perfectly into the wide-brimmed hat and Jim's laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton is a lovely heroine and both get real chemistry on screen. Stuffing Kirk Douglas's solid shoes would never be easy and Brian Dennehy steps and screams, but he never feels very authentic in this part. <br /> <br /> The music is extensive and exuberant and the cinematography can be a roller coaster of a tour of Victoria. There are moments, however, that seem very self-indulgent as the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the pilots to show how beautiful the landscape is without some personal human drama. A little more sand would have been enough here, we are from Aussie, we can catch it !! There are some very JAWSish moments with the stallion that defy belief. However, the funny thing about this movie is that among some glaring cliches, there are some really creative and touching scenes. Jim putting the saddle on the stallion (VERY Whisperish Horse ahead of time) Jim and Jessica setting up at home, the fabulous scene in which Jim shows Alistair riding with his faithful whip. I can see why this character is an icon. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very nice sequence. I hope everyone involved wants to make another one. the man from the snowy river III: The CRAIGS. I'm sure we'd all like to see how Jim and Jessica are doing on their farm. <br /> <br /> The Australian DVD has some extra scenes. It's worth it if you're already a fan.
