This film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action image with a lot of black humor as well. This was one of the biggest hits of 1993. This is one of Harlin's best films. Lithgow is a great entertainment villain. Stallone certainly made a brief return of this sharp thriller. This is probably Harlin's best work as a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The DVD has anchored (2.35: 1) widescreen anamorphic transfer and fantastic Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.
