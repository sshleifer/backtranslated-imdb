A long time ago I wanted to see this movie, being a fan of Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through this reformed role. Thank God for the Turner Classic, which aired last week. I can imagine that there were a lot of problems with the kids after the war, especially with the way things were in the 50's. Some of the boys are a little scary. I certainly would not want to meet them on a well-lit street, let alone in a dark one. There were some good insights about the feelings of a firebug too, or as they call it, a firefly.
