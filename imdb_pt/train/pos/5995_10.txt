I'm not sure if it was right or wrong but I read through the other reviews before watching the short.I have to say that I do not agree with most of the negative comments or problems that people have had with it. <br /> <br /> For the first time director / producer of "Lone Wolf," I like to see things that I can aspire to, not necessarily from professionals, but from people who get wet like me. <br /> <br /> If indeed it is also a first-time sailor, as I read, I applaud the effort. So much work, then, about that! There were some comments on the song. I thought it was very good for the piece. Some said it kind of droned over a while, but I found it created tension without (us) necessarily being aware of it, and when he pulled the gun and the guitar began to play chords, it was as if we knew there was a train on the rails, but we realized that it is now moving. Yes, there is a 180 degree slide / clip, but it does. Has anyone else seen Hugh's dirty shirt go white (near the end, in the rain) in "Australia"? See how much money and people were behind this movie! Give the boy time for God's sake! All in all, I think it was very well done. Only two things I would have mentioned are hardly worthy of mention - do not walk up to a shiny brass frame with the camera, and I would have only displayed the splatter at the beginning for an outlet, so people do not necessarily know what it is. <br /> <br /> My experience so far has taught me that it's not that it's hard to make a movie, it takes time to learn how to do it, so it's time to do it, and then you'd better take a little longer to think of all the details you need to have filmed before calling "post-production time". IMHO, it looks like director / writer Ryan Jafri did his homework, and if this is your first newsletter, I'd give you an "A". The rest of you report to the board office for a whuppin '.
