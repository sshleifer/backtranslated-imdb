Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth and there is nothing revolutionary about it. But it's still great - a ferocious Duke of Wellington and a fool and fat Dr. Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series one of the most reckoned. There are still more funny stories to be featured in this series, and that brings humor into a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. The third exit from Blackadder is not the most famous and well-known, but the role of Rowan Atkinson as a butler of a stupid prince is funny and effective, and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Very good! 9/10
