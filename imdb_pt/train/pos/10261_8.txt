In the first place, this should not be a brilliant and thought-provoking film, as so many other critics seem to liken it to. The first review says something along the lines of those who enjoy it knows nothing about horror movies, apparently it's the other way around. If someone looked back after the movie, it really should not be convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But really that was all he wanted, it was to blow up viewers with a huge shock value (and all flaws were visuals much less noticeable in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave this a high score because it achieved its goal and even though it was not absolutely horrible (in the non-shocking sense), it made me a bit sick and completely paranoid / pessimistic (I did not do this ). I do not trust anyone for about a week, because I did not want to wake up tied up and tortured)
