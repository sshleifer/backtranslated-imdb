A case of being in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating movie. It's easy to see why Ch√°vez is so popular with his people. He does things. It is affordable. And it's also easy to see why the West hates you so much. He controls the resources of his country and returns the profits to the people. Especially the poor. And it's easy to see how TV stations can portray misleading images to put the case on. Just like the Iraq war or the war on terror. Or those who are missing weapons of mass destruction. Or how about the axis of evil. People need to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop the new cons who rule the world. Go watch this movie with an open mind. And make your own mind. So I suggest you see Aaron Russo: America: Freedom to Fascism. It is not the people of America that is the problem. It's the government.
