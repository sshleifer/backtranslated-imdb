In the days of Shrek (the movie) and Pixar (the studio), this is a much more traditional animated film. He gathered some characters that would not normally be seen together (not to mention, try to save a human baby and bring him back to his father). They start out as enemies and end up as best friends. If this sounds like a Disney movie, it is (only done through 20th Century Fox). The trailer for the movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, but the film does not live up to the expectations of the trailer. The problem is that the creators of the film did not decide who the movie's target audience is. Yes, there are some jokes in the movie that only adults will understand, but the film is primarily aimed at children. Parents will like the fact that for 90 min. the attention of their children is focused on something other than them. The backgrounds are excellent and the voice is good, but this is nothing more than a good movie. Kids will love this movie, adults will just enjoy it.
