Greetings again from the darkness. Long awaited, the distorted comedy of screenwriter and director Richard Shepard is a launch party for actor Pierce Brosnan. This guy, Bond left. This new guy is something else altogether !! I read that Shepard thought Brosnan was the handsome boy for this plum paper, but Brosnan proves to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and it's anything but beautiful! Do not underestimate how humor is distorted in this. If you go, expect to see phrases and jokes about all sorts of sex, murder, religion, sports, business, and anything else you may deem politically incorrect. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his wonderful facial gestures and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is the direct guy in Brosnan's comics and has a lot of depth and comedic timing to get this partnership clicked. Hope Davis has a small but subtly effective supporting role, such as Kinnear's wife (which bears her name "Bean"?) Which gets a little lively when she has a facilitator in her living room. <br /> <br /> Visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, racetrack and suburban Denver. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit off center and you like making risky movies, it may be for you.
