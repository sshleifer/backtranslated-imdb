In my humble opinion, this film did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near me here in Provo, Utah, in Sundance. I like most of his work, and that was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people did not like that. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it appeared on the big screen. She gave it to me to read after we had seen the movie together. The movie and the book reached an emotional spot in my heart, and I was crying for several days after watching the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to keep our loved ones from getting hurt. We see this in our own family relationships, but our love and our families and their stories endure through generations. Cinematography was perfect and breathtaking - I was struck by its beauty and how it gave life to the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean, "But when I am alone in the mid-light of the canyon, the whole existence seems to fade to a be with my soul and memories.And the sounds of the Big Black Foot River, and a four-count rhythm, and the hope that a fish will rise.Anything eventually merges into one, and a river passes The river has gone cut by the great flood of the world and runs on rocks from the hold of time On some of the rocks there are eternal raindrops Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs I am haunted by the waters "These words, taken from the book and spoken at the end of the film (by Robert Redford, who narrates as Norman Maclean), are basically scriptures, in my opinion. Any possible flaws the film may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of history and cinematography. It was beautiful!
