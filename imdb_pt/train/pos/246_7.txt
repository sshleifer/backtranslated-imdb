How could I miss the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I could not and so, I rented this mess from a movie. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of Ned Kelly and was amazed at what I found out about this young man's legend. I was also surprised by how mediocre this movie was. Maybe the fact that it was too late, and at the end of a 4-hour movie marathon, or maybe it was a bit slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom were able to create interesting dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I detest to recommend this as a must see, it's a great story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, this is very rare and should be enjoyed) and the movie has some good sequences of actions. <br /> <br /> 6/10 see for historical value .... (yes, right ... and that is the only reason to see this ...;))
