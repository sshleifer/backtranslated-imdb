<br /> <br /> Therefore, not being a poet, I can not convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. Goldsworthy's effortless movement, in shaping the beauty of nature in his own work, is captivating. Watch him stuffing reeds together in a web hanging from a nearby tree for a few minutes while he talks about his work, and then receives the reward when the camera cuts off the general outlet. Surprise yourself with the ease with which it operates, and then notice the futility when a light breeze overturns the whole web. <br /> <br /> Goldsworthy's genius apparently knows no boundaries, for its inspiration is nature itself. It is in the essential change of nature that your work, though complete in its own sphere, becomes complete.
