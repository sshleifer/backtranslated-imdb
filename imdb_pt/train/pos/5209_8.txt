I saw this important intense movie tonight. It's the most important and best work of Richard Gere and Claire's Dane. Gere deserves an Oscar for his fine portrayal of a man being forced to retire prematurely as a sex offender registry administrator. Claire Danes is fascinating as the Gere woman chooses to replace him - a woman he tries to teach all he can while investigating a last case where Gere's character is convinced that one of the ones he is in charge of monitoring may be holding a young woman as a hostage. The subject is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this movie will not be forgotten soon. I know I will be haunted by Gere's portrait for a long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins portrayed a serial killer who has a terrified picture on the screen and involved me. The movie opens with a shocking statistic, so do not miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. Richard Gere's best role, proving that man can act. The Danes can also do it extraordinarily well in this often challenging film. <br /> <br /> This is a brave film and Gere gives a deep performance in several layers. Just give him the Oscar now ... he deserves it!
