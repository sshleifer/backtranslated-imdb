I could see this movie in a preview and I was blown away by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I do not remember laughing so much about a movie and getting excited about it. Laughter is not a joke here - it's observations, laughter of recognition, little shocks of "Oh my God, I thought I was the only one who felt like this!" I'm not going to give the plot, which is more than just "Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend." The whole family is part of the relationship here. Probably the best mix of laughter and warmth from "While You Were Sleeping." <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much deeper than before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is incredible, a list of veteran theater actors that I loved in other roles, but they blend to make a compelling family. Dianne Wiest is adorable as her mother, Juliette Binoche is bright and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), And even the grumpy Dane Cook makes a warm, quiet and touching presentation. The soundtrack of Sondre Lerche is a wonderful addition, and I'll buy the CD in the second that is available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this one.
