This short was nominated for an Oscar and I wish it had expired! Basically a jam session shot between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the song is amazing! Hollywood has often embraced the Jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but this is a rare look at the movie in a jam improvisation. This has been added to the Preservation and Deservedly list. TCM administers this as a fulfillment periodically and performs it every March at some point for its "31 Days of the Oscar" tribute. From the center of the city to the bell, nothing but a net and the shot is so soft that the net barely moved. More solidly and highly recommended !!!
