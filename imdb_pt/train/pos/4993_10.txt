Unfortunately, this movie has been unavailable for a long time (as other posters have noted), but this is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and touching love drama set in a favela. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, who are just about the best of their careers, and is an example of how director Frank Borzage was able to create an almost fairy-tale aura around elements of poverty, crime and terrible social iniquity, which only proves how truly romantic and spiritual were his talents. This film shows how love survives in misery and desperate need, and is totally affirmation of life. This is a true masterpiece of the period, and is a film that deserves to be more widely known.
