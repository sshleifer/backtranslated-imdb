From what the critics and the public pointed out, the BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big fat clinker. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent it out last night. It proved to be very worth watching. Of course, it's not your basic American comedy, and it does not take a genius to realize it's a very British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change from all the other movies around, a breath of fresh air. Of course, there were some holes in the plot, but overall it worked. First, Kidman was fabulous again in a very different role, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy. She just keeps proving she's one of Hollywood's greatest talents. Not only her Russian accent when she speaks English is effective, but there are times when she talks a lot in Russian, and if you did not know it was Nicole Kidman, you would never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford should have taken note in "K-19". Overall, a small movie that works despite the awful noise.
