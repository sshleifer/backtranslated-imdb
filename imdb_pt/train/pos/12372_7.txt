The Sentinel is a film recommended to me years ago by my father, and I've seen him many times since. He always manages to entertain me, being effectively scary too. The flashback scenes are what really did it to me. Cristina Raines's father running from one side to the other, shivering with the two scary women, can always send chills down my spine. is your typical good against evil, but at least it can be fun. The ending I consider to be one of the best in Horror history. There are many shocks and suspense, seeing Burgess Meredith doing what he calls Chazen, put me on the edge of my seat. The Sentinel has the perfect strain buildup. We are never totally comfortable whenever Allison is on the screen. We know that something terrible is always waiting for her, and that made things even more tense. This movie is often overlooked among horror fans, but I personally think it is one of the best of all, and certainly has enough for all Horror fans to be satisfied. Presentations. Cristina Raines has her moments of wood, but came mostly much of the time. She is beautiful to behold, and her chemistry with Saranadon seemed natural. Chris Sarandon is great as the boyfriend, Michael. He had a presence on the instant screen, and I could not help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jose Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable roles or little cameos. Burgess Meredith is great as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we find is absolutely terrifying. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken do well, like the clumsy detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has a scary scene, which I will not ruin. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. The Sentinel is an effective horror movie that horror fans, unfortunately, tend to overlook. It will give you the emotions and scares you need to be satisfied. Worth a look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
