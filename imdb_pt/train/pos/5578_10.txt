A hilarious and insightful perspective of the dating world is portrayed in this first-class comedy with writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds when the four male protagonists meet weekly at the local restaurant to check out their dating problems. We met Brad: a good-looking playboy, a wall playboy, a quick-witted playboy, and a sharp tongue; Zeek: a sensitive and cynical writer; Jonathan: a sexually perplexed guy with an affinity for creams and masturbation; and Eric: the married guy who cherishes his weekly encounters with his single friends in the hope of some enlightenment to his married and boring existence. The rehearsals and tribulations of single-man lives in New York are playfully voiced, mirroring that of Sex in the City and HBO's new comedy, The Mind of Married Man, and bring a shrewd light to the scams. The story takes a turn when the three singletons meet Mia - played by Amanda Peet - and everyone falls in love with her. She seduces everyone with her incredible ability to adapt to the personalities they exhibit. When they realize that everyone has met and fallen in love with the same woman, they have chosen her because of their friendship. Whipped is a realistic portrait of the world of dating, which the critic failed to recognize. In simple language, they missed the point. The protagonist is here caricatures of real people. The exaggerations are hysterical, mixing satire and humility, and should not be taken as seriously as the critic's discredit suggests. Watch this movie, you'll laugh from start to finish.
