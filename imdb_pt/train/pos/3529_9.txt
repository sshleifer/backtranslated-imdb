Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unfairly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. The night he was murdered, he went out with a mysterious woman who refused to give him her name. After being accused of the murder, the police visited all the places that had been with her, but the people only remember him being alone. He is condemned to die and his secretary (Ella Raines) goes off in search of the murderer because she loves him. <br /> <br /> This was made as a Universal B movie (see cast - all character actors and one star - Franchot Tone - in decline). The budget was small and the cast almost unknown but what came out was one of the best noirs films of the 1940s. It is beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by William Irish (a pseudonym of Cornell Woolrich ). It moves quickly and looks fantastic. And there's the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr., who has just come off the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised the censors have not). <br /> <br /> There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect. Tom gives a terrible performance. He looks ghastly and is simply awful. Also Curtis is hard and bland like Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves you - he's so unemotional. But Raines is very good at the leading role. She is beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene when the killer is behind her never rings true. He is hardly a physical threat and his reactions seem exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Still, I'm giving a 9. A great movie - flaws aside.
