I have not seen this movie, but I must. Having read all three books by Thor Heyerdahl (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I am actively looking for a copy of this film. <br /> <br /> The thesis that the Peruvians migrated to Polynesia is alive and well. Considering that this crew had no GPS, and only an old-fashioned valve radio (tube) with a 6-watt output, his trip was heroic to say the least. <br /> <br /> Please respond to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in buying it.
