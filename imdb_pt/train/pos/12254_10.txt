I saw this movie after watching the Paltrow version. I found it a very good one, and I thought this would not be so good ... but I was wrong: British version was much better and enjoyable! I found Jeremy Northam more "nice" than Mark Strong, but I can tell that Strong gets a lot better at Austen's Knightley. Either way, both versions are good, but anyone who loves Austen's books should watch this movie. I agree with * quote *: Andrew Davies has changed some things but still remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
