Mine, Kasi Lemmings is certainly a good-looking woman. This movie is a lost jewel, a "documentary" of the early 1990s satire, when MC Hammer had just begun to fade on that good night. We follow the three NWH members as they embark on their picaresque journey of supposed riches and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, in the end, they end their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and a lot less naive. This is one of the best movies that anyone has ever heard of, but it's the kind of movie you love or hate, much like "Company Man" in this regard. I consider this movie as the 1000 islands of the state of New York: it's a wonderful little secret that you want to keep for yourself.
