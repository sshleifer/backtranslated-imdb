Lost is an extremely well made TV series about some people who are lost on an island. There are so many twists and turns that you can not really decide who your favorite character is, one minute is he, so he does something, so he's the coolest, so she's about to do something, so she's cooler than the suspense to burst the episode ends and its like noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait a whole week also see the next episode, but it's worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humor, has everything but topless girls, but that's fine because it means you can really focus on history more and history is what it's all about. So if you like a good story and like suspense, this is a good one, however, I think it's probably better. (I have a review on this too that you could check it out.) I would give a good 8 out of 10 mainly because it is so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
