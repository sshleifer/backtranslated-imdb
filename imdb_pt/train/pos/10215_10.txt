Most people who pursue films with Audrey Tautou do not seem to understand that Amelie was a character - not really the real-life personality of Audrey Tautou, so every movie she participates will not be Amelie part 2, part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> Now, with that being said, I also got this movie simply because Audrey was in it. Yes, it is true, there is a big gap after the first scene where she is not seen for 45 minutes, but I did not even miss her because I was having a lot of fun with the other characters. The guy who lies about everything is very funny, the guy who justifies people who run out of their coffee and jump into the account finding coupons and such that they balance the loss, in fact ... entering all the characters here could take a Good time, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou's character Irene is not the exaggerated sugary girl that Amelie was. In fact, like Irene, her indelicacy toward a homeless person asking for change caught me off guard at first. In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but over the course of a day (very horrible), her disposition becomes increasingly bitter and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and constructions ... very fun to watch, great landscapes and scenes, very colorful and never too slow, and all the characters can really act. The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes remaining ... that's when all the plots begin to merge and the ride really catches up and everything comes together and makes sense, and the whole butterfly effect blooms. I swear, it was the best 20 minutes of film I've seen in a long time, and the end ... It made me think "damn, I really was lucky enough to find this movie." The end of this movie is top notch. Who wrote the script for this is brilliant, because not only are all these other subplots happening, but somehow they all make them together (and in a sensible way, which is the case here), but also to make each character human and alive, not just an old person used as a crutch to build all that butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I highly suggest this movie that is a great movie to watch anytime, in any mood, with any company or alone.
