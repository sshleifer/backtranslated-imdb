I watched The Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse's 'Drive-in Cult Classics' (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it's a really good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of history in a short time. You have hippies, rock, motorcyclists, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The leading actors do a reliable job. And, I found the plot intricately woven to be believable and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the support cast, especially motorcyclists, offers a blistering performance, particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words. Maybe they used real bikers instead of actors. Some characters, in particular, were exceptionally believable. <br /> <br /> The musical score is absolutely perfect, for the times, the time and for advancing the story. I found the music a real treat. I noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the song "The Food", I researched them on Google; but he could not find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey who wrote, produced and starred in this film liked the idea so much (from a disobedient married man brought to redemption through trials and and a little help - of course - that he wrote, produced and starred in "Weekend with the Babysitter."
