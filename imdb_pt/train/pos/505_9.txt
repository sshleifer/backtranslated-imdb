A good start. I was a bit surprised to find that the machinery was not so advanced: it should have been more rude, to match what we saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, although Mrs. Vulkan seems a little too human. She needs a school in Spock that, after all, is the model for this race. Too bad they could not have picked Jeri Ryan. I like Miss. Park, the Korean lady. The doctor has possibilities. I did not solve the other males except the black guy. He's very nice. Bakula needs to find his niche - In QL, his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything. He is, of course, big and strong enough for heroism. The heavy ones were fine, although I did not like their makeup.
