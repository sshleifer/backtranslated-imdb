I saw this back in the early 90's on UK TV, I liked that, but missed the chance to record it, many years passed, but the film always stayed with me and I gave up hope of watching it TV again, the main that stayed with me was the end, the part of the castle of the hole really touched me, it is easy to watch, has a great story, good music, the list goes on, it is good I say how good, but everyone goes take it there The best bits of distance with them, once they have seen, yes the animation is high-level and beautiful to watch, it shows its age in some parts, but now it has become part of beauty, I am so happy that came out on DVD as it is one of my top 10 films of all time. Buy it or rent it just watch it, best view is at night alone with drink and food within reach so you do not have to stop the movie. <br /> <br />
