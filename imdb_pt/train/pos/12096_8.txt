I've watched this movie several times and found it very good. This film is also known as "Castle Of Terror", "Coffin Of Terror" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele, it's your beautiful, scary custom. George Riviere, the male leader, does a good job with his role. The whole movie is full of atmosphere, and there's a lot of tension everywhere. Camera angles are good and acting, for the most part, is not bad. This movie is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have the DVDless version, which is much higher than the edited version of the TV. Get some popcorn, turn off the lights, relax and enjoy. John R. Tracy
