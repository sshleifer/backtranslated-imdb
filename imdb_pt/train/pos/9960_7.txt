I noticed that this movie was being destroyed well before it hit the theaters and I also had no high hopes for it. I realized that it was another kind of "You Are Served" movie with some cool dance moves and a horrible performance. I was in the theater and deciding between this and Meet the Spartans and chose this. To my surprise, the acting was not bad and the film was really good. The fact that it has a lower rating than what you have served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the rubbish posted here I recommend going see a matinee view of this movie so you do not spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised at how wrong everyone has been about this. When it comes to dance films, this is certainly one of the best performing far superior than many of the others. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. I hope the rating will increase after it's released on DVD and more people check out the movie instead of judging it based on the comments before the movie's release. <br /> <br /> The movie is approaching its correct rating. More than 1000 people gave the rating of 9, a bit too high, but at least it's helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1.
