I loved this movie I'm Mexican and I was less offended by it. Actually, I think this movie should be screened at police headquarters throughout Mexico. It is a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a corpse of three months. It irritates me to read in the news as murderers, hijackers and other slaves set free by paying a laughable fine or living like kings inside the prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. A bodyguard became a vindictive watcher. Kidnapping is booming industry here (at least in big cities). I really wish the real life kidnappers would suffer the same fate as Creasy. That would be so wonderful (Sorry, I'm resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is an exciting movie that you can not miss. It may be difficult for some of you, if you are not accustomed to reading subtitles (Mexicans do this all the time while watching American movies), but the effort will be worth it. Some of the issues are a bit confusing ... like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The film starts a little slow, but the pace increases frantically in the second half. I swear you'll be cheering while watching Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll enjoy it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films of the year. A "must own" for a DVD collection! 9 out of 10
