First of all, let me tell you that Rob Roy is one of the best films of the '90s. It was an incredible achievement for everyone involved, especially the performance of Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves. But unfortunately ... <br /> <br /> constantly, and unfairly is compared to "Braveheart." These are two completely different films, probably just similar in the fact that both are about Scots in historical Scotland. However, this comparison often bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy". I really like "Braveheart", but the idea of ​​comparing it to "Rob Roy" is a bit insulting to me. Simply put, I love "Braveheart", but it's a pale shadow of how much I love "Rob Roy". Here are my particular reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real person. . He is a legend, a martyr, a figure greater than life. Because of this depiction, he is also a perfect person, never doing anything wrong, and basically showing his fellow Scotsmen to the promised land. When he finally fails, it's not his fault. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the people he trusted most. He even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants so much freedom. <br /> <br /> Wallace's portrayal is very well done and effective. But that does not really inspire or intrigue me. I find human ambiguity far more fascinating than human perfection. That's why "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better movie than "King of Kings," and that's also one reason why I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart." Rob Roy can be heroic and brave but he is far from perfect. He makes several mistakes that have affected the lives of many of his loved ones. Now, of course, not to have false pretenses against the Duke of Argyll was an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of selfishness and egocentrism. Let us not forget that the relatives he claimed to be protecting were homeless until the end of the film because of this act. But Rob did the best he could, and that was all you could ask him. <br /> <br /> Rob's wife, Mary, is also a normal and ambitious person. Let's start with what she looks like in this movie. Of course, she is beautiful, but she does not wear makeup and basically allows her natural beauty to appear. Compare this to the two loves (or one, depending on your point of view) by William Wallace in "Braveheart." Now these two ladies are hot, but they hardly point out how women looked at the time (especially the laymen). It may not be a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Roy's attempts at accuracy are far more effective. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie "Rob Roy", Mary has to live with her rape by the cowardly bat, Cunningham. . She feels compelled to tell Rob about her fight, but not because she knows that Rob must take revenge on her rape. Such revenge would surely mean Rob's death, and Mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The villains in "Rob Roy" are equally compelling. Although the enemies in "Braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce, a brave and cowardly man, is plagued by moral decisions that are all familiar in the fictional world. Should he take his claim as King of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace to ensure the safety of his family name? Bruce is the most ambitious character of "Braveheart", but from Brutus in "Julius Ceasar" to Fredo in "The Godfather Part II", these types of characters are not original. Longshanks, while a compelling villain by himself, is very one-dimensional. He is the evil epidemic, and his tyrannical ways contrast directly with Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" has three villains who are wonderful in their cunning. First of all, let's start with Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so obsessed with his self-image that he is willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it. "Make sure I'm not ridiculed" are his favorite words for his "factor". He is a man obsessed with power, annoyed by a man of noble grandeur as the Duke of Argyll is considered of greater providence than he. He is shamefully obsessed and insecure. He is an aristocrat of evil, but in ways that make him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are the conspirators of "Rob Roy," and are also Roy's direct assailants. Callarn is so clever in his cowardice that he is almost comical. He will do everything to maintain the goodwill of the Marquis, which includes betrayal and cheating. Cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been bred to do what he can to get the status and affection of the Marquis. He needs a father; little does he know that the marquis is his real father. So when the opportunity to get wealth comes from Callarn, he grabs without even questioning. He is very much like the evil of modern man, so egocentric and vain that he does not care about the consequences of his actions on others. <br /> <br /> Many criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film as an exaggeration. Hogwash, I say. Of course Cunningham is not simply evil, but also psychopathic throughout the film. In a world where a man and step-son can go around shooting random people for fun, is Cunningham an unbelievable character? We live in a society where people seem to have diminished the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this diminished value have changed. It is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow the capacity for compassion. Rob Roy and Mary give us hope that goodness will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman and his values ​​of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the Marquis. He appreciates the bravery of Rob Roy and Mary, and has a direct vexation for the Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for the people of power. Hopefully, people like the Marquis are an exception and not the rule. <br /> <br /> - The final duel in "Rob Roy" is more exciting than 10 of the battle scenes in "Braveheart". <br /> <One thing I get tired of is that people tell me that "Braveheart" is a better movie because of the battle scenes. First of all, the battle scenes are hardly original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator," Hollywood has a long tradition of historical scenes of European battles. "Braveheart" has some of the best battle scenes ever put into the movie, but they suffer from a major problem. These battle scenes have no context except for the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong, duels are hardly original. In fact, there are probably ten times as many films with duels as with battle scenes. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to behold. It's one of the biggest scenes in movie history. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First, the fighting style and behavior of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly. Cunningham is effette and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and brave. Cunningham uses a sword of fencing while Rob uses a wide sword. Cunningham struggles with fast and complicated moves, while Roy's fighting style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The whole movie, from the deliberately slow first time to the exciting second half, is leading to this moment. It's a powerful thing, and of course Rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world. When Rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively), it's one of the biggest moments in movie history. Rob wins because he has more to live and his honor is more powerful than that of Cunningham. The use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene. Good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a guy just gutted so he can shout "FREEDOM!". But hey, maybe it's just me. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I do not know that people in the aristocracy or the Scots spoke like people in "Rob Roy", but I I feel it is clearly an attempt to capture your speech patterns. I feel like a lot of people are bored with "Rob Roy" simply because they can not understand what the characters are saying. If this is the case, read some Shakesphere or put the hidden caption. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the greatest films written in the '90s. Many of the dialogues in this movie are clever, but you may have to watch the movie a few times to understand it. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the dialogue in "Braveheart" is not very interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scotsman played by an Aussie? This is a legend, and clearly there was no attempt to capture the talk of the times. This movie takes place several centuries before "Rob Roy", and yet they talk like people today. So the reason why many people like it. Today's audiences have become increasingly lazy and do not want to have the time or patience to understand complex things. So, as with many epic movies, they expect to see villains speak a recognizable English accent, while heroes speak in a vernacular not too far from our American tongue. Of course, Wallace is Scottish, but in addition to sounding like Scotty from Star Trek and some "Aye" for recognition, the Scots in this film fit the Hollywood tradition of how we believe the Scots should sound. So, do these descriptions prove that "Rob Roy" is a better movie than "Braveheart"? Difficultly. But if that proves one thing, it shows that it is little known that "Braveheart" is a better movie than "Rob Roy". For simplicity, "Rob Roy" is a film that has themes that are very timely in the world today. "Braveheart" is a movie about a legend that is inspiring, but hardly realistic. You can make a decision on what you think is best ... <br /> <br /> Grade - A score - 9
