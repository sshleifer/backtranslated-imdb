Notice! Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I saw the movie in German, so it may be, that I missed some clues. <br /> <br /> Despite some weakness in the plot, it's a movie that came to me. I especially liked the performance of Lexa Doig. Sometimes I get the impression that she is Camille. But I can not stop thinking about what happened at the end with Bob, Cassie and baby. I believe, she, after initially being put on Bob, eventually loved him and regret what happened to her brother and be forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it's a little strange, that she would carry her baby and love him. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I do not like those endings. Dean Cain was as good as ever, Eric Roberts .. well, I saw him better, but also worse. <br /> <br /> I believe the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is, I liked it a lot.
