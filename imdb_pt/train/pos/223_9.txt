in one of Neil Simon's best pieces. Starring and sullen ex-Vaudeville played by Walter Matthau and George Burns are joining for a TV comedy special. The problem is they have not even seen each other in over a decade. Filled with a zippy a liners and inside showbiz jokes, this story flies along with a steady stream of humor. Good work also from Richard Benjamin as a hurried nephew, Rosetta LeNoire as a nurse and Howard Hesseman as a TV commercial director. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Trivia note: The opening assembly contains footage from the 1929 Hollywood Revue and features Marie Dressler, Bessie Love, Polly Moran, Cliff Edwards, Charles King, Gus Edwards and the Brox Sisters.
