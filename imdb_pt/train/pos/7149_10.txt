Holes is a wonderful movie to watch. He has good messages, such as: be a good friend, never give up, etc. I recommend it to anyone. I still say that the book is better than the movie, but the film gives the book a chance. In addition, Khleo Thomas plays Zero. This really contributes to this !!!! I laughed a lot!!!
