This hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny on its own terms and very funny too, too.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Boy, they're bad too! One is given to pinup poses and spicy comments where e'er she goes. The other stood up to look like Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual lips and slightly apart. And to reveal nothing, she is even worse than the other. <br /> <br /> All three sisters are played by stars. The man who stumbles in their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had something of a career. <br /> <br /> This looks like possibly the first mainstream soft-core porn ever marketed. Well, of course not the first, but the busiest at the time. <br /> <br /> The girls use as little as possible and let's not forget the members of the female audience: Bromfield is shown with an electric shaver - was that it? - naked chest. He is also shown soaked in a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> There is also a real plot: the girls' family, you see, is cursed. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic deaths that can be made to look like suicide. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad. I really do not know where it was shown. Maybe it was made for drive-ins. Somehow, and I may be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the main target here. The women are sparsely dressed. They often resemble covers from magazines such as Police Detective or cheap novelty jackets. <br /> <br /> But the guy seems to be the central focus. Not everyone in the movie likes him, but all the girls love him. And I think the audience is also destined. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun - and on your own terms too.
