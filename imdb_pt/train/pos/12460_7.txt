Farewell friend also known as Adieu L'Ami / honor among thieves is not perfect, but it is a pure and entertaining thriller that sees Algerian War veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson dismounted trapped in the same basement safe, one to return stolen titles, the another to clear the two million salaries that were on the Christmas weekend. Of course, things are not that simple, even after opening the safe, leading to some twists and turns. On the debit side, there's a very bizarre striptease scene in a parking lot, Bronson has a very annoying slogan like Fonzie, he uses at the most inopportune moments, Brigitte Fossey, sporting perhaps the most hideous hairstyle of the 60's. wig is blown back the top of his head by a strong wind), is something of a responsibility ?? "I'm going to learn how to make love well! I'm going to read Shakespeare!" Is speech hysterical in all the wrong ways ?? and it's a shame about the horrible last line / shot, but on the other hand it's a surprisingly fun and unpretentious number that's worth checking out if you can find a decent copy. The UK Cinema Club DVD only offers the English soundtrack, but since Delon voices and the rest of the cast are reasonably well dubbed this is not a big problem, especially since the widescreen transfer is very good quality.
