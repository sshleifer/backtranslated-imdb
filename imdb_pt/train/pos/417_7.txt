This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Jane Calamity, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the villain who sells weapons to the Indians and you can barely recognize him. This was the first time Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie made was basically the same, but set at a different time. This film begins with the assassination of Lincoln and also deals with an indigenous war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill is married and now wants to stay at home. This movie also deals with Custer's last position and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and I usually do not like Jean Arthur, but I liked her here.
