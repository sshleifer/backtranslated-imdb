This is a good family show with a great cast of actors. It's been a good break from the reality show lately. There's nothing more like this on television right now, unless you tell Joan of Arcadia to be similar because you also have a teenage character. Anyway, the Clubhouse is worth it because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of kindness and ingenuity that is attractive without being overly sweet and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms complete the rest of the cast members, and each one is fantastic in his role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister, Betsy; she's a pill, but she still cares about her mother and her brother, even if she hates to show it. It may take a few episodes to actually find your legs, but the Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come in for a good time, so check out people - you'll be glad you did!
