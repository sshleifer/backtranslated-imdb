My main problem with the movie is that it continues for a long time. After that, it's very good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a maid who marries Muni. They live with Muni's father on a farm and are doing very badly. When he finally gets some money to buy some more land, a drought hits and nothing is growing. Everyone star to the north, Muni stays behind in the beginning. When they leave and come to the city, they discover that they are not jobs and are worse off than before. They even think of selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money, but they decide against it. When a group of people begins to plunder the city, the military appears and begins to execute people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won a second Oscar for this movie.
