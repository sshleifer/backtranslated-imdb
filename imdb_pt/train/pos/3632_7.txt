As predictable as a Hallmark card, but not without merit, The Rookie takes a solid ride. Dennis Quaid, the most sensible actor these days, is absolutely perfect when the science teacher turned out to be baseball player Jimmy Morris. The movie is never stupid for kids, as you would expect from a G rated movie. As a sports movie, The Rookie is one of the best I've seen since Any Given Sunday.
