The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that has become something like The Bible or the story of Hamlet, very popular and difficult to obtain, due to its satirical content on the communist regime. It represents the drama of the intellectual man, the humanist, in a "red" world. A film full of passion, fear, sexuality, all great ingredients for a great movie recipe. One of the biggest Romanian films, despite its psychological load (after all, it's a European film).
