A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would do justice to the genius and beauty of this film? The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburger has no limits, each painting is filled with fantastically daring compositions. The change from the bold colors of the "real world" to the black and white sky is ingenious, visually showing us how vibrant life is. The final scene of the court is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the ladder to heaven to keep the court on the operation of Peter (David Niven). <br /> <br /> All the performances are on location (Roger Livesey being a highlight), and the romantic energy of the movie is beautiful, there has never been a more romantic film than this (if I have not) that). A matter of life and death is all about the power of love and how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the movie alone, the way it lights up Kim Hunter's face makes her even more beautiful, what a genius he can do simple things like a table tennis game look like exciting. And the sound design is also flawless; The way the sound changes in vital points was a decision well ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> This is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in the cinema, under appreciation in its initial release and today's audiences, but of my all-time favorites, and that is why I give this movie a 10/10, in one word - Beautiful.
