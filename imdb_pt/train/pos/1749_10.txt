Steve Carrel proves to be a major protagonist in this wonderful and unique breath of fresh air. I almost fell in love with how genially hilarious it was. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie title says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40 year old man who works in an electronics store. He's a bit nerdy who loves video games and comics, and has the biggest collection. His colleagues who work in the store with him discover that he is a virgin during a fairly filled sex poker game dialogue, and then Andy has to go through a bit funny how the hell of rude sexual arousal, but always spoil what leads him not to lose his virginity, but he ends up getting lucky in the end. <br /> <br /> Leave the little ones at home, but take the whole family to see this incredible Adult Romantic Comedy. You will be hooked and broken from the start, and when you are done, you will be wishing you to wear your thick, absorbent undergarments. Only another thing I can say is that Steve Carrel was not recognized as a man who left 20 years ago. He will definitely win the best male performance in the years to come at the MTV Movie Awards. You can bet your sweaty dollar on that, people! <br /> <br /> I give this one a perfect 10!
