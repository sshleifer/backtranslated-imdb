I first saw this movie in the theater when I was 8 years old and it still rocks me. Muppets are so cool and approach show business in an innovative and naive way. My favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit at a fancy restaurant. This is a clever and funny movie for children and parents. Viva Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the class.
