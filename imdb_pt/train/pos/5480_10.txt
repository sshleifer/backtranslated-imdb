This is a great movie, it shows what our government will do to other countries if we do not like your government. This is not as bad as what Reagan and Bush did in the first place with South America, but the United States still has no problem with other countries like this. This film also proves that the American media launches government propaganda. This is exactly what they did for Aristide in Haiti. The reason why this coup against Chavez was not successful is that Chavez was elected with more than 90 percent of the vote. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a political documentary, it would still be a great movie if it were a drama, it is incredible that this is real. The other critic is lying when he says that "Chávez takes the radio waves," the private media is doing anti-Chávez propaganda all the time.
