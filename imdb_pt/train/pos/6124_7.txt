This movie sucks as hell! I think it was written like a serious movie, but when it came time to film, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's play some humor and spice it up!" The characters are also slightly developed. Oh, and the death sequences are the best. One thing I hate, though, was the gun dryer. What was that all about?
