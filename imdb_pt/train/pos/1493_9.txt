I thought Mukhsin was wonderfully written. It's not just about entertainment. There are tons of subtle messages that I think Yasmin was trying to convey. And yes, it can be confusing for some of you (especially if you have not watched Sepet and / or Gubra for 76 times). <br /> <br /> I bet you've noticed how they use the characters from the two movies before right? It's really ironic how the characters relate. Like the bossy neighbor is this prostitute of Gubra. And the girl at the pool table ends up being the nun and the godly man's wife in the future. <br /> <br /> And I absolutely love the voice-overs. Its still awakeningly fresh raw. Like, when they took a picture of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard, then, suddenly, Mukhsin's voice was saying 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim ..' (the scene when he climbed the tree). <br /> <br /> Captured the attitude of Malaysia (and somehow gentle, laughing at how pathetic) portrayed in the character. For example, even children can be very sharp (complete with annoying voice) and simply lousy person throughout the film. And how can you be so intrigued and talk about people when life itself is not resolved. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that this movie has fully met my expectations, if not exceeded. <br /> <br /> He kept me glued to the screen, I could not even take my eyes off him. Not even to do in the movies. Haha
