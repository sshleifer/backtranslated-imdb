This movie took a lot of stick. He was criticized by critics when he left and was guilty of destroying Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I think people do not understand is that it's not to be an epic, the Oscar nominee of a movie, it's just a brilliant action "Bruck-buster" at its best. Fast cars, fast editing and great soundtrack - does exactly what it says on the tin. In addition, for those who like cars is a pure delight. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and we can not forget Eleanor! I think it would be difficult to find a better action movie and, personally, a better movie! Then again, maybe it's just me!
