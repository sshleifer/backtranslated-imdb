Paul (Jason Lee) is a failure who happens to be involved with a type A princess named Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and her daily agenda. In his bachelor party, Paul gets a little drunk and somehow ends up picking up a beautiful dancer named Becky (Julia Stiles) back to his digs. "Nothing happened," as they say, but the pair wakes up in the same bed. Suddenly, Karen telephones. She's on her way to Paul's apartment. Understandably, Paul pushes Becky out of the way, though her underpants are left behind. But, there is still more fun ahead. At a family dinner at Karen's parents' home, Paul runs back to Becky, learning that she is Karen's cousin. Talk about some explanations to do! But instead Paul chooses to fake a stomach problem and hides in the bathroom. Will Karen find out that Becky spent the night at Paul's? And what will be the consequences? I'm sorry for the critics who make movies like that. They should definitely brighten up, as this movie is new and fun. Of course it does not hurt that Lee is a consummate funny man, Stiles is a lovely beauty or that Blair is a natural and beautiful but anal bride. The rest of the cast, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is also pretty cool. The look of the film is wonderful, just like the costumes and settings of California. Best of all, the screenplay is imaginative and inspired, creating great chuckles for the audience. In short, if you want to please funny proverbs, make the movie tonight. It may not be Oscar material, but it's absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a good day.
