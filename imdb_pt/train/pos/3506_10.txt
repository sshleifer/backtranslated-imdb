Peter Sollett created an affectionate portrait of real people living in poverty on the Lower East Side of New York, or Loisaida, as is known to locals. <br /> <br /> Sollett's heart is in the right place when he examines this dysfunctional family, which is typical of the country's different "inner cities." Mr. Sollett emphasizes the positive in the story he presents. These are basically good kids, children of parents who abandoned them and whose grandmother took them under their wings. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting your characters as losers, Mr. Sollett shows a positive side that they all have. These children are not using drugs, or they are stealing because they are poor. If this story had been made by Hollywood, we would have seen a parade of stereotypes instead of children who are struggling, but deep down they are not defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was a revelation. It is natural. Then it's July Mars. Your character shows us a nonsense girl who will not be cheated or driven to do anything she does not want to do. Altagracia Guzman, as the grandmother is excellent. She conveys her frustration at not being able to direct her grandchildren to the things she believes in and that are so important to her. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a great image thanks to Peter Sollett.
