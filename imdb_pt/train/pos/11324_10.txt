I have to agree with everyone else who posted it. <br /> <br /> I watched it a while ago, but I'll tell you, whenever I hear certain songs from this anime I remember the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling that I have when I watch, and it makes me cry (a feeling so happy but sad). I, however, discover that the love story seemed a bit rushed and they did not explain things correctly, but that did not spoil any part of the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I liked this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research (and watch the ending a few more times) and I found all my answers and more. I loved how they set up historical legends to fit in this anime, it was incredible and just made me want to search a lot more (I've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime). I think it should have been a longer series, but if that's all they had to work on then they got it all right. I would recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with a great story, well built characters (some mysterious) and some fanciful action. <br /> <br /> In addition, even if this was based on an H game, there is none of it and I really prefer it (I have no problem with mature anime, in most cases I prefer)
