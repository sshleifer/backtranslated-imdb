"My Left Foot" is a very impressive film that tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who suffered from cerebral palsy and learned to paint with his left foot, the only member in his body that he controlled. Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as Best Actor for this film, which I'm not quite sure I deserved, but it's still noteworthy. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic touch and occasionally almost humorous. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's devoted mother, also won an Oscar for a believable and touching role. My problem with this movie is that it's a bit too real at times. When Brown is desperate and must help someone and do everything with his left foot, the film can be difficult to watch. This gives an often depressing feeling, which can turn off some viewers for a while. However, if you look beyond that, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those who have disadvantages and other difficulties to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still consider ourselves troubled are inspired by this movie because if something with a much worse condition than we can overcome their difficulties, we can certainly do the same thing. Well done, occasionally pleasant but difficult to watch. It may not be for everyone, but it is not bad at all. out of ****
