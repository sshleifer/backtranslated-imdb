There were a lot of things going against this movie for me before I watched it. <br /> <br /> First, I was a typical high schooler in a Shakespeare class I did not even like, let alone understood. half of it! Shakespeare would not be more than unintelligible without me pouring all my concentration on his almost-encrypted pieces ... encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language ... and then I still could not get most of it. <br /> Second, it lasted 4 hours! I never thought it could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, I really understood all the language that was being performed. Now, the script was closely followed in this film, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in Shakespeare's class. And here was my mind opening and understanding me. I was doubting myself while watching the movie almost! But behold and behold ... when accomplished, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is indeed a master, who wrote great stories. When I saw him on the big screen, especially in the high-budget film style (with beautiful photography and photography), and acted in a surprising way by Brannagh and cast, somehow ... I understood what was happening. What was being said? The language is incredible and passionate. This allows for more raw emotion ... when words can not describe something, perhaps the words of Shakespeare can. <br /> <br /> I still maintain to this day that the Fist of the North Star (animated, dubbing in English) is the biggest film ever made. No movie offers more entertainment. But for a film to come close to dethroning Fist from that position (which Hamlet did - came close) is really amazing ... inspiring. It was not a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more surprising, it made me appreciate shakespeare. Wow. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the rare TRUEY powerful movies out there. <br /> <br /> This makes 2 hundred trillion stars of infinite stars. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all of you kids, in a Shakespeare class ... forget it. You're wasting your time. You have to see the plays performed. Only then will justice be done to them.
