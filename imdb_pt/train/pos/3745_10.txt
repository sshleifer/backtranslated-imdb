Many mystery stories follow the standard path of whodunit: dirtier murder, clue collection, bunch of potential criminals, sprinkling of red herrings, and inevitable confrontation between the clever wicked and the cleverest of those who solve crimes. <br /> <br /> "Forgotten" abandons the well-trodden and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts. The fact that at the end of three episodes we do not have easy answers and no package can thwart some, but for me it was the indication of a cleverly crafted tale that probes, disturbs, and haunts the question: what does an evil person look like? <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily forgotten.
