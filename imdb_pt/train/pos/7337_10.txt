Good history and great animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and that is good. Anyone who likes Conan, the Barbarian, or the game Dungeons and Dragons, should have fun. The battle between good and evil is clear, although it may seem that sometimes our hero is neutral. Most often in fantasy films, elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and elves and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone familiar with the work of Frazetta, Bakshi or even Tolkien knows that they are not racist. Anyone who likes Fantasy movies should like this movie. Not for small children due to violence and sexual innuendo. The cast was well done and the scenes and songs are top notch. I hope someone puts this gem on DVD soon. I consider myself lucky to have a VHS copy in good condition.
