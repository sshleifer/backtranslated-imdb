I saw a special early selection of that today. I have to let you know, I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really had no expectations of getting into it. I ended up enjoying it a lot. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who is going to spend a weekend with his family. While at a bookstore, he meets the woman of his dreams, only to find out that she is his brother's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This film is very well done - the soundtrack, cinematography and acting are all top-notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem with this was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development, especially with Dane Cook's character. We never got close to seeing the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt that it might have helped a little in showing what Dan's internal conflict was like because he was in love with Dane's girlfriend. Other than that, though, Dan in real life is definitely a solid, sweet movie, definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we've received this year.
