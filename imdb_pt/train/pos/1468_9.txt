The person who wrote the review "enough of perspiration and spitting" has no idea of ​​what is cultural, literary or psycho-critical. He rejects Zizek's interpretations because they do not seem "in line" with what the director originally intended. And? The importance of the intention of a director (or author) is not important in critical theory. This is known as the "Intentional Fallacy" of the author and should be avoided. Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_fallacy A text or movie CAN be analyzed through various theories, many of which disagree with each other as well as completely ignore the author's intent. This is the most fundamental idea of ​​Critical Theory. <br /> <br /> Because of this, whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting Zizek. In fact, anyone who studies theory would immediately discredit opinion of this type (I suggest you should too) because it is completely wrong. <br /> <br /> That said ... If you are interested in Freud, Laconian, or Kristev's speech, this movie is a must. It connects these theories with popular films, making them much more palpable and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them.
