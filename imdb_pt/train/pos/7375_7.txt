Not on the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but still a good Japanese horror movie. I would like American horror producers to take a page out of the Japanese horror model and put more "strangeness" and less cheap shocks in their films. Many good examples in this, scenes where a white face is seen behind a young actress, photographs on a wall are suddenly glimpsed smiling, just for a second, and more. Worth checking if you like the genre.
