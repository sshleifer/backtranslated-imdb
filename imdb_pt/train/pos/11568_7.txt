One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that entertained American viewers during World War II, Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time," portrays a bum flea that settles in Elmer Fudd's dog. The little guy turns into a real sadist while making a home on the dog's back, but Elmer warns the dog: "Another scwatch and I'll give you a shower!" Meanwhile, the flea is riding dynamite on the dog! * And that's not the end! I noticed that in one scene, Elmer is reading a comic book with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs often co-starred, but Elmer never co-starred with Porky (unless you count the very short "Any Bonds Today?"). But for me, Elmer's thinking about these other famous characters of his genre emphasizes the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew of its existence within his universe, even if they did not appear in this cartoon. Of course, I'm probably going too far in my analysis. I'm sure that the design was conceived as pure entertainment, and certainly entertaining. As for the line "I can get to like this", it seems that this was something that the censors would not have allowed, but somehow they missed it; I, in fact, do not know exactly how it should be. Was it sexual? As for the ending, if I had thought I had seen everything, I would have been tempted to look for more, rather than do what the cat did (though it was a legal trick). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind those designs certainly had a crush on TNT, right?
