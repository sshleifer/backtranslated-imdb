I've had this movie on tape for years and I started watching it again this morning (while waiting for my clothes - that irony!) Mainly because I wanted to hear the title song of Benjamin Frankel again. I ended up sitting in the first half hour, delighted at how beautifully assured the direction, writing and performances are. The film is like who has British stars of 50's characters: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont and, particularly, Ernest Thesiger, big as the old and desiccated giant of the textile factories. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not character players as such, but charming and charismatic. This is science fiction in its purest form and fun comedy as well. A classic of all time, and I hope no one tries to redo it!
