ELVIRA, LADY OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> directed by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> starring: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> /> Plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) closes her TV show and goes to the small Christian city Fallwell, Massachusettes, to collect the inheritance of her dead aunt, hoping to make a lot of money to open a show in Las Vegas. Unfortunately for her, all she can get is a scary old house, a poodle and a magic cookbook. While in Fallwell, Elvira tries to earn money, give teenagers some life, win the heart of a stallion (Daniel Greene), avoid being burned at the stake and keep her scary uncle's cookbook (W. Morgan Sheppard), who is planning to use the book to end the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love Cassandra Peterson as much as her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman and like Elvira she is all that more morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention she has an incredible pair of knockers. In this film, its charms are well used. <br /> <br /> I loved the feeling 'fish out of water' from the movie. You have Elvira in her black low-cut dress, her big black hair and her huge 'twins,' and she's in a Christian town where most girls are not allowed to wear makeup. It also makes your love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more fun. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is equally as great as Elvira's uncle / enemy, Vincent, to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but still does not disturb and steals scenes of Elvira. <br /> <br /> What really makes the movie is not the plot, but the many jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and it makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel. I've heard that there are about 56 jokes about boobs in this movie, and any fan of horror films by Roger B Corman will love the spoofing in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you'll love this movie.
