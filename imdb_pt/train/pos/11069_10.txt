"Ah Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham," thought the average fan, expecting another Snatch / Lock Stock; Expecting maybe a couple of time changes, but none too hard for "me and the guys" to swallow after a few beers. <br /> <br /> Ah, mind you, you need to watch this movie. No cups of tea, no extra diet cokes from the counter, no shouting "keep running" while you stomp on the refrigerator - watch the movie! No laughs other than what you can do from considerable violence (and if that floats your boat, so be it), but steady and steady direction, excellent dialogue, and great acting. <br /> <br /> My favorite - Big Pussy of the Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
