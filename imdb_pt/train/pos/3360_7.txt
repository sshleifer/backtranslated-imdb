One day in May 1938, when a great rally was celebrating Hitler's visit to Rome, it served as a backdrop for a love story between Antoniette (Sophia Loren), married to the fascist (John Vernon) and Gabriel (Marcello Mastroianni ). She is a boring housewife with several children and he is an unhappy lonely homosexual, fired from the radio and persecuted by the fascists. She is left alone in her home when her wife is due to attend the historic celebration. So both develop a very nice relationship, despite their differences. The film is set in the historical meeting of Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini, along with other authorities like Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III, describing the events through a radio that is sometimes irritating. <br /> <br /> It's a romantic drama performed with sense and sensitivity. A mercilessly passionate romance between two conflicting characters. Magnificent performances by two professionals make a splendid movie worth seeing. It is clear that the sensible script of Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola is always interesting, elaborate and sentimental. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis. Emotive musical score by Armando Trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif. The film deservedly won the 1978 Golden Globes as the best foreign film. <br /> <br /> Director Scola's imagination extends to illuminate the limited scenarios where the drama is unfolding. Usually his films happen in few stages and are semi-theatrical. For example: ¨Le Bal¨ (1982) uses a French dance hall to illustrate changes in society 2) ¨Nuit de Varennes (1983) a stagecoach is the setting where one finds an unlikely group as Thomas Paine, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette who fled the revolutionary Paris 3) "The family" (1987) all happen in the grand Roman apartment of the family; and, of course, 4) A Giornata Particulare¨ or "A special day", where Loren and Mastroianni create a wonderful relationship in their respective apartments and flat roof.
