I used this movie in a religion class I was teaching. Goldfish are swimming happily in their bowl in an upstairs apartment. A boy and his mother are away from home. The boy received money to buy milk. On the way home, he stops at the carnival to play a game. Beside him is a man in a black suit looking a bit scary. The boy drops the bottle of milk. Smash. The man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk. This scene alternates with what is happening at home. A black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment. He (?) Find the aquarium and watch. The fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl. So far, a lot of teenagers in my class and I fell in love with the fish. The cat carries the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat drops the fish into the bowl. The double story line includes the man suspected of black and the suspect black cat. Both inspire prejudice. Both are innocent. It was a great beginning of discussion in my class.
