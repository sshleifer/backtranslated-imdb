Although the soundtrack is a bit dated, this story is more relevant in the US than ever before. With not just blue collar jobs, but all the jobs being outsourced by the American corporations while the government profits and the Americans suffer. <br /> Peter Strauss is Emory, a steelworker who works the same job as his father for 35 years. His wife is well portrayed by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, trying to support the family with two children when Emory loses his job. The factory is closed under the guise of mismanagement, but there is also misuse of funds and lower wages, where they can pay a metallurgist in a month (outsourcing) what they would have to pay in Strauss / Emory in one day. It does not matter that these men are all good loyal workers who have values ​​and try their best for their family. John Goodman, Gary Cole (as Strauss's brother) and a few other co-workers are also affected. . It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes between Emory and her father are moving. Emory hopes his local union can reopen the mill, as they promise to do so. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother, Lee, already sees the writing on the wall. There is no more work on the rust belt (Ohio) and they should move on. However, where in the US can they move to? Where will it be best for a blue collar steel worker? <br /> <br /> There is a triumphant scene at the end where Emory and his team fill the loading dock with steel products. The guard lets them do it as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and he has empathy. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good message movie about hard times here in America. Something few bother to face until personally affected. 8/10
