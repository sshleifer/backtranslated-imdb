Thelma Ritter stole the photo. I just watched it again. I could not help but become emotional in his final scene. She did not get the Oscar. That's why you should not trust Oscar very much. Richard Widmark never had a better part and was the perfect cast as a failed 3-D human. Jean Peters was great as the smart girl and tough in her best role of all time. And Richard Kiley must have been pretty good; Why else would I hate him like that? Yes, it was heavy on patriotism; but without it, you do not have much film. Watch their faces! The three most important stars did not need much script. I wish I had watched them make this movie without dialogue. If you've seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief", you may know what I mean. When I was a child, in 1956, on my first trip to New York, I had my Bronx Uncle take us to the foot of South Street in search of the number 66. That's when I learned that Hollywood was unreliable. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I'm not giving up most of the story because I hate it when I know what happens before I see for myself. If you have seen, no elucidation is necessary. Just maybe, someone reading these comments has not seen "Pickup On South Street". You will like; just do not go look for 66 South Street in New York.
