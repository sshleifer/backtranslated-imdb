A murder investigation goes on stage as The Vanities on their opening night plays for an unknown audience. The strange combination of musical mystery and murder is worthy of its cast, production numbers and the novelty of the film. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has the role of a malicious actress who wants to stop the marriage. among show stars Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous "Sweet Marijuana" number (which was also on a Bette Midler album). So while the chorus girls take turns behind the scenes, rogue detective Victor McLaglen scrubs the girls while trying to solve the murder of an unknown woman backstage. <br /> <br /> We quickly learned that Maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar, that wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie ) gets into everything. Many tangles writhe among the musical numbers. The most well-known song of the program is "Cocktails for Two". Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting "Where do they come from?" And there's a strange rhapsody that explodes in a number of Harlem specialty with Duke Ellington! Quite the cast. <br /> <br /> A great performance here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is very good too. Brisson is a total of zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor, and also sees if you can see Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the girls in the series.
