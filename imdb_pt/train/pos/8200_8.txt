Clint Eastwood has definitely produced better films than this, but this one does not embarrass him. Dirty Harry catches everyone's attention, and unless you want to watch the novel, there's no reason you do not like it. He's cool because he's dirty, it's great because he kills without thinking too much, it's perfect because he makes the bullet pass through his heart and a hero because he does not care. <br /> <br /> From what I've seen in movies where Eastwood plays, the lead character always captivates audiences. In the heart of White Hunter Black, he is the crazy director, in "In the Fire Line" he is the "Old" un, while here is the "almost" jobless with his work, that is, he does work for himself He does not even care about his superiors, who practically send him off on vacation. <br /> <br /> Based on a rape victim, this movie is promising to all non-nonsense moviegoers. The movie has nothing to do with the central plot. However, what makes it a bit inferior to Eastwood's best movies is that while the main character's character is captivating the plot, it's not, as it's obvious from the start. It's not a movie that will make you sit in one place without moving. In addition, there are many people much dirtier than Dirty Harry.
