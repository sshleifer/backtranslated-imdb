Recently I was looking for the newly released Wide Screen DVD from FLY AWAY HOME and found an interesting title I had never heard of: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough movie caught my eye (he responsible for such films as GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the script was authored by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "Special Edition" was full of interesting sound material and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I took a chance and bought it. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan star as Archie Gray Owl, a real life hunter in the 1930s who came to love and respect the wilderness of Canada, and worked to help protect them. Brosnan (who starred in a James Bond movie) gives a dark, warm and powerful performance, as does Annie Galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences her feelings for the creatures of the earth - especially the beaver. A beautiful score by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and a beautiful photo by Roger Pratt all contribute greatly to the film's effectiveness. And the extras on this DVD are something else! It includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real gray owl, as well as audio commentary tracks from Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; and many other great additions PLUS options for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM capabilities. GRAY OWL was released directly on DVD in the United States - a fact that Richard Attenborough attributes to Hollywood's lack of interest in distributing something that is not loaded with too much violence and sex. This is a movie that not only informs and entertains but leaves you with something to think about. I had a very warm feeling at the conclusion of the films - and a whole new love and understanding for the beavers! GRAY OWL is a very good movie - worth checking out! This is one that I look forward to sharing with others.
