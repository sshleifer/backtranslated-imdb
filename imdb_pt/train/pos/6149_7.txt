I just bought the restored version of a movie that I remember very fondly from childhood and is certainly made for the entertainment of a curious afternoon. Bedknobs definitely makes more sense in its full form, deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) link the events together very precisely. What is a bit disconcerting is the way the scenes were remastered. Clearly, the soundtrack of this footage had been lost or damaged, so some sparkle at Disney decided to dub the scenes with new dialogues. Which would have been great except that half the cast was not around to do it (some for better reasons than others) and the whole thing got a pretty bad quality for him. Part of the dubbing is pretty bad, and David Tomlinson's voice was dubbed by a guy who sounds absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson (there's actually a hint of German in it, I think). However, it's good to hear the full versions of all the songs (although "Step in the Right Direction" is still missing) and the magic moments in this movie still shine. And I dare you not to laugh when young Paul looks so innocently at Angela Lansbury and says "but what does this have to do with my button?"
