I can not currently believe this movie is rated as a 6.9. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the most moving Indian films I've ever seen. It was very refreshing to see a movie showing the traditional family cinema. As for the story, I thought it was great that it was about shahid kapur being set up at a wedding arranged with amrita rao. He is sort of a happy and lucky guy while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle but the only problem is that her cousin does not seem to get as much attention as her aunt does not like. Amrita with a passion. This upsets Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very touching to see that although the Amrita family was not as wealthy, perhaps only middle class for the lower class, while the Shahids family was very high, they still treated the family with respect and did not even ask about what actually struck A nerve with me. That's because I've actually seen people being very rude to people who are not so well into thinking they are below their standards, which I feel is very superficial. This movie showed that the Shahids family was willing to look at the great values ​​that Amrita had been created and turned a blind eye to the fact that she was not a daughter of wealthy business tycoons or anything. After all, this movie deserved an 8/10 I wish more and more of these types of movies were made.
