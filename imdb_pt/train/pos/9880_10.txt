This movie was made in 1943, when I think Judy was at her peak (seems wise). In her previous film, For Me and My Gal, people often say that she seems emaciated. Well, in this movie she looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has a talent for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is hilarious, especially in the beginning, when she's trying to audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes is, in my opinion, the version of Lady Macbeth made by Judy and when John is looking for her at the party to give him a beating (Lol). <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, in one minute he despises her and in the other they go out on a date, the next time they meet after that date, they're in love. <br /> <br /> Another point I did not like was the opening night. . If I were Lily, I'd be furious with John, but she's not ... that just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> But on the whole, I would have to give a 10 to this movie because it is simply wonderful and almost perfect.
