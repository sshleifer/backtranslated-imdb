One of the best movies ever made! Because it only has a rating of 7.6 is a mystery. This movie is a window into the world of black experience in America. Must be a must see for all whites and all children over 10 years. I recommend seeing it with "The Long Walk Home" as a complement. If you think Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares," think again. Do not miss this movie, which should have won the Oscar. (And read the book too!)
