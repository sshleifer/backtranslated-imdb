I was able to watch this movie in its entirety and I was deeply moved by it. I was not sure if it was really a comedy or a drama - it had elements of both. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper looked wonderful - our image of 60-year-old women has certainly changed since Aunt Bee! They are vibrant, beautiful, sexy! The only downside to this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in the "MTM" or "Rhoda" shows of the 70's. I would have thought that since it was set in New York (where "Rhoda" had been set) the less mention would have been made of her sister Brenda or Julie Kavner would have appeared, assuming, of course, that she was still in the Big Apple. <br /> <br /> It is my hope that ABC will make it a series and bring back to the guest appearances all the old cast of these shows. By the way, what was wrong with CBS doing this meeting, or an eventual series? Was not the network that loaded the "MTM" and "Rhoda" shows?
