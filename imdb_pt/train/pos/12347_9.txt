This is a wonderful film about a brothel in a fishing village, which could best be described with scene constellations and direction of the works of Kurosawa, combined with the topics of human psychology of Dostoyevski (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), the drama Shakespeare and Hans Christian Andersen. tragic and joyous. The script is wonderful, the scenes are colorful and beautiful, some scenes are really imprinted in my mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting - there is also some action, so if you do not like all the feelings, you will also cost -. It's not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their Bushido spilling all of them, but about the life, work and kind of people found everywhere at any time. A lovely and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa, certainly worth seeing.
