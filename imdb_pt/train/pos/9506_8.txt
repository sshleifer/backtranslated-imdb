A sober and reflective piece, a small miniature that blooms in a magnificent human pictorial sequence that goes beyond a mere dramatization of the screen. This little story will keep you fascinated - if you do not have many problems with the various Spanish accents, from Mexican to Peruvian, and the most authentic Iberian Peninsular use of Marisa Paredes! Garcídiego made a perfect adaptation of the novel: even the great maestro García Márquez should be proud of his superb work. And we took off the hat to Arturo Ripstein who so expertly arranged all the effort in a jewel, a ruby, and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so touching ..... <br /> <br /> The Colonel - Fernando Luján - is waiting to receive his pension, while still living in his wood falling to pieces in the middle of the Colombian jungle (however, filmed elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his fighting stick and his wife (in that order?). And that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> But, oh, much more .... This movie is a rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I need to see this little poetic piece again as soon as possible. Worth the high side of 8 out of 10, which is very high on my scale. <br /> <br /> This is not Hollywood's light commercial.
