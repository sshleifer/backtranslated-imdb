Two back-to-back films dealing with Indian prisoners of war; See Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara is a love story of a guy who gives everything for someone, Deewaar focuses on the main subject itself. It is not hidden that many Indian prisoners of war have been rotting in Pakistani prisons for years - for whom neither the Indian government. Have time or sympathy or the other side. I'm sure some Pakistani prisoners of war are in India as well, but let's focus on the movie. Full of actors. Some were stage actors like Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the Major, acted well. Akshaye Khanna did her part well. There was nothing for Amrita Rao to do than a few giggles and a few songs. I think the role of Sanjay Dutt was more solid, even if it was not too long. He acted very well here and his delivery of dialogues was also impressive. If you compare it to the LOC, which was nothing but a long day movie with the story going in all directions (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well directed film that keeps a good rhythm and does justice to all actors 7.5 / 10
