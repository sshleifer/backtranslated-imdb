We saw the VCR and found it to be fascinating. Without knowing anything about this true story, I thought, "Oh, no, P. Brosnan as an American Indian ('red' Indian in the film), what a bad choice" until you find out the truth about the gray owl. The film does a good job demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, who is as handsome and handsome as an Indian woman (I believe she is French-Canadian, she certainly reverts to the familiar speech of that). Despite Brosnan's disinterested and coarse style, in the end, he arrives convincingly as a passionate and dedicated man. The plot is a little weak in demonstrating his conversion from the hunter to the animal coservationist. Good movie, highly recommended.
