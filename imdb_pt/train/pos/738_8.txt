And this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. No matter how it evolved (to the point of being a movie about disco), it turned out to be one of the best movies that children want to excel in, but the main thing is in their way. Think of the 1950s rock'n'roll movies where the day is saved when Alan Freed comes to town with Chuck Berry to prove Rock & Roll Music is really cool and safe for kids, and Tuesday Weld gets a new sweater for dancing. For 1979, repeat the same plot, but play on DA RAMONES, which no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory DJ guest, "The Real" Don Steele ). Add all the elements of a comedy exploration film produced by Roger Corman, with the exception of the two-day filming schedule, some of Corman's well-known repertoire players such as Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (from "Bucket of Blood "), and you have one of the best stoopid movies of the day. One of the few films that uses deliberate tackiness and goes unpunished. I showed the new DVD to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a fog induced by the stoner in the drive-in, and he agreed that this is one of the best movies to watch drunk, not the least for the adorable leading ladies and the big Ramones filming.
