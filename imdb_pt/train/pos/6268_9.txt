Carter Wong plays a noble hero in search of a healing book that leads him to seek ultimate revenge! The pace is good in this movie and there are lots of fighting scenes to keep the movie going. The guillotines seem perverse and the main villain has no problem using them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and draws you to the end (which I felt could have had a following). <br /> <br /> Campy and dark, this is great ol skool kung fu !!
