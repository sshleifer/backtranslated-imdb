The problem is that the film was based on the 1960s concept that comics could only be made as a "camp" (ie the 1960s Batman show) for TV and film. So you have combat sequences with subtitles (come on!), Doc Savage (who did not feel comfortable around the women in the pulps, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair on a night sign (a scene that would guarantee nightmares for several nights ) and the totally disgusting ending with the secondary bad guy wrapped in gold as a Herv√© Villechez posing for an Oscar status. And when they're not doing Sousa's marching scores, the little "funny" song hurts a lot of the drama. <br /> <br /> Even so, this movie is ... okay. It's fun and when it stays serious, it's a very accurate representation of the pulps. Except for Monk, as was mentioned before: he is extremely muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a skinny, pale guy with an attitude, not Paul Gleason with a scarf (inexplicable). <br /> <br /> The sequences of Death Green, for example, are remarkably horrible and are not something I recommend to children. But they are very close to the feel of the pulps. When the writers and producers get it right, they get it right - I'll give it to them. <br /> <br /> But if the producers had done Doc with the affection and script of, say, Reeves' first work two Superman movies, think about what we could have then. I think the problem is schizophrenic in the movie. There's a definite sense of trying to pay homage to the thirties, but they're also trying to give in to the attitude of "heroes must be camp" that Batman created. You get the impression that there was a first draft and pulp-style and then someone came in and said, "Hey, let's do it funny-it worked on the Batman show 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> But Doc lives, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch is not paying tribute to Doc Savage in this movie, the man is truly insane. So when the series comes on TV (supposedly mid-season in 1999), Doc Savage, updated to the 90's, will live once again.
