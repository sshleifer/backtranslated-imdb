I found this movie to be suspense almost from the beginning. When Ms. Stanwyck begins his narration, it is only a few minutes until you realize that the problem is coming. The deserted area, the lock of the gas station door deserted, everything keeps you waiting ... here it comes. At first, you think it will be about the little boy, but very soon you begin to hold your breath as you see the tide coming in. I found this film really stressful, although I had seen it before and was prepared for the outcome. Now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you've seen it before deserves some sort of special rating, maybe a white prize of the fingers?
