Five deadly poisons are not as bloody and violent as Story of Ricky or Super Ninjas, but they feature some of the best hand-to-hand fighting sequences in Hong Kong's movie history. Director Chang Cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece. This film has launched the careers of the five men who throw the poisons. Meng Lo plays another bad ass. He would go to the Super Ninjas. Kuo Chui who is Philip Kwok would go on to Ricky's Story and Hard Boiled. Any spicy fan can push this. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also made by Chang Cheh). But everything is good and this is one of the best.
