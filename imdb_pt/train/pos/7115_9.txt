A wonderful and courageous war film that focuses on the inner torment of the blind marine Al Schmid. Although it is difficult and unpleasant, it is in the end heroic - Schmid's triumph over deficiency and depression. The battle scene was superb. But a bone to choose. No matter how many .50 bullets fired, I never saw any water or dirt being blown out! It hurt realism, but I can live with it. Beautiful performance by Eleanor Parker, again, as his girlfriend.
