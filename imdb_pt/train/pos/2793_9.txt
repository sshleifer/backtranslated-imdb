It's a shame that, because of the title, this movie is avoided by people who hate soccer. Bend like Beckham is much more than a tacky sports movie. The plot is touching and intelligent without being touchy, the jokes were funny and the characters are well interpreted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting on great performances on and off the field. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess's concerned father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who has been so incredibly evil in 'Ride with the Devil', comes across so well with the cool guy at once, making full use of his handsome Irish accent ! Even if you do not like football, go see this movie. If anything makes you smile.
