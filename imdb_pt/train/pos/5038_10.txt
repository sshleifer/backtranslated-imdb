That is real and quite unexpected. This is what a real thriller is. I ran to the video store, got a movie without reading the whole synopsis, and waited for the best. I was totally surprised and happy. I really liked the actors and their characters. I thought everyone gave great performance and made their characters realistic. The plot was well thought out, well written and directed. It kept you interested from start to finish and never got bored for a single minute. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to those who like thrillers, especially thrillers who are well paced and those who keep their attention. Definitely a 10 out of 10 of me.
