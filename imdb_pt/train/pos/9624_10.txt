As for Mel Harris, she's a great actress and for those who think she looks too old for Rob, it's only five years. <br /> <br /> Rob had a lead role in his own TV series as well as one in the series. Science fiction channel. I'm sure you remember Topical Heat, also known as Sweating Bullets and Jane PainKiller. <br /> <br /> He has also starred in several TV movies and is now doing a series of Mini TV. <br /> <br /> You need to give him more leadership roles which is what he is best at.
