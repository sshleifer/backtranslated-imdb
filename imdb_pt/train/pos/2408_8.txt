Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's Passion for Christ and was bothered by bloody violence would like to see this movie instead. Although it has not been a blockbuster or TV ratings success, The Fox Movie Channel still finds a good reason to show that yearly. I liked the way they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who played his disciples to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon did not have long hair like any other Jesus would do in other films, his appearance is very much like what a Jew looks like. What struck me or frightened me was the scene in which Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate: "And never forget that you are a Jew!" While this might not have been a racist remark, Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like crap to the eyes of the prominent men of those days. Pilates' portrait of Keith Michell was rambling, comparing to his previous performances in "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David." But if you compare your interpretation of Pilate with Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he really painted the impression of a Roman procurator.
