That could be a 10 if it were not the pretty predictable and Hollywood scenario. Daniel Day-Lewis confirms his position as one of the main actors of our time (why not the leader I can ask) and the rest of the cast at a very high level. I was personally impressed with Hugh O'Connor who played Christy Brown as a child. The first scene I watched was very strong. Wow.
