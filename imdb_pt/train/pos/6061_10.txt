I enjoyed this movie so much I watched it twice and that's something to say about a documentary. The musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning, as you would expect from an Imax production. Even if it's filmed for those huge Imax movie theaters, it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system. In fact, this would make a perfect DVD to demonstrate your system. <br /> <br /> The subject is also fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best race car in history since he is the only person to win the CART Championship, the F1 Championship, the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two very important cars the father and son. The first car is found in a chicken coop and ends up being the first roadster Mario drove and we followed the restoration to the glittering perfection. The other car is Michael's new racing car and we follow him from cutting the mold during the racing season. Imax lends the right magic to make car building fun and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who was the owner of Michael Amoretti's team at the time this movie was made, tells the film. His anecdotes and jokes, drawn from many years as owner and driver, lend much to production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the racing scenes. Turn up the volume here! There is something about walking at over 200 mph and the musical score that draws you totally to the screen, for an experience you will not forget. Wow!! <br /> <br /> The last magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This race god, Mario Andretti, is a loving father who proudly cares for his son's career. They work together so well that every parent and child should see this. You can tell they are a close family. I wish we could all have that experience.
