Okay, right. Sammo Hung has already starred in the lead role in "Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain" in 1983. Now, 2001, he does it again with "Zu Warriors". But this time, it finally does right. You rarely see it in wuxia, more often in the East Classic or the Crime Slayer. But that role simply fits him! The ancient Chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in films (as far as I know about films translated to the West). Although, the legend contains a lot of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight said: you have not seen a story in a modern movie yet! And that makes everything great! And wow: all the colors, plus the immensely deep and direct heart story makes you fall in love with this movie in an instant. The first time I watched, I had to watch it again immediately, and I did. Okay, true, I did not understand everything the first time. But that only makes it better! You know, you did not understand all this, because it has a lot of seasoning! So it is a pleasure for you to watch over and over again. And yes, it grows deeper in your heart, the more times you watch. <br /> <br /> Summary: A story to love, characters with whom you truly cry: a movie you never forget! - Editor's note: well, I think I need to watch it now: D
