"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in love, duets) has nothing to do with herself but to paint, go with her friends in her carriage up and down, greeting the people of the city and trying to make everyone know . I guess there were no movies, no television in those days, and the girls had nothing to do but gossip. I wish she had read some more. I like Gwyneth, and I think she's a beautiful young woman. She is talented and in "Emma" has the privilege of hearing Gwyneth sing. I look forward to seeing "Duets" where she should sing. She is brave to speak British English with all the British native, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dancing in Lughnasa). "Mrs. Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is a royalty of American cinema, none other than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony. Winner of the Blythe Danner Award (The Myth of Fingerprints). She'll expect to be around for a long time. Lucky ours! I liked Emma and also highly recommend. It's one of those old stories that's still accurate in those days. Favorite scenes: Emma singing and playing the piano. I especially like it when she sings a duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley "Emma, ​​you did not ask me to contribute an enigma." Emma: "Your whole personality is an enigma, Mr. Knightley. I thought you were superqualified." Miss Bates: "That has left us speechless, very speechless, I tell you, and we have not stopped talking about it ever since."
