I remember seeing that this is his original showing in 1962 with five or six years of age and really enjoying it. I recently had the opportunity to watch it again, for the first time since, as it was shown at Walt Disney Presents on the Disney Channel. I had forgotten most of it, and some of it was child friendly, but it was still nice. I can not wait to show it to my niece and nephews.
