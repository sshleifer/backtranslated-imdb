I have to be honest and say that I bought this movie, not because of the content, but because David Cubitt is in it; I know ... shallow, or what? - but, come on, Mr. Cubitt is a fantastic actor to say the least. <br /> <br /> I did not really know what to expect from watching this movie, I had read the other, and those on other websites, but I have to say that I was drawn to the sibling world almost from the beginning. David Cubitt as Theo and Colm Feore as Ryan are as believable as the two estranged brothers, the movie moves through their relationship when they begin to try to meet again after their father's death. The scene where Theo discovers that Ryan is gay has been played brilliantly, he literally steps in and tries to leave without Ryan noticing - which of course he did. <br /> <br /> The film was very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad, moving, uplifting and a celebration of life in parts. I got out of that sad feeling with what Ryan went through, but also with the knowledge that he received hope and unconditional love from former drug addict brother Theo. I agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where Theo says he will be a moving father, and I go a little further to say that I actually vocalized my thoughts to Ryan when he says ruthlessly to Theo 'What makes you thinking that he can be a father 'and Theo simply says' you'. Theo walks away then, but this little exchange of dialogues tells a lot about Ryan's almost self-pitying aspect, which is emphatically emphasized by the simple retort. <br /> <br /> A brilliantly designed film about all aspects, acting, directing, writing etc are all so well done. I really can not find anything else to say about this movie except to say that it is very difficult to deal with the death of a loved one but this is done in a superb way, to an infinite degree. Respect for the subject and the outpouring of love (without being contrite and insipid) speaks volumes in this selfish world we live in today. Well done to all involved. <br /> <br /> There are not many movies that tear me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general, and also to be content with all the things I have and not be sad about things. I do not, but this movie did, it was incredibly uplifting considering the subject.
