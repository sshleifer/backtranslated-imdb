Penny Princess meets the American employee Yolande Donlon, the heiress of a small kingdom in the triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland meet, called Lampidorra. It seems that the Lampidoranos owe accounts throughout Europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggled because of its geography. An American multi-millionaire buys the place, but dies before getting the title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But is it clear that ownership has to go through successions in America and what the Lampidorrans should do? Especially since Donlan, who has now become a princess, has banned smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde, who is on a trip to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems the Lampidorrans have a type of cheese they call Schmeeze. With a few bumps on the road, Schmeeze solves all the financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> As Schmeeze works, well, that's the whole scam trick. But here's a tip. In Lover Come Back, Jack Kruschen may have just gotten Schmeeze's secret when he was busy inventing VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Penny Princess is a delicious mix of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon once again plays a role that Marilyn Monroe would have been chosen had the film been made this side of the pond. Dirk Bogarde was well cast in the part that was early in his career as a pulsating romantic heart long before anyone but him suspecting that he had the talent he had. <br /> <br /> This movie was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning at TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
