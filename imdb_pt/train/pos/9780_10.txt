I saw this movie at the BIFFF Festival in Brussel in the spring of 2004. What a surprise! This German production, an elegant and imaginative shock, is one of the scariest I have ever seen. Be warned: this is not a joke! This terrorist has a large cast of good actors (as an example: Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence), excellent direction, pleasing production design, a very good and very heavy soundtrack such as Italian horror films in the decade eighty. Beef ripped to the bone ... and blood runs red ... this wild Heart Stopper will grab you ... and give you some dark dreams ... Must Do !!
