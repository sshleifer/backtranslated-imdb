This was one of those wonderful and rare TV moments I wished I had captured forever on VHS. Are not you going to breathe again? <br /> <br /> It was very creative and I remember it aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating. I want to see everything again. I want to buy this. I want what I can not have. Not even on EBAY. <br /> <br /> So, having got enough of it, it was by far one of the best series that the 80's have released. It should be considered a classic, but it is lost in space. At least this site and Wikipedia mention this. Under. <br /> <br /> He was totally attractive, funny, flirty and original. Perhaps not as the original Sherlock Holmes, I think Quintin is much more attractive and has a better chance with its protagonist than Holmes ever got.
