I am the father of a child with special needs and I really enjoyed the movie! It was loving, warm and fun. I learned a long time ago to see the humor in things. I especially thought it was sweet as all the other characters cared about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died. I watched a focus show of the film with other parents and siblings of children with special needs before the movie was edited. Everyone liked the movie and really inspired wonderful discussions. We talk about how our kids make us laugh and we also talk about how we care about them. The screenwriter talked about how she has worked with autistic children and other children with special needs as a volunteer for several years. She based the character on a real person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that made us go through some very stressful times. I give the movie two thumbs up !!!
