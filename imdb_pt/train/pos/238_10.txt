You can hardly imagine a better movie than that <br /> <br /> Hey, before you go "Chick Flick" with me. I'm a Big Male and Strong, Male Man, who thinks this was one of the best movies of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The performance was superb and the story was wonderful. This is a wonderful remedy for the heart and soul. The actor could not have been better nor the best cast of the film. <br /> <br /> I know for a long time that Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Lady Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, Judi Dench is among the greatest actresses ever to appear in the movies. And, of course, Cloris Leachman (also in this film), in my opinion, can in fact overcome all of them in the magnificence of their talent and varied roles in which it has appeared over the years. Anyway, this was an incredible cast. This movie was like a book you can not establish, and when you reached the last page desire for more ... even more. I can not for the life of me understand why this movie here on IMDb only rates a 3.9 <br /> <br /> That rating here is totally amazing for me. Or maybe not. Maybe, in fact, I understand this very well and that's what makes me really sad. This makes me so sad that movies like "American Beauty", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" are very popular when, in fact, at least in this view, viewers should have received "R" . "rating ... R that's for" Garbage. "Hey, okay, I realize there are many different stories in this world for many different audiences, but it's a sad commentary when this adorable, powerful film ... extraordinarily directed, acted and The conclusion is that, if you want to see a beautiful, happy, sad and beautiful story, watch it, it seems to be over. <br /> <br /> Obviously I was at the Academy Awards too ... How sad. ...... preferably own this movie ...
