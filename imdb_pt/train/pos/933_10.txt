I saw this movie in sixth grade at Christmas time, and I was very excited to see it, and when I heard George C. Scott was involved, I was really excited because I really love George C. Scott! When my class and I were watching this movie, I liked it very much and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was totally fabulous! This is the best version of the classic novel by Charles Dickens that I've seen so far! The performance of George C. Scott as Scrooge is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he is the definitive Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other is Patrick Stewart's, but this one is the best! <br /> <br /> What is really good at this is the acting, I found the actors were fabulous, everyone was, the spirits, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, they could not have found anyone better than the they made the parties! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! He is the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think they could have found anyone better! I do not think they could have found anyone better to replace anyone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This film is probably the definitive cinematographic adaptation of the classic of Charles Dickens, and I really think you will agree, you will find that this movie is fabulous! I'll probably have to buy this movie on DVD because I thought it was totally fabulous! I totally recommend you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
