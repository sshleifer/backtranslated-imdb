I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it was heralded as a must-see movie for people who love movies about nature. The film shows different climates and the animals associated with them, starting at the North Pole and heading south as the film progresses. The images in this movie are often incredibly beautiful and I have often wondered how on Earth they could have taken some photos underwater or in the sky. As beautiful as it was, most of the footage I had seen on the TV series 'Planet Earth', narrated by David Attenborough. I found Attenborough's story of Planet Earth far better than Earth's narration. 'Earth' is an easier movie. It skips much of the scientific detail that Attenborough covers in his "Planet Earth" series. For example, Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery, because water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support very large animals, such as large sharks, etc. For me, that's an important difference. This, along with Attanborough's top voice, makes Planet Earth a much better documentary than Earth. Still, however, I think the Earth is worth watching the beautiful footage and the fact that it is easier to understand makes it interesting for children too.
