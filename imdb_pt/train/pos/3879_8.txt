A typical Clausen film, but again not typical. Clausen writes, directs and plays one of the leading roles. This is really a great movie about normal people living normal lives trying to do their best. The 4 main actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You believe he really is sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who really is an actor, but it turns out she is the best nurse to take care of the old man. <br /> Everyone has problems and anyone who believes ends up being happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to earn their life and love.
