This is a really fun movie. One of these you can sit and watch without thinking as the plot gets more and more distorted; more and more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in his prime), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr. Are all these well-known and quality actors acting as if they were stars / soap operas. If you've ever watched a soap opera and thought, "How did they come up with this idea?", You'll love this movie. I've seen it several times; and every time I watch, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I realize how successful it really is. Do not expect Oscar quality. This is a fun movie to entertain, not an artistic attempt to find the "inner man of man", etc. Sit down, relax and laugh.
