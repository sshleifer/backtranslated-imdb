I liked watching Cliffhanger in the beginning when that woman (Sarah) was full of terror when she was slipping, I thought it was a terrifying scene as I would think that when you see it, your nerves in your body come to you because it does you get full of fear and your heart beats faster. I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger, I think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and I think he will be known as Rambo and Rocky.
