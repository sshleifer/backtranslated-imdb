A 14-year-old girl develops her first passion for the 17-year-old boy who lives nearby, while trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is the simple premise of this beautiful and poetic film about the adulthood of director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for driving previously the summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the genre of adulthood. Here he directs newcomers to the lead roles: Reese Witherspoon, in his movie debut, as the 14-year-old; Emily Warfield, as the elder sister; Jason London, as Court, the 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good at her movie debut, displaying all the emotions a 14-year-old girl feels when experiencing young love and heartache, never reaching a fake note. Warfield and London are equally good as well. The film accurately portrays each teenager's thoughts or feelings toward love with a sincere sensitivity, never surpassing the sentimental minimum even once. Congratulations to Jenny Wingfield's autobiographical screenplay; This is one of the few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple, accentuating the tone and mood of scene to scene, but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis, who was in his 70s when it was filmed. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston interpret the parents of the girls with accurate precision for 1957, careful, rigorous and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as the boy's mother. There are feelings to solve, lessons to learn and truths to be faced in this sweet-natured movie that packs an emotional blow. To this day, this is Robert Mulligan's latest film. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars.
