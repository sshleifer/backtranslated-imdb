I can not believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite host of the show, hands down. I hate celebrity gossip and I do not usually like talk shows, but when Hal Sparks hosted Talk Soup, I had to watch TV for myself. I rarely missed an episode during its run, and I was sad when the invited hosts started coming in (though most of the guests still did a good job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all the people who do not like Hal Sparks, I imagine they should never have seen the weekend specials. These were one-hour episodes of conversation soup that contained the best clips of the week, and were filled with sketch comedies. The original bits that Hal Sparks did were hilarious. In one he was possessed by a bad comedy demon, and in an exorcist scene as his head turned when he told dated jokes about airplane food. One episode was dedicated to making fun of Multiplicity, as a bunch of cloned Hal Sparks continued to multiply throughout the episode, beating the studio. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe it does not sound so funny when I describe them, but all I know is that in addition to Talk Soup, the only other two shows I've seen consistently during those years was The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian. So if you like the comedy styles of these shows, then you probably like Talk Soup during the Sparks years. <br /> <br /> That being said, Henson and Tyler were also great hosts. All three hosts brought something different to the table, but they were all good comedians in my opinion. Of course, during the years of Tyler and actress, my interest in this show began to subside, but from time to time I pick up The Soup, the spiritual successor of the show, and sure enough, the new host can bring some unexpected laughter from the show. time. Until now. <br /> <br /> OK, I wasted enough time talking about a TV show that is no longer on the air and on a channel I usually despise. Go watch something else!
