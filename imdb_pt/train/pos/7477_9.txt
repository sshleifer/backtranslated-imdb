This film is made up of such a thrill, especially with its excellent soundtrack that matches the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm in making movies and entertaining. This movie was not the best the first time I watched it, but after 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes place in New York and progresses in your lifestyle. He discovers a demarcation in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then through a mixture of imagination. This movie was beyond my expectations and is one of the best Cruise movies of all time!
