This movie is definitely on the list of my 10 favorites. The voices of the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the cheeky feline and the young inexperienced dog, but the real highlight is Don Ameche as the faithful old golden retriever. This movie is a great movie for the family because it can be enjoyed and loved by children and adults alike. Good-humored and full of suspense, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (happy tears!)
