An adaptation of the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and an always stunning performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing on so many levels and I was disappointed that it did not win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time so it was forgotten. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone, you will be touched by its history and really makes the audience become empathetic with this youngster who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you like inspiring true stories, then watch Antwone Fisher. Thank you
