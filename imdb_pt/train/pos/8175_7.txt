Before we start, I'm afraid of dentists. This movie makes me shiver and even makes me shiver. That's what I love about this movie. The movie is kind of boring. For this, I shot 3 stars! Spoiler Alert The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone, who has just discovered that his wife is cheating on him. Soon, he begins to hallucinate and begins torturing his patients, killing co-workers, and he even tortured his wife to death and killed the man with whom he was having an affair. <br /> <br /> The film is very bloody and bloody. I would recommend it if you have blood. <br /> <br /> I give this film 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your normal daily dentist!
