Now or you like Mr. Carrey's humor or not. Me, Irene and I had the audience walking in droves and, on the other hand, applauding and crumbling into puddles of joy. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you've been warned. <br /> <br /> If you are not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laugh at the same jokes when I saw the movie. If you do not find the sight of a dog lowering the seat after using the funny toilet, do not worry about the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a reporter stuck in a routine covering 'lighter news'. rebukes God when his whole life seems to be going into the pot. God accepts the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey enters the rhythm of having all of God's powers, making his girlfriend's (Jennifer Aniston)'s breasts larger by promoting and responding to everyone's prayers for single-course computer commands. <br /> <br /> This is not a highbrow or even memorable movie, but it is very well done within its very limited intention, it provides almost continuous chuckles to Carrey's fans, and even any religious quarrel is probably inoffensive for all but the most narrow and anti-serious squads of god. At the most thoughtful level, the movie tries to speculate on Carrey's career - stuck in his "comedy" comedy, he failed to impress as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes. His most 'honest' role, the Man on the Moon, is less known than his comedies - or The Truman Show (in which the Academy received three nominations at the same time as it skirted Carrey).
