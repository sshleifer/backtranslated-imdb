Tony Hawk Underground reached a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really on air about what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series that would be different it's interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced the storymode, which was really cool because it created a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. Another feature introduced by which fans practically defended and who was able to get off the skateboard, which is cool because now you can really climb, run and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft also improved on a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of the level projects. The first two games for PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were good and long and some features hidden in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and actually pushed the systems too their limits. In that version, they shortened those features, not so many people wondering about the streets, actually there are almost none at some levels, and the graphics and physics of the skateboard are lessened a little but not much. <BR> This game has a counter, the storymode is a bit short, of course this is the first time Neversofts does this with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so this is understandable. However, with that said, you will definitely end this game within a day. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.
