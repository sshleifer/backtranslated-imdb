Shintar√¥ Katsu, who played the blind swordsman "Zatoichi" in a total of 27 films, closes the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he makes love to a ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> The great staff, often used in the pursuit of justice, is taken away forever. Katsu was his usual cheeky self while chasing those who stole from the treasury to lend usurally to those he could not afford. <br /> <br /> The gruesome ability and astounding ability of the big one were present along with the blood. <br /> <br /> I'll miss him.
