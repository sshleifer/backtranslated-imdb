Well, I had seen "They all laughed" when it came out in Europe around 1982 and they kept a vague but expensive memory. I just saw him again on tape, almost twenty years later ... Bogdanovich has a sincere tenderness for his characters and a kind of sympathy that is hard not to feel too. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone and very good editing too. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just like all of us sometimes. Go get it.
