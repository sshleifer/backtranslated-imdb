I consider this film a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 or 5 times to see it, so to realize what great movie it was. First, it describes a World War II face that we do not normally see in Hollywood movies. In particular, the German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government are shown more "humanized". One of the facts that struck me most was the mention at the end of the film of a murder in a forest in the last 20 years ... that the forest is where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz occur: these are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another clue for those who like the details is the representation of the doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with changes in people each time they cross a door, or when a door is opened. Many ports are shown on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc. anytime that happens. Have you noticed that?
