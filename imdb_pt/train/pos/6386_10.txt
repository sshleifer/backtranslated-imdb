Disney, the name of the movie that was once considered innocent and suitable for all ages, finally began to realize that in order to survive, it needs to become more diverse. This diversity has been very apparent in the past two years. Films like "Tarzan" and "The Emperor's New Groove" have made an attempt to move away from Disney's traditional song routine and into a new, unfamiliar territory. "Atlantis" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is Disney. The first serious film to come out of the Disney animation studio is a great achievement for them - in fact, it is so serious that it reaches PG territory. Perhaps because many families were afraid to see him last summer. <br /> <br /> But despite the more mature subject, this is still a movie that Disney wanted to attract to families, not only mature the audience had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting the enough to get him out of the "Little Mermaid" kingdoms and others. <br /> <br /> So what we have is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the coup being condensed into a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, this is an action movie about Atlantis, not about the exposure that precedes it, so we are taken for the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as possible without losing coherence. Suspend your disbelief at how characters move from point A to point B so quickly, you are unlikely to find a detailed animated movie coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, go to James Cameron's "Titanic." Both films feature a boat in some way. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about love, shall we? Yes, as with many films, the protagonist (a Milo Thatch, a clumsy archeologist) and a female protagonist (Kida, the cliché princess of Atlantis) are about to fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as cliche as I'd hoped. At the end of the film, for the first time, the sequence of touching / feeling / kissing the characters was much more subdued. There are several points in the movie in which the attraction grows, but it simply is not in the stage of, say, "The Little Mermaid" (A Good Thing). <br /> <br /> You may have noticed that this is somewhat cliche movie. Correct. You have your main hero and heroine, supported by more than half a dozen crew members who take part in the expedition, all having their moments during the film. Numerous other characters appear, occupy the few minutes of display and disappear. Does not it take a genius to do the math? a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a handsome cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any extent. So, what does this depend on? Clichés and many of them. Each character emulates something that was done a thousand times before. Do you have the clumsy scientist, the attractive princess, the square-chinned colonel, the rich eccentric, the manic sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale ?? Do I need to continue? <br /> <br /> I do not know why it came to anyone ?? I found the ironic nature of this movie quite amusing. Okay, this must be a serious movie, but do you really expect Disney to abandon all the traces of your story? At least the writers have tried to create consistently witty dialogues, and sometimes it's even a bit inspired. <br /> <br /> But in the end it's those awesome visuals that put the cherry on top of this cake. The CGI animation is really amazing in some places, and it does not outperform the characters, which was a flaw that left the recent "Titan A.E." low. Speaking of characters, Disney hired an artist from the comic book industry to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes much to the anime, much more than any previous Disney tour. This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, "Nadia," for the film's general similarities to the cartoon series. Not having seen this anime, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> With the picture, there is sound. Gary Rydstrom leads the sound team and that soundtrack! From the opening shot, the sound stage is alive and is a treat. James Newton Howard treats us with a dynamic soundtrack that complements the film in all its forms, never sounding out of place and always helping to build tension or overwhelm it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed the point the creators intended. For me, the film conveys that it's an adventure ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney movie before it. If you do not like the ironic attitude cliché then maybe the effort that was poured on the visuals enchants. Heck, at least, the mythology is much more correct than one can say about other Disney efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was surprised by this movie. Do I always disbelieve my disbelief with any animated film? after all, real-world laws are most often broken in the midst of cartoons. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and maybe everyone can find something to enjoy this movie.
