I've always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris at the movies. Although the acting is not superb, the fighting scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform alongside him. In my opinion, the Norris brothers proved to be great artists and this was another good production! I hope you enjoy watching this movie!
