Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> The last PPV of 2006 <br /> <br /> Brand Smackdown. <br /> <br /> Result Results In Front ******** <br /> We are starting the show with the game The Inferno. Kane v. MVP. This was a good game. Nothing about wrestling here. That was about the look. Overall this was not bad. There were some points here with Kane getting very close to the fire, but in the end, Kane won with MVP on the first fire. <br /> <br /> Good opener. Let's continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new game for team titles: London and Kendrick will defend themselves from: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM in a LADDER MATCH !!!! Let's move on! <br /> <br /> Combine two: Fatal four-way combination. That was total carnage. Judging from three of the four teams here, you would expect chaos. The points were amazing. A total spot-fest. One point Jeff went to Poetry in Motion and London changed and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly after, Jeff is put on the top rope with two nearby stairs, while MNM was going to kill Jeff, Matt saved and Jeff hit the shot from Joey Mercury! Mercury is wounded. Your eye is closed quickly and is opened in a difficult way. Mercury is withdrawn from the match and Nitro is still there. He'll fight alone for the titles! Regal and Taylor then take London and put him on the stairs! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro into a killing spot, dropkicks down the ladder to preach Jeff! Impressive! In the end, London and Kendrick retain the titles of the tag teams. What a combination !!! <br /> <br /> That was insane. I can not understand why WWE has not announced it until now. Buyrate would increase enormously. I'm sure the replay value will be good. <br /> <br /> Mercury suffered a broken nose and lacerations in the eye. He's in the hospital now. Stay well boy. <br /> <br /> No way, anything else here will overcome this. <br /> <br /> Next: The Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) This was a game nothing. Will the bogeyman ever fight? Miz sucks too. After an insane crowd, this kills them dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. This was a strong game. I liked. Chavo hit a superplex killer at one point! Benoit has hit EIGHT German suplexes too! Benoit wins with the sniper. Boas COISAS. <br /> <br /> Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight title game championship. This was a good game. Unfortunately, stupid fans did not care. BECAUSE? Helms and Yang are very talented and fought well. I agree with JBL. He shouted to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate it or leave. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride game. Not much here. This was a slug party, with a few exceptions. Kennedy, at one point, threw Taker from the top of the stage to the floor. The place was fine. Reaction was disappointing. The final stop was Taker, who stoned Kennedy in the hearse and won the match. Unreal. Kennedy needed that victory. Both work hard. Still, Kennedy needed that victory. Undertaker should have lost. Creative spoiled it all again. <br /> <br /> One stupid diva thing is next. I like women. Not that. At least Torrie was not here. This is refreshing. Judging from the crowd, Layla should have won. WWE wanted Ashley. Consider this your bathroom range. Next. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Cena & Batista Vs. Finlay & Booker T. This was also a game nothing. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work well together. Finlay tries to make the Scene look good. The finish has been spoiled. Finlay hit Batista's knee with a chair kick and Batista did not sell the kick and finished the game. Lame. Not the main caliber of the event. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder game was the main event here. That was enough money worth there. Some others were solid. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A good PPV with the start of the ladder being the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show just not attractive enough. Smackdown needs to stop letting the tag track. Let the Smackdown stand on both legs. This show proves that Smackdown can.
