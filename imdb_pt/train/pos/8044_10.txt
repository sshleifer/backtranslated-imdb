Firstly, this is simply the funniest movie I have ever seen. It incorporates perfectly timed slapstick, sexually humorous and smartly thought out stand-up. But it goes far beyond that. The Opposite Souler is an original love story (something we do not see often) that gave me hope that there is love out there, that two people who love each other can overcome their adversities; and that such comedy take over life (something I believe we should all have) can be accepted by the people who really matter. Chris Meloni gives a performance as convincing as Barry Singer, that he should have won an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written and hopefully we will see more films of all involved in the future.
