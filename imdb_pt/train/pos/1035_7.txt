This film was nominated for best film but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas outclassed Humphrey Bogart for best actor. I do not see why Lucile Watson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, I just do not think she did a good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children are leaving Mexico and coming to the United States in the first scene of the film. They are going by train to the home of Davis's relatives. Davis and Lukas were underground to stop the Nazis, so they are very tired and need to rest. But when they get home, theirs is a Nazi who lives there and what they can not do either. It turns out that the Nazi only cares about money and is willing to make a deal with Lukas. Yours is more into the plot, but you can figure this out for yourself.
