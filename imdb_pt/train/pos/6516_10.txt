Hello. I watched this movie today for the 14th time in 3 days. I am a history teacher who has a lot of time in my hands. I need a life. I found the film that contains a striking resemblance to the broken mountain. I also thought I looked a lot like Jean Lafitte if he was white. Also, my favorite phrase in the whole movie was Mr. Petey - "This baby can shoot the eye of a 300-meter squirrel!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British were coming in, and the only drummer who was so dedicated to his work, and he played to death, as if that drum would end the war altogether ... but it would not be . Well, that's all I'd like to say about this movie. Ah, one more thing ... dark brown is an insane mood bipolar physco rocking BEEYOTCH. that is all.
