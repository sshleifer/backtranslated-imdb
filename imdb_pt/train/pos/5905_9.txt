This is a very well done film. Sumitra Bhave has always made sound cinema and this is my favorite movie for her. This movie should have won the National Award and would have been my choice to represent India at the Oscars. It's at least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which is going to the Oscar, from India this year. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the information on this (and all other Indian films)) on IMDb is missing and sometimes even wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar has played a very important character in this film and is not even credited in these pages. The rest of the cast and crew are also not mentioned. Awards and nominations for this film are not granted even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There was not even a single vote for 'Doghi'. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It's Marathi and, fortunately, escapes from the music and dance sequence, does not get caught up in glitzy glamor and an unsightly stylist. It is a real and soulful story, made with a rare understanding and respect. The Doghi, which can be translated as "two women," is a story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. In fact, it's a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not venture into many subplots, and this makes it a very difficult film to direct. The entire film is set in a remote village not described in Maharashtra and the screen rarely creeps away from the home of the two female protagonists. No aesthetic sunsets in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie opens and we are introduced to the whole house, which is preparing for Gauri's wedding. As the father of Gauri and Krishna is a hardworking farmer, the house is full and happy; there is nothing they want in their simple lives. However, on the eve of the wedding, Gauri's husband is faced with a fatal accident. Gauri's father can not stand the tragic news and suffers a major stroke. Without a strong and hardworking member, the house could have collapsed, but Gauri's mother took over. She works as and when she can but can not survive. But her life is still easier than Gauri's. Superstitions, which people try to forget, make Gauri a bearer of bad luck. She is outcast society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes for her brother. Desperate for help, she accepts his suggestion. He takes Gauri to Mumbai, where she is forced to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money he earns and his conditions improve. Gauri gives his life for his family. <br /> <br /> However, when Gauri returns home to Krishna's marriage, his mother does not go out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna to be near her and does not allow Gauri to stand in front of the guests. She loves Gauri, but fears for Krishna's life. This breaks Gauri completely and she decides to go back to her unhappy life. But Krishna runs and holds Gauri. She begs her beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stay by her side. Promise that they would face the world? together. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that is not needed in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri goes to Mumbai, but what does she do there is never said? the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know. It is only bare history, which is profound in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is responsible cinema. He is respectful of the subject he deals with. Are you respectful of your audience? do not think they have the mental capacity of a four-year-old. <br /> <br /> The acting is of the first order. Is the direction wonderful? the silences carry the story forward in a way that no word could have. The script is well researched. <br /> <br /> Anyone who enjoys a good cinema is bound to like 'Doghi'.
