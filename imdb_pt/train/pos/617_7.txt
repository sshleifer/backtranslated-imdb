Greetings again from the darkness. This will be compared to "The Promised Princess" and although it does not fit into this classic, it is extremely fun and well done by itself. The plot is a little strange and the whole thing on the wall is never really explained, but the execution is good, even building a strong suspense. Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls in love with the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to get her a fallen star ... to be played by dazzling Claire Danes. There is not much suspense as to what happens to these two, but the suspense part comes with the evil witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Prince Peter's son Prince O'Toole wanting to retrieve the ruby ​​necklace our "star" is wearing. A lot of bad chasing the good. <br /> <br /> Along the way, an encounter with the stranger of the pirates you will see (including any of the Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - hard inside, and we must say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a quick talking operator and this is good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> It's not your typical chase, maturing or fancy movie, but director Matthew Vaughn ("Layer" .cafe) deserves an audience. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the poor marketing campaign will likely prevent it I think you will find great success in video.
