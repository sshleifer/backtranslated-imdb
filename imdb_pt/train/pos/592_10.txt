In Arlington Heights, IL, we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools (1961), so I cycled from school to lunch and always watched this game. True, I was 11, but I thought it was the best thing! I would draw pictures hidden on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it. I also remember having won wonderful cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the competitor had the last hidden game of photos. I even had the homemade version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so little time. I liked the music and the hidden images - the only one I could get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden chain. <br /> <br /> Really good memories are connected with Camouflage.
