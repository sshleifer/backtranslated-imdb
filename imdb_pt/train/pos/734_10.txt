This movie is a jolt of fun punk rock, from beginning to end. The Ramones, reigning punk rock princes of the late 70's, appear as themselves. PJ Soles stars as Riff Randle, the high school rebel who lives and breathes rock 'n' roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for the Ramones, his favorite rock band. She keeps the school hectic, and encourages her classmates to join her in their exulting playfulness. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the school Riff attends has just hired a brand new director named Togar. She is a tall and intimidating woman. And she promises to make the line of students 'toe-the-line'. She even has a couple of students who act as monitors, who report to her with filth in her classmates. Togar is especially determined to arrest Riff and end Riff's anarchic antics. But Riff has clever ways to frustrate Togar at every turn. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the excellent performance of Mary Woronov in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary movie actress. And in this film, she plays the fascist Ms. Togar with an air of contempt. PJ Soles like Riff, turns into an electrifying performance. Clint Howard as the dubious Eaglebauer, has much fun with his role. <br /> <br /> The Ramones perform many of their hit songs in this movie. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential in the 1970s punk rock scene. Certainly, this is a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you do not like the Ramones, or Punk rock, this movie is a great explosion (literally) of energetic fun.
