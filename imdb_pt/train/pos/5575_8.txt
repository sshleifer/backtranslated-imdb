I did not expect much of it, but I have to admit it was rolling on the floor, laughing a few times during that movie. If you are not offended in the first ten minutes, this may be a movie for you. Ditto if you're the type that would like to watch Amanda Peet shuffling the cards for an hour and a half. It's certainly not an important comedy job, but given the low-budget genesis, this is masterful. To level the playing field for comparison, imagine all studio movies with their budgets reduced by a factor of 100 or more and see what you get! Lots of compliments to Peter Cohen and his network to see this. I look forward to your next effort.
