Probably the best fantasy film ever made. Sumptuous colors, spectacular sets, incredible, Miklos Rosza musical point that is perfect for every scene and mood. Acting is superb also in what could have been stiff and pretentious in smaller hands, but here the poetic dialogue is cleverly spoken with sensitivity (the humor is also subtle and delicious). <br /> <br /> No doubt, Spielberg and Lucas were delighted with this one. Together with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two best films released by Alexander Korda and London Films - and one of the best films of all time. <br /> <br /> A true, attractive classic!
