There is no relation between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are police series on violent crimes. Profiler looks crunchy, Fortier looks classic. Profile plots are fairly simple. The plot of Fortier is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to identify similarities ... The main character is weak and strange, but has "clairvoyance". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about just enjoying it? Funny thing too, people who write Fortier look like Americans, but on the other hand, they argue that they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are very good and funny. Performance is not superficial at all ...
