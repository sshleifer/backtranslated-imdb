My left foot is an epic film that explains the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, a severe disability and had only left foot use, but he was challenging, he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times and every time I see it, I find it equally brilliant every time. I wonder how this incredible movie did not win a Best Picture Oscer. it's a fuss over the academy's awards. Jim Shirdan is to me one of the greatest directors in the world. The script, the music and everything else is great in this movie. As the movie continues, you will almost feel your in the brown house as everything happens. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are astounding as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally brilliant as Dra Eileen Cole who helps Christy in her challenge battle. The Irish film industry had noticed his name a lot before my left foot. My left foot was the beginning of a wonderful period in Irish cinema. movies as powerful and brilliant as the field, the game of crying in the name of father and Michael Collins followed my left foot. These Irish films were so well viewed all over the world and were nominated for various Oscars and won a few. My left foot is an excellent movie. Daniel Day-Lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly, and the same goes for Hugh Conner, who plays the young Christy. These two performances are two of the best film performances of all time, especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, which I would consider as tall as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel Day-Lewis has proven in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is a great work of art on film, see!
