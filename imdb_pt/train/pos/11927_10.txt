I have to say, despite comments, Angels in the Outfield was a very good movie. I like the fact of teaching children to always have faith and never give up because miracles can happen. Unlike the other baseball movies, this particular movie stood out because of incredible special effects and orchestrated soundtrack that was very interesting. Although I liked this movie, it had some flaws, like some irrelevance (for example, in the end, when Ray Mitchell hits a homer, he does not step on the plate and so it would not be a soundtrack. really impressed by the presence and moral of the film: Just have faith, do not give up.
