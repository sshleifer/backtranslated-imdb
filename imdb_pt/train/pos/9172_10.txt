I studied Charlotte Bronte's high school novel, and it left me with an impressive impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple character with a strong mind and self-will. His story, which Bronte told through Jane's own eyes, was sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story, and this surprised me. The mini-series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte's original text and to the essence of the story, but the actors who played the characters were great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, by the name of Rochester) have brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone else in their roles. (The other Rochester performances in other versions, such as the 2006 version, lack the passion, energy and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately.) I would say that Timothy Dalton is at the top because he has all these characteristics in his Rochester interpretation. only looks like Jane Eyre, but she captures Jane's quiet but steady and passionate nature brilliantly. She keeps her emotions, like Jane's book, at the right times in the story, but allows her fire to leave Jane. which Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and faithful to the dedicated relationship of Jane and Rochester.) In addition, supporting actors also fit perfectly in their roles, and the scenarios fit the gothic nature of the story. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale. If you have not read the book before, you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story.
