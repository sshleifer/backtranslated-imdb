And my kids love that now! Granted, I can watch now and realize that the animation was not so good, and that plot is banal. Hey, if all the villains came forward saying "I'm a DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think they could be ridiculed, but for small children it's a moral story with captivating music. <br /> <br /> Music so captivating, remember, that I still had the words memorized after not seeing this movie in twenty years. I would definitely suggest this to younger children.
