Wes Craven was created one of the most successful murder thriller movies of all time. After watching movies, you will find your new fears. People do not know, that Wes Craven's thriller is the best, because they're all different. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Lisa is terrified by her traveling companion. He coercible her to kill and if she does not, Jack will kill his father. Lisa is in the big mess because whatever she chooses, she will kill. Acting was unreal. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy acted unbelievably. Emotions were in good choice. Idea and script of this movie is great too ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes it resembles a "scream", but it definitely better, than the "Screams" sequences together. <br /> <br /> And what can I say - this is the best murder thriller in the 21st century yet ...
