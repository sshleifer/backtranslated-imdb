This film was filmed at Gerard Gardens in Liverpool, and was the UK's response to films such as 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film holds the test of time very well, with all the moral stories still (or even more) relevant today. The film features an outstanding performance by some notable British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker portrays a Liverpool police officer assigned to juvenile liaison duties, with the premise that if you pick up young children they will ultimately be responsible for adults. <br /> <br /> Notable appearances in the film include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are real life brother and sister) who are caught in a firebrand web. Tsai Chin is still performing and can be seen in Nicole Kidman's latest movie, "The Interpreter." <br /> <br /> Violent Playground presents a gun lock in a school, so it is unlikely to be shown on TV following similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I lived in Gerard Gardens, where the film was filmed (although not born at the time), and I have fond memories of the area. I recently completed a documentary about Gerard Gardens, which includes excerpts from 'Violent Playground' and a small British 'Coast to Coast' film starring Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films in a way keep the memory alive. <br /> <br /> There were some complaints from the villagers when the film was released, as the film portrayed the area in a bad light. Time has helped heal those wounds. <br /> <br /> A little gem of a movie, I recommend you look for this
