This movie attracts you and leaves you addicted to keeping your eyes on the screen. The writer / director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting angles and camera perspectives that contribute to the retention he will have in you. Insomniac Nightmare is unique and pleasantly different from any other movie you've seen. Is it a dream or a reality? This indie will get you to discuss the twists you take through the conscious and subconscious. He has a strange feeling with his dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan has really become the insomniac. He is a great actor who is not too hard on his eyes! He really poured his whole being into this role. From the plot to the way it's filmed, this indie is one of my favorites. I highly recommend and look forward to seeing more of this innovative, creative writer / director / cinematographer !!!
