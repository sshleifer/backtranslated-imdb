I felt that racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear were grossly overdramatized for the Hollywood effect. I do not believe the US Navy has been so overtly racist. I can not imagine a complete Captain, the Commander, never telling his boss to intentionally beat someone. It certainly does not risk your life. And there was never a Chief Petty Officer as a blatant prejudice against all but WASPs as the character of DeNiro. No boss as sloppy and drunk as he was thrown would never have made it to the Master Chief in the first place. Cuba Gooding saved a bad movie.
