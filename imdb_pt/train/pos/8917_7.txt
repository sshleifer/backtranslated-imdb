A meteorite falls into the country of a small town, carrying a gelatinous creature. An old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and the young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully treats the blister and asks Steve to investigate where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the bubble killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and residents, but no one believes them, while the bubble swallows many people, getting bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a classic cult and science fiction. . It's a low-budget movie, with many actors and actresses (except for Steve McQueen), terrible effects, but also delicious and very, very funny. This is the first time I see this classic (I had seen the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to fans of Steve McQueen and the science fiction B movies of the 1950s. of my revision number 1,400 could not be better. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "The Blob"
