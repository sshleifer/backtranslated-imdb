Thats My Bush is, first of all, a very entertaining show of Parker and Stone, I thought. Its often very very funny, and is quite subversive and crazy. South Park fans would certainly get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the value of production here. A lot of money must have been put into it, and it shows. A lot of small expensive details. It's not a small show. And Comedy Central is not an extremely rich channel, but they do put a lot on this show, obviously. In a way I understand it was the death of the show, though, very expensive. It certainly could have been made cheaper and was at ease was there. <br /> <br /> Critics liked it, and had its small fan base, but it did not get a large audience. As we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, which I think is almost a season. <br /> <br /> As I really enjoyed the show, it has its flaws. The problem with the show is that it does not know what it really wants to be. It's like he tries to be a comedy AND a parody of a sitcom at the same time. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well made, but in my opinion they do not always get 100% of the bizarre humor they should present. <br /> <br /> I personally think the show needed some characters that were more common for the show to work. In South Park you have Kyle and Stan, which are a kind of realistic touch in the most absurd universe. I think that's what makes South Park work. You need some healthy characters that you can relate to in a realistic way, and that makes things insane a lot more interesting as well, because that forces you to take them seriously on some level. If everything is archetype and stereotype, it is difficult to include emotionally in the program, which is really Thats My Bush's biggest problem. Kyle and Stan are characters from South Park who give meaning to the insanity of the show. We do not have anything like this here, and this show suffers from it. <br /> <br /> Another point of support is Parker and Stones flirting with the Republicans. It's the only thing about them that I do not really understand what they are trying to do. Not portraying Bush as nothing more than an idiot and idiot character from Homer Simpsons is kind of subversive in a world where many people can not resist him and think that he is the worst president since Nixon, and a parallel comedy world of Letterman and So that just satirizes your every move ... but it's hard to understand if Parker and Stone really mean anything. It's how the joke is on us, but somehow it does not hit the target. It sounds strange, because it does not remind you of the real Bush. <br /> <br /> In addition, I really found the show very enjoyable. Some of the jokes here are hilarious. The pro-life proponent who was an aborted surviving fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes for them in any program. And the show is packed with great stuff, and sometimes it's insanely funny if you use your head a little while watching.
