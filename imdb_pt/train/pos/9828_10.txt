I'll be honest with you ... I liked this movie. It's a great action-packed zombie movie, original ideas, good acting, but it's also packed with zombie bad effects. Part IV, titled "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of horror movies like this must check out the Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp and other Full Moon Pictures .
