If the Lion King was a Disney version of Hamlet, then Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is a Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz are Dead. Like Tom Stoppard's captivating film, we can see the action from the point of view of two of the original characters: Timon, the meerkat with a fall for music and a pumba, Boar with flatulence problems. Following their story - not Simba's - we see why all the animals bowed when Simba was introduced to Pride Rock. We discovered what made Timon and Pumba decide to follow Simba back to Pride Rock to bring down Scar. And we discovered how they handled the hyena once and for all. Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes but he is ably supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumba. It's also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg replaying their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller lend their distinct voices to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device, which does not always help to progress in history. That said, there is a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie. With more laughter than any other Disney third-in-a-series movie, it's worth watching Hakuna Matata - even if only for the whirlpool scene that's still funny, though it's a little predictable.
