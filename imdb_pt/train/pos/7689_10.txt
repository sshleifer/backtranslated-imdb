That was how black society was before the epidemics of crack, gangsta rap and AIDS that plagued the ghettos in the 1980s. Decent, hardworking families struggling to survive and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. Black America was a different group of people in the seventies. Still full of hope and flying high in the civil rights movements of the sixties, times were hard, but it's still worth fighting for. Keeping your head above water, making a splash when you can, this show showed how the black society struggled to work together as individuals and families, before they started to attack each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos. It is heart breaking to see what the black ghettos were and what they have become now.
