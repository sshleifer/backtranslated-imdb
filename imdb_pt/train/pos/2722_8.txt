This re-creation of the infamous 1959 Kansas killings, based on Capote's book, is recorded by Brooks and director of photography Hall in black and white, giving the impression of a documentary. There are good performances of Blake and Wilson as the killers and Forsythe as a police officer who pursues them. The scenes that preceded the murders, filmed in the royal house where the crime occurred, with a soundtrack of whistling winds, are quite intense and frightening. Brooks drives with great enthusiasm and uses several interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it's a little too long, with the outcome dragged and somewhat boring.
