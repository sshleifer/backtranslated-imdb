The FBI story, told from Agent Stewart's point of view via flashbacks, intertwined with her personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are very good, just as Hamilton is a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story hinders involvement. It's like watching snippets of a dozen different movies as we glimpse who the gangsters are. Some of the episodes are very long, others very short, and some seem out of place (the sequel to Stewart's daughter's school). Overall, this continues for a long time. However, it is worth taking a look at their production figures.
