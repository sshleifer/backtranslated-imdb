It's been almost 5 years since the release of this elegant action movie. I've watched this movie almost 10 times and it's a big effort from Gautham. From my point of view, I feel that this film is virtually flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-no doubt..classy.Jyothika played her role as Maya very well. The character fits very well. The character who caught the attention of the film was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well.Brutal and fearsome .Jeevan deservedly received the best villain award at ITFA 2004. The supporting cast of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others performed well. <br /> <br /> Racy script, perfectly timed dialogue and brilliant narration by Gautham. Harris Jeyaraj are all graphic busters while the BGM fits the film very well.Cinematography by RD Rajasekhar is rich.Peter Hein choreographed the stunts as well.Anthony's editing is accurate.Moreover, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect full thriller of certain doses of action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood movies can not compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
