In any number of movies, you may find Nicholas Cage as a strong and silent hero, Dennis Hopper as a homicidal maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as vamp / tramp, and the late J.T. Walsh as the heavyweight. These are the kinds of roles these four can play in their sleep, and they did it often enough to see them reproducing them again in the cliché. What a relief, therefore, that John Dahl, a master at getting a little humor out of a little action, directed this nuanced Noirish thriller. Hopper manages to avoid going over, Cage shows a little more depth than his usually superficial action heroes, Boyle is sometimes sensual, innocent and intriguing, and one gets a notion of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction gives an idea of ​​the void of Big Sky's country where the story takes place, while being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled forehead can signal a radical change in the plot in the store. The plot twists are top-notch, and one of the other great twists of this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains. It is not often that smaller characters, such as vice-sheriffs, have more brains than their superior bosses. But with a director as smart as Dahl, you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything related to this movie. An excellent movie.
