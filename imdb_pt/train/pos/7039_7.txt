War Inc. is a funny but weird movie. The actors are friendly, the film is also nice, but I do not know how to describe the plot. I'll go on the plot later. This is a movie with some weird cast choices. In addition to John Cusack as a killer, we saw years ago in Grosse Point, in white, which I liked. <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff playing a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something. Your character is weird. There's a scene where she puts a scorpion in her pants. And hit Hauser (Cusack). There is a twist in the end involving the two characters. Makes sense. <br /> <br /> This is the only choice of cast I'm entering. Because that's just weird. The whole movie is weird. But sometimes incredibly funny and I never got bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Excluding Miss Duff. She's not great. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack and Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a killer named Hauser (Cusack). He is sent to a Middle Eastern city to attack an oil tanker named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). While trying to deal with his personal problems, he has to help out in the marriage of a pop star (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). There is one thing about the popstar though. Hauser is angry with her. There is a scene where she is singing a song for him and then he vomits. <br /> <br /> The turnaround at the end of the movie reveals the reason. The thing about the turnaround is that I kind of see it coming. But it does not matter. This is a strange comedy, fun and entertaining. I love most actors. So really, how could I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
