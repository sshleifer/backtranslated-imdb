There's so much value in this movie that it's hard to know where to get the compliment. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrait of Reese Witherspoon. That his performance stands out in the excellent cast is really a compliment. Robert Mulligan rarely disappointed those who admired his work. Each painting of The Man in the Moon is evidence of cinematic production at its best.
