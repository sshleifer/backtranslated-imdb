I've never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all the latest shows to shame, great time! Those who have never seen, what I do not see as possible, should see. It's a great show for anyone of any age. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will amaze you. It is true that some people think there are some "cheeky" aspects in the program, but the positive aspects weigh all the "cheeky" aspects. Full House published its first episode on September 22, 1987, titled "Our Very First Show" and debuted in the last episode on May 23, 1995, titled "Michelle Rides Again Part II." <br /> <br /> The plot of the show is very believable. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) loses his wife, Pam, in an accident involving a drunk driver. Danny has his brother-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is Pam's younger brother, and Danny also brings his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are called DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse plan to live with Danny and her three girls for a few months just to help and end up living with them for eight years; which is the number of years that the show has applied. <br /> <br /> Here's a brief description of some of the characters and the actor / actress who played him: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star hoping to give his big break. In Full House, John Stamos does a great job portraying his character. He looked and played music as his idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He loses his wife in a car accident involving a drunk driver. He has to raise three girls without having the girl's mother. Bob Saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): One word may describe Dave Coulier, funny. He is great. Playing Joey's character was perfect for him. He does a great job playing the stand-up comedian waiting for his big break. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She's a tremendous actress. She plays the older sister, DJ, who is short for Donna Jo. She's one of the best actresses I've ever seen. His ability to perform at Full House was very convincing. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, unbelievably incredible! I wish I could say everything I would like to say about Jodie, but I would use a maximum of 1,000 words just for her. She started out at a children's show called Mother Goose Stories and when she came to Full House, she blew the minds of the audience and the creator. His great looks and incredible acting ability helped make the show the success that it was. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie should be the star of the show. It was to be where she was going to get her big break. Jodie, at the age of five, when the show first aired, could hit every line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most children can not do this. As you can probably imagine, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is where they started. They took Michelle's part because they were the only babies who did not cry while they were in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> There are many other cast members who should be recognized. These are the original characters from when the show first aired in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is how Full House became The Michelle Show at the end. I think it was focused on her in the end. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were a lot better at acting. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. That can teach you a lot. One of the greatest things you can teach is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy occurs, such as losing a family member. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all that said, there are only a few things to say; Full House will never die, and thanks to the cast of Full House, for giving everyone a show they can enjoy.
