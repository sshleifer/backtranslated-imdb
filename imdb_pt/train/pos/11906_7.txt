This documentary about schlockmeister William Castle takes some cheap photos in the naïve environment of the 50s and 60s, in which he did his most characteristic work - see the funny and silly people with ghostly glasses - but he is also affectionate and lively. , with particularly brilliant commentary from John Waters, who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time, and Castle's daughter who adored his father and is also quite insightful about how he handled his craft. (We never found out what happened to the other sons of the Castle.) The movies were not very good, of course, but their marketing was brilliant, and he seems to have been a sweet, hard-working family man. Fun people continue to appear, such as Diane Baker from "Straight Jacket" who looks great, and Anne Helm, whom she replaced on the initiative of star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman almost burst out laughing with the happy memory of working with Castle on "The Tingler," and there are enough pictures to give us an idea of ​​Castle's talent level - not loud but very energetic. A nice look at a time when the public was more satisfied, and that leaves you nostalgic for days of simpler movies.
