Is this the future that awaits us? A wasteland overpopulated and unforgiving, with an infernal and unwanted existence? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly since the film was released in 1973. Let's hope the world does not end this way ... Soylent Green is a wild movie that I really enjoyed. It had nice characters, a semi-apocalyptic scene, a compelling and thought-provoking plot, and the macho macho man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film an unpleasant and dirty feeling. You are almost suffocated by the stench of the city and its filthy inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who became one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of tough, but still tough. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's place. He sees that something is not right, but everyone around him either does not listen (more like he gets paid not to listen) or wants him to die. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the lovely Sun, who has had enough of this unpleasant place. Everyone is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes with the apartment she lives in. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic even for 1973. The Soylent Green Factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "spoons" (tractors that get rid of people) were excellent. The polluted air on the outside looks disgusting and very unpleasant. The empty streets of the city full of vile and rotten people are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> One final note is the ending, which still shocked me today. It's awful, but if you think about it, that's a good idea. <br /> <br /> The conclusion: <br /> <br /> An excellent 1970s science fiction movie that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uncomfortable.
