This film shows life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young Frenchwoman, the French Dalens, whose father is a colonial government official (French) and whose family is one of the few white families around. It gives an idea of ​​what life was like for both the settlers and the natives they associated with. It's a consistent sense of another film I've seen about Africa in a similar time period (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the movie - but the plot is understated. The viewer is left to draw their own conclusions instead of having the filmmakers "forced into it," although the framing of the story as a flashback of the woman's visit to south-west Cameroon as an adult provides some perspective.
