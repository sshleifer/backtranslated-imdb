Purple Rain is a great movie if you are a lover of music in your early 40s who played Prince in the 80s. History is a widely used formula: the rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find its public and self-respect. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U, is worth watching. He is himself and as a showman, as powerful on stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, about Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, a former pupil of Prince, is beautiful and shows some acting and chemistry talents with Prince, but her script does not get her far. Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements.
