Charming, romantic, innovative and fun. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unmatched, surpassing the well-known "death romances", like the Ghost. Although we intuitively know that Peter and June will find supreme happiness at the end of the long staircase, joy is on the journey. The moral of the story, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve this victory is thrown into a celestial arena of sweeping vision and thrilling grandeur. With more than 500 costumes properly portrayed in various eras and cultures, the vision of the directors of the sky remains memorable six decades later, far in the CGI era. <br /> <br /> However, for the entire cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the lowest level. The wonderfully determined and romantic aspect of "Stairway" is captured with utmost simplicity: June's tear, preserved in a rose petal. <br /> <br /> This film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages.
