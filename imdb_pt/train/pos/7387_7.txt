The events of September 11, 2001 cast their shadow over this Oscar awards ceremony with a minute of silence before the assembly in memoriam and there was little in the way of singing all the dance comedy extravaganza that we expected of it. prize show, but this was by no means a bad thing. Entertainment was more or less reduced to a LOTR send up with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson and that was it. The rest of the show was resumed with clips of the nominations and I have to admit that this was actually nicer than the exaggerated numbers of music and dance we've seen over the years and Whoopi Goldberg was not a bad presenter unlike the esoteric himself David Letterman a few years ago and the quiet minute of the September 11 victims was scary and dignified. <br /> <br /> As for the awards, New Zealand was absolutely stolen. The FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four minor awards, while THE BEAUTIFUL MIND underestimated most of the major awards except the best actor, who should have gone to a tough New Zealander, but it was for an all American guy. The only Oscar awards I have agreed to, other than those presented to FELLOWSHIP, were the awards for best supporting actress and best supporting actor, both so-called correct.
