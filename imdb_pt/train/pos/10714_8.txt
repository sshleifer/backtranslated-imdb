The Scots are excellent at telling stories. The traditional type. Many years after the event, I can still see in my mind an old lady, the mother of my friend, recounting the Battle of Culloden. It makes the characters come alive. His passion is that of an eyewitness. One for the events on the swamp heath about a mile from where she lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, it happened many years before she was born, but you would not guess the way she says it. The same story is told in bars the extent and width of Scotland. As I discussed this with a friend one night in Mallaig, a local cut to give his version. The discussion continued until closing. <br /> <br /> Stories like this become part of our being. Who can not remember the stories our parents told us when we were kids? They become our invisible world. And as we get older, maybe they still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir. Fact and fiction blend with aspiration, models. Warning stories. Archetypes Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, like my grandfather and grandfather before him." Our protagonist introduces himself to us. And it also introduces history that goes back to generations. Produces stories within stories. Stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of Scotland, its steep mountains shrouded in mists. The material of the legend. However, the Seach'd is rooted in reality. This is what gives you a special charm. It has a rough beauty and authenticity, tempered with some of the best Gaelic songs you will ever hear. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather at the hospital shortly before his death. It burns with frustration. Part of him yearns to be in the 21st century, to leave Glasgow. But it is created on the west coast between a Gaelic-speaking community. <br /> <br /> However, there is a deeper conflict within it. He longs to know the truth. The truth behind his grandfather's old stories. Where does fiction end? And he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> He is drawn to make one last fateful journey, to the summit of one of Scotland's most inaccessible mountains. Can truth be told? Or is it all in stories? <br /> <br /> In this story about stories, we revisit bloody battles, poisoned lovers, the folklore of the old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth. In doing so, each of us connects with Angus as he lives the story of his own life. <br /> <br /> Seachd: The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably Scotland's most honest, unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film ever made. Like Angus, I got a little annoyed at the pretense of hanging stories on more stories. But also like Angus, I forgave this once I saw the "bigger picture." Forget Braveheart's box office pastiche and stuff. You can even renounce the just-famous dramatization of The Wicker Man. To see a film that is true to Scotland, this is probably unique. If you meditate a lot on this, you may even reevaluate the power of the narrative and the old question of whether there are some truths that can not be told but only experienced.
