Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant. Skillfully scripted and delivered to perfection, this parody of students and teachers at a South London public school leaves you literally laughing. It is vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. The characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of British society (or, to be precise, any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "protagonists" for lack of a better term, the show does not shy away from parodying every conceivable subject. The politically correct flies through the window in every episode. If you like shows that are not afraid to sneer at any taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!
