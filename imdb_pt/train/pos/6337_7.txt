I've had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for over 40 years, since my 5th grade teacher, a native Texan, told stories of who he saw in his youth. Fortunately, I have lived my entire life in the mid-Atlantic states where tornadoes are rare and generally not as violent as the Midwest but I have had two close encounters, one in PA and one in NJ in the past decade . <br /> <br /> I liked the familiar scenes, particularly the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was near, Dan knew a lot about what to do, and he probably learned it at school because I know that hurricane safety is a major issue in parts of the US where such storms are most frequent. However, the characters in the movie have done two things that some people think should be done or are safe to do in tornadoes, but which should not really be made or are unsafe. <br /> <br /> When the siren sounded for the first time Dan and Arthur went through the house and opened the windows. For years, this is what people have said to do, but the tornado safety websites now do not recommend doing it. In addition, people were shown hidden in an overpass of the highway. This method was popularized by a video of the early 1990s made by a TV crew during a relatively weak tornado in Kansas. However, in the more serious ones, people can be sucked into these subterranean passages. This happened during a May 1999 outbreak in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> The tornadoes in this movie happened in the fall, which is not an ordinary time for them to happen. (Then again, one of my closest encounters happened in late September.) In addition, they traveled from the northwest to the southeast, while most storms in the northern hemisphere go from the southwest to the northeast. However, this is not so unusual. A famous tornado struck Joliet, IL in the early 1990s, it traveled in that direction (as well as what happened in my next upcoming meeting). <br /> <br /> I think the film should have been filmed in the spring. . This movie was based on a book which, in turn, was based on a real event that happened on June 3, 1980. But it was still a convincing story.
