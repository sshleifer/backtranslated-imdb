Wow!! I've seen so many bad low budget movies lately, but this one is great. The very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the East German coast is a stark contrast to other crime films or series. I loved the lead actress and the absolute rejection of any prevailing clich√© about the police. This film is realistic as a documentation and fun as a drama at the same time. A perfect exchange!
