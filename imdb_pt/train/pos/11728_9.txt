There are two things I like about Elvira, and both are bigger than her and she keeps them covered up: her wit and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show how funny it can be or how it commands the attention. Looking like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits the property of a distant relative only to find out that she is really the heiress of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been a lot scarier and creepy. It's mostly fancy food with so many references to horror films, like the mob or the fleeing heroine who stumbles and stumbles on his heels. My favorite part is when she uses her wonderful skills to break the chains by keeping her locked in the graveyard. The ending is sweetly sweet as if written by the Bradys, but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this kind of movie.
