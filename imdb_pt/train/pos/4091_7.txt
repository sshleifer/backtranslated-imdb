I saw this movie in a London cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since. I found it hilarious. I loved the originality. It's rare for anyone to make such a movie - and it's also sad. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that once I read a book called "The Black Hotel" - and as a movie fan, I always "picture" books as movies. Kind of 'fit' them, you know? But as I read, I thought, well, that would make a great movie - but of course it would have to be "adapted" - to the point of having little relation to the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, well WHY? Of course, it could never be shown on Sunday afternoon on TV, but since it was shown in theaters for ADULTS, who knew what it contained, where is the DAMAGE? Damn it, my civil liberties were being squashed here. A director must be able to make a literal film adaptation of "The Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, adult movie censorship should not exist. But unfortunately, although I accept that with INTELLIGENT adults, such freedom may be harmless, there would always be those who would not have the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality, and who could be incited to commit obscure acts. <br /> <However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" falls into this category. <br /> <br /> In his appearance in England, the British censor dismissed the problem. Despite the relaxation of nudity, given the theoretical theme of the film of bestiality, if the censor had passed ANYONE, he would be looking for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> BUT ... in those days, there was an alternative. G.L.C. This was a local council with a department that had the power to pass a film only to London where the public was considered to be more "sophisticated" than those who lived behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> The film was duly submitted and PAST. However, it later emerged that the "council" consisted of only four people - three who voted, in addition to a "president." And on the day, one of the voters was sick. Thus, the two remaining voters and the president sat down to see "La Bete". <br /> <br /> One of the voters said, like me, that the movie was hilarious and would hardly encourage the indecent actions of ANYONE. The other had no imagination and simply found the piece disgusting. And the president did not understand, so he decided to err on the side of FREEDOM. <br /> <br /> When the missing voter finally saw the movie, they also found it disgusting, but it was too late! The film received its "X-London" certificate and opened the mixed reaction. G.L.C. The movie censorship board was dissolved shortly after! So, "La Bete" only opened in London by what could be better called FLUKE! But I'm glad it was. It's great! If you have not seen it yet, do so. It's a fantasy and as such is much less disturbing than most of the things you see on the news these days ...
