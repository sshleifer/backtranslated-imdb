Critics are dumb. This movie is funny and clever. I really loved this movie. Why does everyone hate this movie so much? I wish people would love this movie more than they did not love it. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and devote a lot of work to make this movie. I do not see you out there making movies like them. So people should just watch and not comment. I like this movie. Okay with all that. There are parts that are stupid, but at least they have. Jerry Stiller would love that because this movie has the acting as the King Of Queens show. But that's better than that. I can not believe this was rated so low.
