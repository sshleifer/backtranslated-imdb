Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Living in the 1920s in Ireland, Gypo and his Irish counterparts are part of a clandestine rebellion against the British oppressors. One particular rebel, wanted for murder by the British, secretly returns to the city. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the Â£ 20 reward is very tempting. Gypo kills his friend and plunges into a pit of desperation and drunkenness. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are searching for the informant. Immediately, Gypo, with money burning a hole in his pocket, is his prime suspect, but they, who are his friends, do not want to believe. The story of The Informer is simple in its plot, but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It's easily one of John Ford's most engaging movies. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his sad character, and there is a lot of sympathy that comes from him. The script is very full of suspense too. It's the kind of suspense where we're sure we know how it's all going to end, so we have to grit our teeth and endure it. The acting is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who has starred in many of Ford's films, probably gave his best performance here (and won an Oscar for it). All the other artists in the film deserve their praise. In addition to an incredible screenplay and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionist films. I love the darker side of Ford. In his humor, as well as in his themes, The Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); is also somewhat similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940) in these respects. 10/10.
