Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notch ... I highly recommend this movie. His performance, in my opinion, was Oscar material! The only sad fact here is that Universal did not make this movie available in any video format, either on tape or DVD. They are ignoring a very good movie. But Universal has little regard for its DVD library, which is sad. If you get the chance to see this somewhere (do not know why it rarely runs on cable), see! I will not go into the story because I think most people would rather have an opinion about the film, and many "reviewers" spend hours writing about the story, which is available anywhere. <br /> <br /> 10!
