Pre-adolescent mood is present in large quantities. The acting and the story are wonderful if you can tolerate the concept. Those with weak constitutions will have some difficulties, since the "worms" are realistic enough to cause more than a few of the audience's agitation. <br /> <br /> Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg stole the spotlight, but young Ty Panitz could spend serious time on the screen for years to come. <br /> <br /> Miss Eisenberg developed from a cute face to a strong young actress, with charm and a wonderful comic delivery. <br /> <br /> History does a spectacular job of dealing with bullying, friendship and justice. It creates an opportunity to discuss these topics openly and frankly, while recalling a "rough" scene from the film.
