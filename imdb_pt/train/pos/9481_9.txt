Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie, not only in the year it was filmed but also now. It is an art film that is not outdated even in the 21st century. The director maintained a good narrative ability and thus made the story so smooth! <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of the French movie of the new wave: "Femme d'a cote" by Fran√ßois Truffaut, which is of the similar topic. .
