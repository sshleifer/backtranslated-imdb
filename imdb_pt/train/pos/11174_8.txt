Probably the most accurate adaptation of Stephen King yet. Not surprisingly, since the king himself wrote the script. The story follows the Creed family moving to a beautiful home in Maine. One of the other locals is Jud, a nice old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that runs through the front yard. The other is a path that leads to Pet Sematary, where children have for decades buried dead animals on the highway. Soon, Ellie Creed's cat, Church, is found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, with the exception of Louis (the father), is absent on Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another cemetery, in addition to the Pet Sematary, where the Church is to be buried. Later, Louis is received (not so politely) by the Church. He came back, looking as if he had come out of the bag in which he had been buried. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more I can say without ruining the story. <br /> <br /> Of all the adaptations of the king I saw, that would be the most terrifying. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a great job driving the process. Suspense is kept relatively high throughout the film, in part due to the development of the plot. The scene in which Gage is dead will stay in his mind forever. So, of course, we have the conclusion. Easy to determine what will happen, but Lambert makes some really scary and sometimes disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie and an excellent adaptation. If you like to be afraid and do not mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images, then "Pet Sematary" is exactly what you are looking for. Non-terror fans will want to avoid this.
