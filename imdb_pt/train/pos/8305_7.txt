I really enjoyed the movie, however, I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things going on in his life. First of all I was not aware of Lucille. There is very little (hardly any) mention of women being intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in your life today there is no mention of any involving females in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of your life was not mentioned. Overall, the movie was great. I also did not like Leon playing the role of Little Richard, he is a good actor, but I feel that part of should have been for a different actor. Visually, he did not remember Little Richard. I was also totally unaware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was a part of. From the film he was portrayed as a sex addict. In today's time, he would be referred for counseling for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I do not want to ruin the movie for someone who has not seen the movie, however, there were several things about the movie that I feel should not have been part of the final cut.
