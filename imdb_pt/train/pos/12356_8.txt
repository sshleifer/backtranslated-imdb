Contrary to the summaries of some people, the women portrayed in the film are not geishas. They are oiran (prostitutes) who live outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of women of the Tokugawa era. I can not say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm is in how typical they are. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the direction of art and acting. I felt like I was having a glimpse of a time and place that I could never glimpse. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to watch. I would only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of Japanese culture, or for those who like calm and emotional stories. It's a great example of both.
