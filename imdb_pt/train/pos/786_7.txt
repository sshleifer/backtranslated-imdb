Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are great again in this movie. When you enter 40 and have been single for a while (or your entire life), you may feel you are losing. The film is a sweet reminder that love can be found anywhere if your antenna is actively active. I liked the quick sexual encounter, which must be out of character for a normally booked school teacher (MacDowell). Her ex-student is cute enough, still carrying a crush on her teacher for so long. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I found quite unrealistic or impractical. For example, in a scene where the envy of other women and a scene was created to make Andie MacDowell dump the young man, would a mature cop (MacDowell's other friend) allow her friend to do such a sinister act? Is it so easy for someone not to stop in front of a car? Of course accidents happen all the time, but I was hoping to see the heroine marrying happily with the first man she got involved with (that was the hardest part to believe in! For such a beautiful woman to be single for so long ??) ... Perhaps filmmakers are aware of the fact that many novels between an older woman and a younger man do not last long. In addition, they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public, especially to jealous women over 40, who are waiting for some miracles to happen. The sad ending with a glimmer of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet, but if the man continued to live, would that last? For how long? Nobody knows. However, it's a movie to make you want to watch it again some time later ... a year later, maybe.
