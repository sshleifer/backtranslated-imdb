... and the series leaves you forgetting all that. I am about three years older than the children portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage and got my first college graduate job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 1970s were really a terrible time to be young - inflation, competing for the minimum - jobs in his mid-thirties, horrible music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that this series does not ignore any of this and still manages to make the 70's look fun even for those of us old enough to know better. He can look directly into the '70s - complete with authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hope of youth and the things that make high school and college years the best and the worst. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers of the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - really have dreadful parents with the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 1960s finally arrived in the suburbs during the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who had been expecting the 1960s to show their whole life in order to legitimize their strangeness. Friends of Eric, Fez, Kelso and Jackie, complete the group representing nerdiness, well-intentioned incompetence and snobbery, respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he received even when these cards are given by largely absent and careless parents. I recommend all eight seasons, even if the eighth season is a bit late because of Eric's absence.
