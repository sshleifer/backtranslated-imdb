I was looking through the movie listings in my area on yahoo and saw a movie that had not been advertised. I looked closer and noticed that Peter Falk and Paul Reiser were in it. Having watched "Mad about you" once, I was not a fan of Paul Reiser. However, I am a big fan of Peter Falk. Then the wife and I had a chance. We were both involved in this story. The beautiful landscape, the sincere acting and the sense of family and moral values ​​that are rarely seen in the movies and in the world of today. Not that emotional junk, but the real-life situations of real people. I even have to say, Paul Reiser was great, though, I still will not watch "Mad about you". I do not know where this movie went. I heard it was released in a limited version. It must be shared with the world. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. M.
