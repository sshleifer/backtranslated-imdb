This is a great movie, I did the piece a while ago. He had an extra zing ... for that. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and also Jason Alexander has a good voice. It was great. The scenery was also very good. Except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, it makes it very long. Overall I give 8.5 stars. They also added some parts, but it was still cool.
