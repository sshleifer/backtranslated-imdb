We were so lucky to see this fantastic movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. Upon entering the theater, we received a small opinion card that would be used for our personal evaluation of the film. Looking at the card, I turned to my wife and asked, "How many movies in your life do you think can qualify as magnificent? Just about 5 for me." But then, noticing the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser while watching the spectacular scenery on the set in New York State, I slowly began to hit the movie in one category at a time. Certainly it was nice but the totally natural repoire of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who unfortunately will probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing detective rather than this movie, the film jumped to excellent level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my heart, usually stoic and insensitive, melted like the Grinch's and I ended up giving a superb. <br /> <br /> This photo is a must for anyone who has parents. No violence or nudity, but some strong language.
