"Hate of a Minute" is undoubtedly one of the best movies coming out of Michigan in recent years. Not to say it's a brilliant movie, but definitely worth watching. "Hate" recounts the sordid adventures of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio), a previously abused child, now grown up. up, and beginning to hear your evil side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is very good visually. The shots are creative, and the lighting is appropriately unstable and interesting to look at. This movie actually has an element of production value to it, unlike other recent Michigan releases like "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies". Subtle dolly shots and stylized shooting composition show good use of the $ 350,000 budget of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, "Hatred" stumbles in the same places as so many other local films, and this is in the history department and character. Essentially, things just happen. Eric Seaver does not evolve anything. Basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are beginning to realize. The movie just wanders along its joyous path with very little development. Also, the ending is very abrupt. <br /> <br /> However, since this is a horror movie, since when do we care about the plot? We just want to see people die, and "Hate" certainly delivers. When the body count was mounted, the people in the theater began to cheer "Kill it! Kill it all!" When people yell back at the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is where "Hate" succeeds. It's fun. And in the end, that's all that really matters.
