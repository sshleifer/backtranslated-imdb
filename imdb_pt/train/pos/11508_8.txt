I would love to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show quickly went from scary to suspense. Blame it on ABC. They changed the show for Friday nights at 8:00 a.m., then known as the "family time." I should never have been on Fridays in the first place. I was in junior high school and I loved the first episodes! It was the first against Police Woman on NBC. ABC had huge issues with Friday nights. Bad season for them overall until Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT debuted in January 1975. Kolchak should have been a success. Darren McGavin begged to leave his contract to end the show. Too bad the writing was not until Richard Matheson in the original TV movies. Still, McGavin made Kolchak alone, as actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind. That INS set with the manual typewriters and the clacking teletypes seems old-fashioned and old-fashioned today, but that was part of the appeal. They were very lucky to have Simon Oakland reprise "Vincenzo" of the TV movies.
