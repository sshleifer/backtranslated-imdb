Scott Henderson, the engineer employed by Carol Richman, as his assistant, insists on calling her "Kansas" every time she talks to her. This shows us that Carol, actually played by Ella Raines, is supposed to be a baby in the woods, with regard to the Manhattan of the 1940s. Only a woman from out of town followed the somber barman to a lonely elevated subway. Even so, only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak directed this film noir very well. It shows a talent to infuse history with a lot of raw sex that was amazing for those days. How else could we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the musical, where Scott leads the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such an obvious passage for a lady on a date? The drummer played with high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. does not hide his desires for any of the girls who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays. It was a true explicit invitation, first to the "ghost woman" of the story, Fay Helm; then Cliff, the drummer, openly insinuates to Ella Raines, who goes to the theater disguised as the mysterious lady that his boss had originally taken. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will catch any viewer from the start. There are things that are not explained but hold everyone's interest. The killer is not revealed until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an underrated actress. It holds against much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a theater actor in New York, working in Hollywood, never found the fame he deserved in this medium. He is effective as the accused's best friend. On the other hand, Alan Curtis appears as a man who, when framed, accepts his fate and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loved him. Thomas Gomez, like Inspector Burgess, is a trump for the film as a detective who has his doubts that the police caught the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This movie will not disappoint.
