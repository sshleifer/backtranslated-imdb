Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an ordinary man who feels that God is messing with his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course giving someone the powers of God could worsen. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good as always Morgan Freeman is first class and looks like God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although they sometimes overreach Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie really portrayed God, not only that, but also as a black man. I thought it over, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene, for example, others miss the target, but still a good movie. 6/7 of 10
