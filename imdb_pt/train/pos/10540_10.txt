I can only agree with meter that this is a fantastic movie and should be seen by a wide audience. The imagination on display, the visual interpretation of the script, the mood is constantly surprising. The two tracks are great and really carry the movie. My advice would be to either watch a trailer, just rent the movie and watch it with no expectations. I rented from blockbuster, so it's readily available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it but I think most people will have an opinion and that's always good, unless it's just 'that was stupid.' I loved this movie, you can not see gem so every day. This should become a cult favorite. Try, you can feel the same way I do.
