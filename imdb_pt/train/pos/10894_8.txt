I had some reservations about this movie, I imagined it would be the usual account - a formula movie about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heatwave in late June, we decided to give it a try anyway, maybe we could see a bit of snow. <br /> <br /> This movie ended up being a laugh after another. Ben Affleck believed in his character, but the real star is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with real intelligence about him and made a great "father". <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good couple of hours, definitely take a look at it.
