In today's world of digital manufacturing, there is no computer that can replace the actor and the writer. Unfortunately, this kind of "character-driven" movie is very rare nowadays. Duvall's performance, as well as James Earl Jones, are faithful to the high expectations of his audience. I wonder if this movie was made for TV? It has a personal "close-up" to the narrative. It is a euphemism to say that the performances are excellent. The only thing that keeps you from being a movie masterpiece is the lack of a great director of photography, but beautiful pictures are not everything. How can talents like Jones and Duvall continue to produce such a good job in a time when actors pose for digitization?
