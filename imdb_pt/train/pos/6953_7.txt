This is one of those movies that make better trailers than full-length movies. The concept was very cool and different, the mood was unique, I felt there were missed opportunities to put the "punch" in this movie. So many lines and jokes were hanging for a long time, without a definite end and really did not leave me laughing. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were great. Wanda Sykes was underused in this movie and needed more exposure, plus more opportunities to turn your character into more time on the screen. 7 out of 10 for me, more of a DVD rental. Also, I was looking for some kind of good music video during the final credits, something that became a kind of brand for these romantic comedy movies, la la Something About Mary, Meet the Parents, but again, I was left feeling a little cheated by the fact that this could have been a much better movie with a little more music and punch lines. It looked like it was thrown in theaters.
