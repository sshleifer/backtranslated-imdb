A beautiful postcard from New York. The thing I liked the most was being able to watch this with my entire family and did not regret waiting for a stupid bathroom humor joke to show up. This never happened. My teenagers liked it too. My son by Natasha Henstridge and my daughter by Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember the last time we could sit with the kids and everyone enjoy something. This film told a story that looked comfortable, but not old or made. The end came with a twist we all liked too. If you are not just a cynical person and are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you. As a guy it takes a lot to keep my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did. I recommend and we need more of these movies to watch.
