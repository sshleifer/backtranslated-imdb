I saw this movie first on the way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. The film itself, I believe, is a masterpiece. It's the kind of movie that people should do. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors in the world. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost the taste for life until he reaches a man with Down Syndrome who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The actors, including the actor who actually has Down Syndrome, create a friendship and a credible relationship between these two unlikely men. The life of Daniel and ours forever changes with the man with Down syndrome. He realizes that life is not just work and not play, but for the living and loving and that's what life should be. The ending is kind of silly, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring a tear to your eye.
