<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's funny if you do not get the referrals as a direct comedy. <br /> <br /> I did not see much of the much-hyped CB4, but what I saw did not have the heart that this little shaker has. <br /> <br /> I have not heard of the people involved since then, which is a surprise. The movie is a lot like Spinal Tap, which is not bad, and I think a lot of the dialogue, while invaluable in Tap, is funnier here, probably because I'm more into rap than rock, so my own <br /> <br /> Rap songs are funny as hell, and it's basically the reference for most of the movie, not all of them are in-your-face, which means physical comedy and one- liners takes priority over takeoffs. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, one to watch twice if there ever was a movie.
