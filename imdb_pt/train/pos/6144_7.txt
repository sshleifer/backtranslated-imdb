I saw this when in The Wonderful World of Disney as a child, so I do not remember much of it. As I watched recently, I sat there thinking, "This is the strangest thing I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> The scenes of "traveling" look like something caused by an overdose of LSD. The animated characters are mostly versions with strange colors / voices of the Jungle Book characters and Robin Hood. Some things not so Disney that I noticed: children being threatened in knives and prostitutes (during the music of Portobello Road). <br /> <br /> It was a lot of fun, although the musical numbers were long and I could see little. children getting bored with them. In addition, the subject matter was somewhat murky, since it was defined during World War II.
