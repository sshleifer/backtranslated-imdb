The first movie was good, but not as good as the wonderful animated classic I found most poignant and captivating. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Of course the slapstick is too much, the script has its weaknesses and the plot is a bit uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. The film is good to see with the stylish photography and the costumes of popping the eyes (especially Cruella), and the music is pleasant. The acting is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is attractive and Gerard Depardieu, while he gave better performances he enjoys himself as an accomplice of Cruella. But the best asset, as it was with the first film, is the incredible Glenn Close in a deliciously exaggerated performance as Cruella, even more evil than before. Overall good. 7/10 Bethany Cox
