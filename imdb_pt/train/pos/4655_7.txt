Peter Ustinov plays a crook who has just come out of prison when the movie begins. As soon as he leaves the gates, he immediately begins working on a scheme to once again make a stealing package, although this time he has his eyes sharply defined. This is really one of the weaknesses about the movie, since he apparently does not know anything about computers (few did in 1968), but manages to become a computer genius literally overnight! Okay, right. Either way, he creates a scheme to pass himself off as a computer expert and get a job at a large American corporation, so that he can eventually divert a ton of money. Considering that his knowledge of computers is rudimentary, it is incredible how he puts forth a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and its defenses. But, after all, it's a movie, so I managed to suspend disbelief. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) are able to get away with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, it gets very, very confusing and Smith announces she has managed to accumulate more than two million by investing in the companies that Ustinov started (although she did not realize they were all fake companies). This should mean that eventually those actions she bought are worthless. What they seem to imply (and I might be guessing wrong here) is that Ustinov and his new associates quickly cashed the shares before it became known and thus the stock would become worthless. Either way, the movie seems to post in a magical ending where no one is hurt and everyone is happy - and that just does not make much sense. It's a shame, really, how the acting and most of the writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were simply wonderful. <br /> <br /> If I seem to have interpreted the ending, let me know, as the film seemed very vague in detail in the end.
