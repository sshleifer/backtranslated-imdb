With all this happening in the world, sometimes we need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. It is not a complicated plot or a deep meaning; however, it is not devoid of substance. There is more than a furious action or heart-pounding dramas. There are small shows that you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy your date. Try it you may like it more than you think. The little girl is very smart and cute. "Daddy" and the girl go through some routines of clowning. When a jealous boyfriend comes on the scene, the problem infiltrates Curly and the life she knows can be torn apart. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play good roles, and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting tale, like a duo portraying homeless homeless. Their worlds collide and comedy goes on.
