Dirty Sanchez is the most radical British version of Jackass, in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) strive to hurt and humiliate each other. The reason this show is better than Jackass is because most of the action scenes are not planned, which makes the reaction a lot funnier. There are 3 series of the show, the first follows around them and takes a look at their lives, for example. There is an episode about their love lives, jobs, etc. The second series tells boys to experiment with different occupations. The third follows his European tour. It seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses in the series. In my opinion the third grade is the best, but trust me when I say, if you have a week of stomach, do not look, because you are slightly to see a good amount of blood and vomit in each episode.
