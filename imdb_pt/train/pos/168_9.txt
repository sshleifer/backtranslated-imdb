This is one of the best Talkies by Joan Crawford. It was the first Gable-Crawford pairing, and made it clear to MGM and the public that they were a bustling crew, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars. <br /> <br /> The film convincingly describes the slide down of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the collapse of the stock market, must defend and work for a living. Life is hard in the Depression, and even then even your attempts to find legitimate work are useless and resort to the activity of the underworld. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is excellent as the socialite turned moll. She is intelligent, complex and believable. It still tempers the theatrical rigidity of the acting style of the other actors. Clark Gable is a diamond-in-the-rough, masculine and rude as the no-nonsense gangster who engages with Crawford's character. In the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role alongside Norma Shearer in "A Free Soul," securing his position as a male sex symbol at MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this kind of role, do not miss "Paid", which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best performances at the beginning of Talkie. <br /> <br />
