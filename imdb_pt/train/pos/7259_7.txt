How can the rating of the viewer for this movie be only 5.4? Only the lovely young Alisan Porter should start automatically at 6 when you decide your rating. James Belushi is good at it too, his first serious good role, I had not liked him at all, but about last night until that. He was very good at Gang Related to Tupac as well. Kelly Lynch, you have to love her. Well I know. I'm just wondering what happened to Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue a 7
