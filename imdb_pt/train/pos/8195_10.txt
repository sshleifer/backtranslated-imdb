Sudden Impact is the best of Dirty Harry's five films. They do not come any thinner and meaner than that, as Harry goes through a series of violent confrontations, with bad guys getting their fair desserts. Which is just the way I like it. Great story too and cleverly directed by Clint himself. Excellent entertainment.
