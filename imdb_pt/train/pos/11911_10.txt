The Yellow Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations. Barry Jones and Kenneth More are great at supporting roles in characters who both have more to them than what they see. Jean Simmons is very good, and Trevor Howard makes a thriller hero fascinatingly out of the ordinary.
