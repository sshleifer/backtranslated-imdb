I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on DVD and had no idea if I made a bad or good purchase. It's the end result to see the whole movie from start to finish. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), "BloodRayne", '05, gave a great performance and her appearance is beautiful, sexy and at the same time a true study in the art of how the performance is actually performed. Diana did not like her domestic life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave his mother. She decides to do boxing training at a local Brooklyn gym and is not well accepted by male boxers. At your school, there is a lot of friction between your classmates and the boys. There is a lot of action in the ladies' bathroom and references to private parts of men. If you like boxing, and see a sexy hot girl do wonders in the ring and beat the boys in your you know what, this is the movie for you.
