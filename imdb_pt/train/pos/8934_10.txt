Two things haunt him throughout L'Intrus: who is the intruder and is it a movie or a dream that you are watching? The ending is so shocking that for a while you can not answer any of these questions. The intruder appears as different characters, different men in different circumstances who do not belong to the scene, then are expelled, gently or brutally, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a despicable man. He has rude manners, some bad, heartless work. He needs one and goes after him. He has a transplanted heart and then decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in his quest for redemption? Such a guy could cut his throat with the fall of a hat. You know that, but Claire Denis does not encourage you to judge him. Occasionally, there is a young Russian girl - a beautiful girl who seems to dwell somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges her. She may even punish you. But not Denis. There's the character played by Beatrice Dalle who does not want business with him: do not touch me, she says. But Denis lets this man be himself, films him in his self-absorbed pursuit. I do not know if what she films is the heart or the mind, but it's not the traditional basics of the plot. Whatever she films, you get in the end. You know who the intruder is, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your mind with all their meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
