Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate that by putting me in Gundam and anime in general. However, after watching his predecessors, such as the Mobile Suit Gundam, the Zeta Gundam and even the G Gundam, I find the Wing Gundam Lite. <br /> <br /> Characters: One aspect of Gundam is having your characters plunge into difficulties and grow into maturity. This does not happen in the Wing. Heero is the best dog in the beginning, and he is the best dog in the end. Personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is for all purposes a hero for most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: The Wing has great suit designs. The Gundams are super cool, with Epyon being my favorite. I even consider some of OZ's costume designs on par with some of the classic Zeon facts. But tuxedo designs do not save the series of boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cool fighting scenes, though full of recycled animations but with superficial plot and character development. Pleasant, but not moving like the previous Gundam exits.
