The story of the first television broadcast of "Columbo" is simple: half of the team of successful mystery writers ends up with another, fits an invisible mafia group, is blackmailed by an admirer, takes away the admirer and is deceived by the robust Columbus . That said, this is still one of the most entertaining in the series' history, benefiting tremendously the work of the late Jack Cassidy and the star Peter Falk. /> In addition to the notableness of being directed by a young Steven Spielberg, the episode also has a macabre air because of the future of two of its stars: Cassidy and Barbara Colby. The two share several scenes together and it is touching that both would tragically die within a decade of this footage, Cassidy in a fire in an apartment and Colby in the hands of aggressors, yet to be found after more than three decades. <br /> <br /> Now, both cases are MYSTERIES of real life!
