This movie was fantastic and even with an unconvincing ending, it's still worth seeing. The film begins when Claudette Colbert is about to marry Robert Ryan. When the minister asks if anyone has any objections, a guy jumps up and announces that Colbert can NOT get married because she is already married !! Colbert insists that this is not true, but when they investigate they discover that the justice of the peace and many others remember their marriage and even there is a signed marriage license! Slowly, it becomes evident that Claudette's mind is slipping and the people around her seriously doubt her sanity. Then, when the supposed first husband is murdered, all evidence and suspicion falls on Colbert. <br /> <br /> The film is an exciting thriller of mysterious suspense, since what I have described so far is only the first half of the film. . What follows is incredibly intelligent and captivating. Unfortunately, the conclusion, however, is a little disappointing, since the guiding force behind it all comes "on the left side" - and it's disconcerting, since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer. However, despite this, the film was so good that I can even excuse the flabby end. In particular, Robert Ryan did a great job as the "knuckle-busting" fianc√©, although in addition to him the other performances were also excellent.
