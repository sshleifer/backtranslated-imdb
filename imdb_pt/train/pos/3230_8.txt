Okay, so Soldier is not as deep and meaningful as Blade Runner or as big as Terminator 2, but overall I found it very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The fact that Kurt Russell has remained in the character not speaking and being virtually without emotion has made the moments when his humanity has broken with more poignant. I found his depiction of restricted emotional development more compelling than Arnie's in the T-movies (and before getting comments, yes, I know Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human, but the premise presented by the two films was the same). > <br /> So for the film itself, a reasonable US / British cast is able to detail this little story. I'm not sure if Gary Busey and his two helpers were evil or goodies, so I could not decide whether I liked them or not. The colony was a little more realistic, nor a sullen band of peace-loving / gullible / cowardly who are exterminated, nor a group of aggressive paranoid subversive terrorists over the inhabitants of the world and with each other. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and unlike other reviews I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures!). Sean Pertwee really left his late father proud while continuing the families of the fine line of science fiction. And the rest of the cast helped to give shape to this pathetic flock of people taking full advantage of a bad situation and not going too badly. <br /> <br /> If you see this on TV programming, I would recommend giving it a try. I do not think you will be disappointed.
