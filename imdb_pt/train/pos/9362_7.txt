Greetings again from the darkness. How rare it is for a movie to examine the lost souls of men in pain. Adam Sandler stars as Charlie, a man who lost his family in the tragedy of September 11, and has since lost his career, his reason for living and undoubtedly his sanity. Don Cheadle co-stars as Sandler's former roommate in dental school who seems to have the perfect life (which Sandler apparently had before September 11). <br /> <br /> Of course the parallels in these men's lives are obvious, but it is really refreshing to see the feelings of the men on display in a movie ... other feelings than lust and revenge. Watching them really help themselves just by being there is painful and sincere. Writer / director Mike Binder ("The Bright Side of Anger" and Sandler's accountant in this film) really does look different to the movie. Some of the scenes do not work as well as others, but overall it's well written and solidly directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are excellent. Sandler's character recalls a bit of his great performance in "Punch Drunk Love," but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle is always well and does a good job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by watching him work on a puzzle. <br /> <br /> Supporting work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in an oddly attractive role), Donald Sutherland as a judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws. <br /> <br /> The film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected a man so deeply that he is basically ruined. Besides the interesting history and some great photos of NYC, you have to love any movie that contains the vocals of Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder going through Daltrey. It's not exactly an upbeat movie, but it's a quality movie with an unusual story.
