The movie shocked me. Personally I had mostly bad buzz flock. Well, finally, after owning the DVD for months, I put it on a sleepless night. although the film dragged the extra footage, it was purposely used the seriousness of their passion and their recovery from the addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out all the scenes. The best thing about the movie is the consistency with the relationship. There were no ex or characters threatening the relationship. I mean, we usually see the girl meet up with the boy for some surprising twist of fate, they date, something we've seen coming up, separates them, and then they meet again in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow this mold. We actually experienced the relationship and it is flawed, and although the characters had anti-love moments, they did not have dramatic breaks if they left and did a set up every 15 years and then they would meet again in love. I did not feel that the film was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies. The story was unique and true to reality the way I felt those people in the movie were the most believable I've seen in a modern-day romance movie. And it did not hurt that all baseball games were real and they were in the real-world series, so fate kicked in there a bit too. It's not "My beautiful lady," but it's a witty and honest movie. I'll simply say that I liked it.
