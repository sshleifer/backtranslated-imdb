This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla, the Chicken are out of college and starring in a musical that they are trying to get on Broadway. After failing miserably in production, they all separate and go their separate ways. I love the characters and cameos. The songs from the film are "Together Again," "Look at me, here I am", "Saying Goodbye", "And I'll always love you", "Rat Jazz" and "He'll make me happy". "Frank Oz directs this film in an excellent way and all the actors do a great job acting like the Muppets are real.
