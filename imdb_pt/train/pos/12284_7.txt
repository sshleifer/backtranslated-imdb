I could not understand why Jeremy Irons found it necessary to display a very disconcerting accent, pronounced through clenched teeth and the back of his throat. In fact, that spoiled the movie for me and distracted me from what was probably a great performance from him (very annoying). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent, and although I have always rated Jeremy Irons as an excellent actor, I would not rate this film as one of his best. The film, however, whetted my appetite, as well as some of the other comments made about this movie, which I found very interesting, and now I want to read the book.
