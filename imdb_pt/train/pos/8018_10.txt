In this movie of the Muppets, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical Manhattan Melodies to Broadway. Unfortunately, no producer will meet the Muppets. After being denied by many producers, Scooter suggests that the Muppets decide to move on alone. However, Kermit still believes he can start his Broadway show, but after he finally does and let everyone know that he has sold the show, the Kermit amnesia get and the others do not know where he is. <br /> <br /> This features many great scenes, including a live action sequence that featured the Muppet Babies, a wedding sequence filled with Muppets, including the cast of Sesame Street and Traveling Matt (from Fraggle Rock) Scooter as a movie theater and a scene in which Rizzo and the other mice cook breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters were not included. Of course, many of them appear in the wedding, but there must have been some significant roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this movie as if it were the last season of The Muppet Show. and The Great Muppet Caper, and Foo Foo, Miss. Piggys, should also be with her (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also played by Steve Whitmire, played a major role in this film, and he was not very well known at the time).
