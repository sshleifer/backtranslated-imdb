"Most of us at least inhabit two worlds, the real world where we are at the mercy of circumstances and the inner world, the unconscious, a safe place where we can escape ..." With these words, Mr. "The Maxx", a fascinating world where fantasy and reality combine. Inspired by Sam Kieth's comic books, "The Maxx" is very loyal to the material in which it was inspired not only in history but also in the graphic style which looks like the pages of the comic book, giving this show appearance surreal and unique. But also, the story is interesting and fun. At times, it can become very weird, but when you enter, it's hard to get out of it. The story and the characters are beautifully developed. The music blends perfectly with the style of the show and gives the atmosphere appropriate. Unfortunately, like many good animated shows, this was short lived. "The Maxx" is a must see. It's one of my all time favorites.
