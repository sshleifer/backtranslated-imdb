The Woman In Black was a British movie made for TV, which was broadcast for the first time on the BBC on Christmave Eve '89, and again in '92. I believe he did a round on American TV at A & E. It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 1990s, but it went out of the way. A US company released on DVD later, but that version also ran out. According to the site of the book's author, the rights to the movie now belong to someone else and will not be released again, and that unofficial bootlegs are being sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> I first heard about this movie recently on a message board and had to take a look. I found a copy on ebay for about 28 dollars. Admittedly, it's a fake from a Far East salesman, though the DVD says "Made in Canada," ha ha. But it's a good copy, and you can not blame pirate labels for releasing things that are rare, exhausted, and lost in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. It is a period piece set in the 1920s, with all the authentic and picturesque British settings of the time. The woman in black is very atmospheric and dark. For the most part, the film is very discreet but effective and scary. There is no self-indulgent gore, violence or much of all special effects, but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments. It's a classic, stylish ghost movie. The film itself looks like it could have been made in 1930 except for the color. Without all the flash of all modern horror movies, I'm afraid this movie is always a lost jewel. For me, it stands as one of my all time favorites.
