I hope the score has changed so far because of my brilliant and impressive review that convinces you all to watch the movie, thus creating an instant "8" s chorus, the real soundtrack to this movie. <br /> <br /> mentioned before Chris Rock is the king! Before watching this movie, I was not so obsessed with him, but now I'm knocking on the doors of Chris Rock's website begging him to watch me as his protégé. This movie is really funny, if you do not find this funny movie you really need therapy and it's humor that reaches all areas of society including race (predictable), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy .. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> There was a slight disappointment to me. It was so, when entering this film, did not realize that it was in fact a remake of "Heaven Can Wait", another very good film made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such, I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and all of a sudden the plot began to turn out to be distinctly similar to an older movie that I had seen on television a few weeks ago. Regardless of this movie, in my opinion the best version of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty at any second of any day of any week of any year ... you get it. <br /> <br /> Well, for the real plot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not ruin the experience for yourself! Do not read the plot! Just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that have driven you crazy, go see it because it's the funniest thing you'd have seen in a long time, go and see why it's a movie experience this does not lets you mumble ad nauseum to the cost of movie tickets. Go see why it's a good movie!
