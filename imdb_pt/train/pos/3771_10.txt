1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time: TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. Of the two, I've always enjoyed BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT The day is best done, but there's nothing like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it's hard to think of a more comedic duo than Bill and Ted. They are unique. <br /> <br /> Apparently influenced by the O.C. of the National Lampoon. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in Los Angeles in the 1980s. The two quickly began writing a screenplay about two shortly before was born the EXCELLENT ADVENTURE OF BILL & TED. The film, filmed in 1987 and released in 1989, became a blockbuster and instant cult classic. It was not long before the work started. Stephen Herek, the director of 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE' was not interested in working on the sequel, since he considered himself to be very stingy and unlike the first, so Peter Hewitt, making his film debut, was brought in to direct the film. sequel Could not have been a better director for the job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is beautifully directed. It is filled with your own unique style and energy that can not be combined. <br /> <br /> What makes BOGUS JOURNEY one of the best sequences ever is that although it's darker than the original, it's just so much fun. It does not change the characters like most sequences. Bill and Ted are the same adorable characters they were in the first movie. That's because it was written by the original writers. Most of the sequences are not written by the same writers of the first, but as 'BOGUS JOURNEY' had the same writers, it turned out to be as good as 'EXCELLENT ADVENTURE', if not better. Like the first one, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is absolutely hilarious, well written, entertaining and, above all, original. It's full of spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. It is an unforgettable journey. 10/10
