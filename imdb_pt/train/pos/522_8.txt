A wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish one from the other. Beautifully filmed and acted, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think while I watched and then.
