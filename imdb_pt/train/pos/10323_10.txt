This is a really fun movie. Some of the reviews I read in this forum were written by people who apparently think the film was an effort for serious dramas. It was NOT SO DONE .... It's an extremely nice film, done in an ironic way. All the actors are obviously having fun while having fun. The fighting sequences are lively, lively and, above all, not free. The so-called "Green Death", used on some occasions, is not, as I read in a review, "horrible." A couple of critics were very critical of the martial arts fight between Doc and Seas, near the end of the movie. Hey, light up ... Again, I remind everyone that this is a fun movie. Each phase of this "fight" was subtitled, which contributed to the fun aspect. The actors were not trying to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts movies. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and is the perfect choice to play Doc. Another nice touch is the unique way in which the final destination of the "bad guy" (Mares) is dealt with. I promise you that if you do not try to take this movie very seriously and simply watch it for the value of entertainment, you'll spend 100 minutes in the most enjoyable way possible.
