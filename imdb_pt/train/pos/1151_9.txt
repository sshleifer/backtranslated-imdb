'Soapdish' is one of the best but least remembered comedies of the 1990s. The film revolves around the various off-camera dramas that take place behind the scenes of a Daytime Soap Opera, produced at low prices. The first of several strengths of the film is the fantastic cast of A-List. 'Soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of her era. The film is superbly led by Sally Field as the neurotic aging actress Celeste Talbert (She makes a tantrum when put on a costume that makes her look like "Glory F * CKING Swanson! "). Your supporting cast is like a who-who of 90's Movie Greats! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy all raise the film a lot. Goldberg is predictably excellent, while the performances of Downey Jr. and Hatcher suggest the comic excellence they would later achieve. <br /> <br /> In terms of writing, the film is excellent. There is a really modern limit to the script, which goes astray in wonderfully bizarre on several occasions. There are also several visual jokes that are well ahead of their time. In a way, the film is reminiscent of Mel Brooks at its best and often reminded this reviewer of 'High Anxiety' (1977). Much of the film's humor depends on daytime television performances and neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, the casting session with executive explorer played by Carrie Fisher is hilarious and honest. <br /> <br /> "Soapdish" is, for my money, one of the best comedies produced by Hollywood in the 1990s. It's a great script and a Class A cast makes it a must-see. It's hard not to love this movie after you've been laughing for 90 minutes.
