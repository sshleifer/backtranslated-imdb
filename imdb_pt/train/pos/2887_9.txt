Cinderella is one of Disney's biggest movies, one of those movies that I think you appreciate the more you're older. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I consider the film the biggest of its films at the time of its release. The characters have become more dimensional than the previous films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters that Disney has ever created. With her gentleness and dry humor, she is extremely nice; however, it is the inspiration it provides, which makes it memorable. Like many people, she is a dreamer without end, and she keeps her dreams, never giving up. Even in the most adverse situations, her dreams endure, and she does not let anyone take it from her. Your example should serve as an inspiration to all and encouragement to never leave your dreams.
