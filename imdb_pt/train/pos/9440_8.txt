"Deliverance" is one of the best exploration films of the marvelous 1970s, where so many other films came from. <br /> <br /> A group of friends go out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies that practically try to ruin their lives. It's incredible. <br /> <br /> We are treated with anal rape, violent beatings, archery murders, shootings, broken bones, etc ... Much like the "Electric Saw Massacre" of 1974, to say that "Liberation" is believable would be immature. This never could and never could, even in the dark ages of 1972. "Deliverance" is a very fun and action-packed ride. It's one in a huge stack of exploration films from the early '70s and (arguably) top of the stack with his great acting, excellent cinematography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 children.
