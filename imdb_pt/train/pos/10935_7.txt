Well, I must say this was a funny movie. Despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty tacky, and there were some weird moments when the movie seemed dark blue for no apparent reason, I was not disappointed. The story was really very interesting: the last member of the Poison Clan must track down the other five members and find out who among them is using their skills for evil and who is using them for good. The problem is that during training, all clans were masked, and everyone, since then, returned to society in disguise and changed their names. <br /> <br /> Fighting is a joy to watch, as every member of Venom has a different fighting style: frog (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. The fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place, and fortunately the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all the action. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of the film is that the story tends to drag a little in the first half to the first fight sequence. But take it, and you will not be disappointed!
