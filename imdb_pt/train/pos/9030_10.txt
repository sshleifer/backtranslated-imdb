This movie caught me by surprise. My friend told me that this movie was a "girl movie". Boy, he was wrong! This movie has a great family appeal, no sex scenes like other movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job on the shoes of Homer Hickam. The support cast is great too. <br /> <br /> Science, maturity, family quarrels, a great train scene ... This movie has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is presented in a very agitated way. The music of the 50s takes the film to the limit of greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD is definitely worth its weight in coal. The replay value is great - I've seen this several times.
