"Hey Babu Riba" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed "Esther" after a famous American movie star), and four young people, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop, all aged 15 to 17 in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, jeans, or anything that looks American. <br /> <br /> The very close relationship between teenagers is poignant and, finally, a sacrifice is made to try to help one of them. the group that fell into unexpected difficulties. In the wake of the change of communist policy, they follow separate paths and meet again in 1985 (the year before the film was made). I liked the movie with some reservations. Legends for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were several dialogues that had no subtitles. Maybe the rhythm of conversation demanded this, but I could not always read the text and absorb the scene, which made me not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and none of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative. <br /> <br /> This film of Yugoslav adulthood effectively transmitted the sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal ties among teenagers. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing to the end about who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what really happened. <br /> <br /> I would rate this 7 out of 10, and would like to see other director's films, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
