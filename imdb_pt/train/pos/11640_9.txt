What I liked the most about this film is that, like the Hitchcock films, it's a thriller that does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understood that people go to the movies to have fun. Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten about in recent years. This is a thriller, but it has lots of laughs and it always has a blinking eye for the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is wonderful as ever. Cillian Murphy is scarier than he is in Batman Begins. In the old days, there were guys who always made the bad guy. We do not see much of this nowadays because I suspect Hollywood agents would consider it a bad career move, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> The direction is amazing and elegant. The story is good, but the dialogue could have used some embellishments. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a very entertaining film and people were applauding when the final credits began to appear. If you're in the mood for a nice escapist thriller, "Red Eye" might be your ticket.
