I rated this as a ten just because I find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera. It's not epic, but it's very engaging and I've never been bored. If tens of millions of dollars can get into the countless bad movies that are dumped in bulk, give that director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know I'll queue at the local movie theater for their first big release. Very good job, well worth the money. What a script! It may be a low budget, but it hits half the top photos I've seen lately. Nanavati knows how to tell a story, both in writing and on the screen. Congratulations to her, I can not wait to see more.
