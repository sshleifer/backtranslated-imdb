I remember this movie from many years ago. Certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. The fact that I vividly remember much of the film after so long attests to its impact. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to comment on the level of performances because of the language barrier. But they were, however, very powerful. <br /> <br /> This subject continues to fascinate us even as the years go by. And it was treated more effectively here, with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I wish it were shown on TV at least once. Or at least be available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Any art movie files accumulating a copy of it?
