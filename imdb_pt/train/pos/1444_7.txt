*** SPOILERS *** When Undercover Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano, would find his drug dealer Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn in a buy-and-munch operation, with Tito being the only one who was arrested, that things went awry with the two Det. Santos and Tito end up being shot and killed for each other. During the deadly shooting, an innocent bystander of six-year-old James Bone Jr., Jaliyl Lynn, was also killed in the crossfire. With New York scheduled to host the 1996 Democratic Presidential Convention that summer the last thing the town's extravagant mayor, Pappas, Al Pacino, wanted was a possible revolt over the tragic death of young James Bones by one possible, it was later determined that it was a bullet from Tito's gun that killed young James, a member of New York. What was much more shocking until Bone's death was that his murderer Tito Zapatti was given probation by respected NY State Judge Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When should I have been arrested for 10 to 20 years being stuck with a pound of cocaine in the back seat of your car! It soon became apparent that the person who got Judge Stern's job for a $ 50,000 reward was not from Brooklyn's political boss, Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It is Anselmo who is involved with Mayor Pappas in a land deal involving the New York Subway System that would bring him and his real estate friends tens of millions of dollars over the next two years! It would also indirectly connect Mayor Pappas in the murder of bones by linking him to Judge Stern, which made it possible for Titus to be free, to be a common friend of his and his Gomba, or of Frank Anselmo's Landsman! <br /> <To keep all this from blowing up the late Det. Santon is framed, working disguised, without the authority of his superiors, in the shooting of the Bone. In fact, Santos players go there and hide about $ 40,000 in cash at their summer home, making it seem like he was being paid by Uncle Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francoisa, for letting his nephew deal with drugs with him . of the action. Which may well explain it, just like Tito being shot by Tito complaining about his payment to Santos! <br /> <br /> As things turn out, it's Deputy Mayor Pappas in the City Hall Kevin Calhoun, John Cusack, who finishes. spoiling everything for his boss by being too honest in finding out who was responsible for covering up Tito's criminal record that allowed him to be on the streets. The facts that Kevin discovered led directly to Frank Anselmo, a great political supporter of Mayor Pappas, who, as it turned out, was attached to the hip to Tito's mafia boss, Uncle Paul! A little exaggerated "City Hall" shows how corruption in the big city can seep down as well as down to everyone in the city without them, like Mayor Pappas, even knowing that. The Mayor's biggest sin was that he was friends with Brooklyn boss Anselmo, who was putting people in jobs, like Judge Stern, who were blackmailed by the real boss Mafioso Paul Zapatti of Anselmo. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** It took only a deadly shooting in Williamsburg to get everything moving not just for Tito, but for Det. Saints and James Bone, being killed, but why he was allowed out on the street to overthrow the very popular mayor of New York. Mayor Pappas was anxious for much greater things, like the governor or even the president, in his future political occupations. As it turned out, his best assistant, Kevin Calhoun, by not looking the other way, was responsible for his death. As well as that of the good friend of the mayor, Frank Anselmo, and of the person he helped put on the bench, as state judge, Judge Stern. Those who made the decision to leave Tito Zapatti from outside made all this disaster, which resulted in at least half a dozen murders and a suicide, it is possible!
