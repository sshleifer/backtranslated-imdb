Offside is the story of teenage girls trying to sneak into the stadium to watch the World Cup finals soccer game in Tehran that could lead Iran to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. Women are forbidden to go to the stadium by law in Iran, although many of them dress like boys and sneak in. Stadium guards search everyone at the entrance to make sure no one carries fireworks, and of course; no girl enters. <br /> <br /> Like most of Panahi's work, the performance of his armor cast was superb. You really think you're watching a documentary. The dialogues between the girls and the private people were executed with delicacy and surprising verisimilitude. The film portrays the interactions between the captives and the recruited guards who are serving the Mandartory away from their family and friends in a fun way. In the end, the public realizes that there is no such difference between the girls and the guards who were just following orders.
