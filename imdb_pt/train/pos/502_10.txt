Okay, this is coming a few weeks late, but it's here. Primarily, this is because of statements of various negative natures. Starting with technology. When Star Trek: TOS worked, special effects technology was extraordinarily low, and more than that, the team had little money to make any kind of mock-ups. In the 35 years since the debut of TOS, the Star Trek team has become a specialist in economics. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, they decided, quite rightly, to abandon the look of TOS and reverse engineer TNG et al. So if they decided not to make the golden glitter conveyor or did the stage guns look closer to Star Trek II? As for the nits that were chosen on the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it was presumed based on comments made by Kirk and Riker that the Earth only met the Klingons in 2200. Nothing was firmly established. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise gives us the most promising site of exploration we have seen for some time. This is what Voyager COULD have been. No series can evolve without some inconsistencies, but thank you that Star Trek has so few. So stop grabbing and enjoy.
