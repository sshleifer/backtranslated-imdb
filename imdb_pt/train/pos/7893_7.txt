I think I'm part of the silent minority who liked this movie. Is it one of the best in the "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I really enjoyed it. Freddy Krueger reaches his evil and malicious potential. As parts 4 and 5 delayed the series, I felt that the so-called final installment ("New Nightmare" is the true ending) took the series from its downfall. There are some great nightmare sequences, including one in which Breckin Meyer plays a drug addict who is destroyed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. This is a highly original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see it out of the landscape of dreams, jumping like Super Mario. And Freddy sings the fun frontline, "great graphics." And since the film was made 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddy started controlling the game with Powerglove. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Lisa Zane is perfectly climbing the lead. I have not seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man", and I think the last time I saw the movie was about 5 years ago. He is another great underrated actor who has a powerful onscreen presence. And who can forget the cameos? The best of them is Johnny Depp (of the first "Nightmare") playing a spokesman for a drug bill. <br /> <br /> The 3D sequence at the end is really amazing! So for those who want to check out this movie - rent or buy it on DVD! I hope all issues come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has the 3D element removed. <br /> <br /> I personally have not seen too many things wrong with the movie. He even worked out Freddy's background story. The film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the rough effects are great. Could that have given the franchise more justice? Sure you could have. But Rachel Talalay did a great job. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> And to finish, I loved the assembly over the initial credits. Fans of the series will be delighted, and will look upon it as a tribute to the beloved Freddy. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (of 10)
