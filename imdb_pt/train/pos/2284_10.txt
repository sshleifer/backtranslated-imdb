This is very creepy and, for the most part, a well thought out drama. I'm very impressed with the film, not just because of the plot and excellent acting, but that such an original film was made. Most films involving a spy or a war are filled with a talking British or a powerful battle, but not this. This is not about this kind of war, it's about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, posing as a defender of an evil that no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will return home as a hero, but his true heroic stance must remain a government secret. Returning to the United States, Campell meets with Nazi supporters and Nazi enemies, providing interesting conflicts both internally and externally. Nolte more than takes the part, and fits nicely into the plot for what he is asking.
