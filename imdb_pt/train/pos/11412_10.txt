Sympathetic and cleverly interpreted by the two girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is a bit of the imagination. Young Hazel running for mayor seems out of place, to be honest. <br /> <br /> Although the acting is well done by all involved, the film tends not to have a genuine atmosphere of drama. Maybe we've come to expect a somber reality in the movies, rather than comparing Pollyanna to How Green Was My Valley! No matter, every one of them is good in his own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright even though her role is somewhat subdued here. The middle of the road is a suitable entertainment for younger viewers, and sometimes it's good to be exposed to good classical music, which is almost a rarity! <br /> <br /> I think this film is a welcome change as it reflects, weighted values ​​for years of growth and no violence thanks to God. A warm family movie to enjoy.
