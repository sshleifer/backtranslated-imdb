Even though there are no new episodes, and this is rarely shown. I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the teen witch. I've never been able to see the last few episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles, or Josh? And why did the aunts have to disappear forever from the show? I'm sure the ending was perfect. But there are many unanswered questions. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! Because I heard she decides between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope she chooses Harvey! And I can say that Nate Richart is HOT !! Too bad he's too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show, but there are lots of "stupid" little things for the show, like how famous bands come out of nowhere and play music and the whole cast is listening, its kind of music. Stupid. In addition, the cat starts to get really lame, as the show continued, the jokes started to get stupid, and the things that the audio-controlled target audience would laugh at, I thought I was so dumb. Do not get me wrong, in some parts it was funny, but I think the show simply lost its "magic" so to speak while the show continued. I congratulate the entire cast for trying, although that girl from Soleil Moon Frye did not like it, and she was a horrendous actress. I wonder what Melissa or any other cast is doing now, now that the show is over.
