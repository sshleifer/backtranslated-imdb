I love bad movies. Not only because they are usually as entertaining as "really" "good" movies (like the Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood movies), but they are usually a lot better than these movies. And that's the reason why I love Italian cinema from the 70's and 80's. And that's the reason why I particularly love this movie, The Barbarians & the Company. <br /> <br /> Director Ruggero Deodato made some really good movies, such as Park's House on the Edge, as well as his Atlantis Interceptors. and live like a cop, die like a man are nice action movies. But this is too bad. The barbarians is such a stupid movie. Peter and David Paul as the Barbarian brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny, because of their lack of charisma and acting skills. But if they can not act, they scream and shout every time they do something important. In one scene people try to hang the Barbarian Brothers, and they escape in an extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad special effects, very stupid story, bad direction, in fact everything is bad in this movie. I can not describe how much I laughed when I attended the first time. The Barbarians & the Company is a classic camp that everyone should see once. If you thought Plan 9 From Outer Space is fun, that will be a real killer.
