This has been one of my favorite adaptations of an Austen novel. Although definitely not in the same category as the spectacular "Pride and Prejudice", "Emma" is a lush and relatively faithful version of Austen's novel - especially considering its short size. The biggest change between the novel and the film is good, since the unnecessary snobbery that Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced by someone much more like Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsale walks the fine line between youth and social snob with a grace completely lost in the 96 version of Gwyneth Paltrow. Samantha Morton's blond and soft locks suit her attitude and character, since the sympathy that accompanies her role in the earlier characterizations is replaced by Harriet we know from the book. Mr. Knightly's role is accomplished extremely well in my opinion; Both the seriousness and the gentle compassion with which the hero is painted in the novel are present in this film so neglected and sumptuous.
