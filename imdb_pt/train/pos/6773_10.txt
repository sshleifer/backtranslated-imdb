I got this movie on TV last night and you know that Danny Masterson was a good actor in the movie, and it's great to see you in something different from that show from the '70s. The movie is not rated, but in my opinion I would rate it R) just because of the nudity and abundance of adult content. But in spite of everything, I thought Dirt's Wisecracks were pretty funny. It's just basically about a guy who has no job, girlfriend or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more of a messenger actually.) He is molded for the murder of a rock star and girlfriend Rock Stars is one of the people who really need to help you. I give it to you .... *** 3 stars.
