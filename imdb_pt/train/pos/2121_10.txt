This is a beautiful movie that is beautifully represented by all the players. This will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The end of the movie fogs me up every time. If you want to see a great movie, that's it. Jimmy Stewert provides a wonderfully witty performance and Frank Morgan as Mr. Matuschek is spellbinding. The diversity of Morgan's characters is nothing short of incredible. William Tracy as Pepi is fantastic comic relief and offers some of the most important films lines and performances. Felix Bressart offers a fantastic performance as Perovitch, a clumsy worker who has the ambition to please those with whom he works. It's a simple story of how close co-workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love with unusual circumstances.
