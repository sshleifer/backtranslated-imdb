When I first saw this movie, I was with my father. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, it instantly became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A river goes through It's about two brothers that each one takes a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the oldest of the two brothers and he is on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the younger, rebellious brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. The film follows these characters as each one goes his own way. <br /> <br /> There is no downside to this movie. You will be entertained all the time. The acting, direction and script is all perfect. The two things that are exceptional are cinematography and score. Both of which hold you in the world that Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that is meant to be a classic. It sure is in my book. If you have not seen this movie yet, watch it as soon as possible because it will stay with you forever.
