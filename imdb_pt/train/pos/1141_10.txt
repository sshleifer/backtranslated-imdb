Whoever did not laugh throughout the film was embalmed. I've watched at least twenty times and still have tears in my eyes in many of the scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect as Celest Talbert, a faded soap star whose supporting cast is trying to replace her in the hope that her own star will rise. Fields, at age 45, still has that wonderful, beautiful goblin quality and a perfect figure who claims to have had three children. I'm prejudiced, I'm in love with her. <br /> <br /> The cast of "Soapdish" is filled with stars performing their roles to perfection. Kevin Kline is flawless, just like Robert Downey Jr., a na√Øve Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in one of his early roles, Carrie Fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on. Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the unfortunate costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as nanny Nan, who leads the plot to take the character Fields out of the program, is hilarious. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been awarded the Oscar. best comedy star, best comedy star, and a myriad of other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses. Grab the DVD so you can watch it for the next 25 years. You will still be laughing when the disc wears off.
