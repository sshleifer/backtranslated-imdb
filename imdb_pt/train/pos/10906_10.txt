I have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never got a chance to meet him, but I never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much the drafting of this program has helped his fellow sufferers, raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man touched people in a way that millions of charity leaflets could not. I believe this should be mandatory in schools. I also agree with other comments - what do I have to complain about? He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to maintain a sense of humor. God bless. I could not watch the part that showed her bandages being altered. I have enough problems with my son.
