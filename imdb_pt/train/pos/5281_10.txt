this is not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise', but it's a good road movie. He sets up his two main characters smoothly and easily. viewers quickly learn the underlying tensions, which is a tribute to the director. there is the young Frenchman (and English) who wants to get well in France, has a French girlfriend and drinks alcohol, parties as young people do. And there is his Moroccan (and French) speaking father who devoutly follows his Muslim faith, with the generosity and wisdom of the elders, and who rejects the new culture that surrounds him (like cell phones). the film could exploit very powerful policies - the strange couple drove through the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey and then through the Middle East to reach Mecca. these are areas where Muslim populations have been involved in wars, repression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators pursued torture and summary executions to maintain power and where religious communities are in constant mortal battle with one another. however, the film moves through these places and possibilities with only suggestions of such agendas. the relationship between the two is central to this film, and faith, politics, are the backdrop. seems to be saying that we are all human, and we need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world. It's certainly not 'Natural Born Killers' and it's even better for it.
