I love it when they really do a sports story well. So many in the past were so fake that it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely cool movie, an old-fashioned kind of story - and based on a real-life guy to do exactly what Dennis Quaid did in that movie. He plays a high school coach who is convinced to try, late in life, to speak athletically, to become a professional baseball pitcher. Eventually, he achieves his goal of reaching the Major Leagues, even if it was a brief period. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are cool people, like you twist, from Quaid to the players in his high school team, to your boy (Angus T. Jones, now a bit of a star on television.) <br /> Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike past actors in sports movies, he knows how to play a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who can shoot more than 90 miles per hour. And, most of this movie is true, as witnessed by the real-life launcher in one of the DVD documentaries. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a good and inspiring real-life sports movie, you can not go wrong with it.
