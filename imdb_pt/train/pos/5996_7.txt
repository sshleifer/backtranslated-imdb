Again and again, I have said that if people do not want to make remakes or sequences, they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent cinema. That being said, the last time I saw an independent movie must have been easy six months ago. So here is a review for an indie that I had my attention drawn to on YouTube; the Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately, you can say that the film is going for an avant-garde film approach that is telegraphed in its use of extreme closes, scopophilia and fast editing. You are proud of the way you look - and you have the right to be. For the most part, it's a nicely composed piece, save for an inexcusable disrespect to the 180-degree rule and a comically bad shooting effect, which is a phenomenon that seems to be the business card for self-funded projects. <br /> <br /> Still, despite these amateur mistakes, most shots are really a pleasure to look at. We are presented with good use of props and locations, good visual performance and a fluid and very atmospheric edition, which is more commendable, since it is something that you do not see very often from a YouTube submission. The plot is fragmented, and while the basic premise is fairly simple, some may find it difficult to follow exactly what is happening, but what we are seeing here is a vanguard story at work; you can not really expect a direct three-act structure, and if you do, you may not be prepared for that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Where the film is sadly disappointed, however, is the sound. What you will hear everywhere is a distorted voice that often seems insincere and worse yet is background music continuous, which undergoes a minimal change and does not add much to anything. So much attention is given to the visuals that the audio sounds downright neglected, and this really becomes apparent when you realize that you have lost only four sentences of the narration and have to step back to catch what has escaped your attention. <Br /> <br /> Then, give a clock, but do with the sound off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Did anyone else remember the cover of Doug Naylor's Red Dwarf novel, "Last Human," earlier in the movie? If you have the book, you know what I mean.
