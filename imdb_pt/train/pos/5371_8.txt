I entered my first comment about this movie almost five years ago. So the ideas presented in the film still seemed largely fictional, if indeed they could perspire. No longer. Now, The Running Man's politics, society, and media seem very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year The Running Man left) that are present today: <br /> <br /> Concern with, as Damon says Killian, Richard Dawson's character, "the traditional morality." VERIFY <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort on the part of competitors. CHECK <br /> <br /> Cameras everywhere. VERIFICAR <br /> <br /> Travel restricted to citizens at the whim of the government, controlled by a centralized computer system with passports with bar codes (travel passes in the film) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. VERIFICAR <br /> <br /> A growing crisscross, bordering the incestuous, government and media. VERIFY <br /> Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate images from real movies (such as the "matte digital" image of Ben Richards in the stunt). CHECK <br /> <br /> Detention of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration. CHECK <br /> <br /> The flag economy further widens the chasm between the rich and the non-rich; an increasing number of peripheral groups reacting to the tight knot of the big government; civil unrest sooner or on the surface of almost all large public events, regardless of their origin or intention. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> So again, maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novel. But just for safety, I'm moving to Switzerland.
