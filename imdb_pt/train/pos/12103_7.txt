I've never seen a Barbara Steele movie I did not like, and I've always been a sucker for a good haunted house story (especially for wonderful pictures like "The Legend of the House of Hell" and the original versions of "The Haunting") . "and" House on Haunted Hill "), so I had the feeling that" Castle of Blood "would be in my alley. Steele's horror, "Black Sunday," remains to this day, is, however, an extremely atmospheric and frightening entry into the ghost genre. a Lord Blackwood, and a writer named Edgar Allen Poe to spend the night at Blackwood Castle on All Hallows' night, when the spirits of the dead in the castle revive their fate. The film actually sends shivers down the spine of the viewer, and the uncut DVD I just watched - thanks to the good folks at Synapse - even features a surprising topless scene and a mild lesbianism! wonderful in this film; its supernatural beauty is harnessed throwing a sympathetic spectrum. His mere presence turns a frightening ghost story into something truly memorable. It was not for nothing that she was called "The Queen of Horror".
