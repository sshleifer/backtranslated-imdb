Saw this as a previous bystander by accident, I watched it twice now. I enjoyed it very much, no silly thought provoking messages simply good fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and a movie just feel good Highly recommended for those of us who just enjoy to enjoy movies and not dissect them Great fun for the whole family Here. I did not realize Rosie Alvarez is played by Vanessa Williams, she is excellent and very sensual. Songs like One Boy and One Last Kiss are really nice to hear and beating your feet for Jason Alexander is the complete contrast to your character in Pretty Woman ans is very good. Tyne Daley is still in my mind of Cagney and Lacey and his voice and accent still had this memory. Overall I just loved it and will be looking to buy it if it is available
