The film within the film - a concept often made in the history of cinema. This is done here, just like any other. <br /> <br /> If you love Carmen, you'll love this version. <br /> <br /> If you love flamenco, you'll love this version. <br /> <br /> The plot of classical opera is presented in the real rehearsal of opera by a flamenco troupe. The music is authentic. The direction is wonderful. <br /> <br /> If you like dancing, you'll love this version. <br /> <br /> There is tragedy. There is passion. There is intrigue. <br /> <br /> There is ... <br /> <br /> Carmen.
