The year is 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) does not like people. There is only one friend he has and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), a nice old man. They are driving a herd of cattle with them. The key to wealth. In Skagway they get into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) drives the cattle. Now Jeff just needs to get him back and take him across the Canadian border to Dawson. Now they have a bunch of other people. they like the ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). There the two men enter the gold business. The fourth collaboration of Anthony Mann and James Stewart, The Far Country (1954) is a beautiful western, in fact. The acting job is superb. Walter Brennan makes a great partner for Stewart. Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet is delightful. Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in roles children. It's fantastic to see how Jimmy Stewart overcomes all the problems on his way. There is only the man and his rifle. But he too is vulnerable.
