If you "understand", it is magnificent. <br /> <br /> If you do not do it, it's decent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "understanding" does not necessarily mean that you are gone through a school shooting. There is so much more in this film that sometimes school shooting becomes insignificant. <br /> <br /> Above all, it is a film about acceptance, both superficially - of a traumatic event, but also of people who are different for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie about unbearable pain, and how different people support it. In this case, the contrast between Alicia's anger and Deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of anxiety so palpable that in the middle of the film we wondered how the director could take a happy ending from the hat. Fortunately, the public receives credit for being human beings; our intelligence is not insulted by a sleepy, implausibly moralistic ending. <br /> <br /> Above and beyond, I try to keep my mind clear about movies being fiction and everything. However, I must admit, I cried like a lost baby during this movie. There were certain things about it that struck * very * close to home and opened some old wounds that were never healed. But this is not necessarily a bad thing.
