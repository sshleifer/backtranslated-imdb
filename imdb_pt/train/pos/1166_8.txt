The rough and lethal attack man Tony Arzenta (a soft and gentle performance of Alain Delon) wants to quit the murder business, but the dangerous criminals he works on do not let up. After his wife and son are killed, Arzenta declares the season open to all those responsible for their deaths. Director Duccio Tessari recounts the evolving story at a steady pace, maintains a properly serious and sensible tone, sets off thrilling shootings and thrilling car chases with considerable coolness, and punctuates the narrative with explosive explosive explosives. bloody violence. Delon's gentle, charismatic presence adds extra class to the already engaging process. This film still benefits from the performance of a pound sterling, with commendable contributions from Richard Conte as the wise mob boss Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as the friend Sandra de Arzenta, Marc Porel as the loyal friend of Arzenta, Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring as cruel, calculating the capo Grunwald and Lino Troisi as the poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitta. The brilliant cinematography of Silvano Ippoliti has several graceful pots. The soundtrack of Gianni Ferrio reaches the point of relaxation. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in cool parts. Better yet, there is no filler to talk about and we still have a decent dab of sexy nude female nudity. The surprising conclusion packs a medium and persistent blow to the intestine. A solid and satisfying winner.
