I love Korean movies because they have the ability to really (silently strangely) capture real life. I usually watch Korean movies just for that reason alone. I've seen these directors other movies before. What comes closest to the feelings I get from this is Oasis and another amazing movie called This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my resume of the title should be from a Christian perspective, so I'll start by doing this instead of just watering it with praise. For a non-Christian perspective, director Chang-dong Lee captured an unbiased and almost real portrait of a modern Protestant church (regardless of denomination), warts and all. I've always been waiting for a Christian movie that really portrays the darkest corners of church life. Because Christian movies tend to speak in a language that is different from those who want to share their faith. Many movies with religious touches, while good motifs, tend to have only the resonance of a Disney movie or a school special. They need to show life as it is. Real people curse, real people crave, real people fall. And while Christians believe that salvation is available to those who seek it, we are still challenged by the daily horrors of this life. And Do-yeon Jeon's character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrait of a woman who encountered God, but because of the bitter realities of life, she loses that love for Him that she once had. It does not deny that God exists. It's just that she refuses to accept living with the idea that He is a God who loves and forgives everything. <br /> <br /> In its decent to the ends of morality and madness, your character asks questions that are in the mind of each, religious or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is Love, why does He allow such terrible things to happen?" This movie does not answer that, rightly so. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the movie, while open to interpretation, leave us with a promising future for our main character and bring the idea of ​​the complete circle of "secret sunbeams". <br /> <br /> I do not know. I believe for a second that this movie tried to be religious or somehow tried and went to be that. There is the reason why it worked even more. It's real, it's honest. And because of that, it's by far the best summary of a real Christian life I've seen in the movies.
