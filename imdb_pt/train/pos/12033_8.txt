When I was flipping through the TV Guide, and I came across "Twisted Desire" in the movies section, I read your description. Three words caught my attention "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I find her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Witch" absolutely vile, I hate this kind of program, so I was thinking it would be a boring old man, A starring love story she ... I hardly knew. <br /> <br /> It finally started on television, I had my bucket ready in case I vomited because of your lack of babydoll or your way, you know what I mean. At first, you think she's just a normal, kind girl who's in love, but she has evil parents. So when you find out that she manipulated her boyfriend to kill her parents, so that she could be with her true love, you're like "Whoa." You just do not expect this type of role for this type of actress. She played her role very well in my opinion, I never expected her to be able to act like a slut, and voila, she did it perfectly! Congratulations to her, the movie was very good, I definitely watch again and recommend it to others.
