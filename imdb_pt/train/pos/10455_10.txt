This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" feature great portraits, these films discard unhelpful subplots and Hollywood disagreements. This film focuses purely on the observation of a beautiful novel. You never doubt for a second that the movie will lead to the romantic pair of these two people. You almost immediately feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just pure joy to see them find you. This film is mostly based on dialogues. But every conversation between them is also very intriguing. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. As with all this conversation, although it often does not matter at all about anything critical, you can feel the nuances as these two become more affectionate and confident with each other. This is exactly how you dream you know someone special. And what makes it so true is that it's not too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you were confident enough to start a conversation with this person that you noticed somewhere random. And what puts the cherry in this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna, in which this film takes place. This only increases the romantic nirvana feeling that the movie suggests. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I do not think I'm going to get bored of it.
