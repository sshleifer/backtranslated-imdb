After reading the book, I went through that DVD at Wal-Mart for $ 3 and thought, of course, hell ... I got the DVD and watched it last night. When I started watching it, I checked the execution time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, okay cool ... It seemed to run slowly, knowing the story and how much it was. When I got to the actual murders, I was like, "How much time is left?" Verified. "A minute? What the hell ?!" I felt incredibly mistaken, thinking that the film only advanced in a third of the general story. <br /> <br /> But fortunately I noticed that the scene selection menu of the DVD included a part 1 and a part 2. Still had another hour and a half to go! So I was very happy and enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more so than the first. <br /> <br /> I admit that I did not see the original 1967 movie (despite my sincere desire to do so). however read the novel and felt that this was a rather decent movie, for a two-part TV miniseries, that is. I think the cast of Perry's role was completely wrong and some minor inconsistencies jumped at me, but still very well done. The first half drags a bit, while the second half is much more exciting. I think they should have provided the film more like Capote made his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 later, and 1/3 after the killers are arrested. Instead, the movie does 1/2 more before the murders, 1/4 later, and 1/4 after the killers are arrested. Again, this makes the second half more exciting, but at the same time less convincing at the same time that the first half drags on and continues ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize that I just did the same. A mistake about getting things to drag on, so I'll shut up. Go watch the movie and make your own damn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
