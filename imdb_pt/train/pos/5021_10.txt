I rented this movie and watched 20 times before taking it back to the store. Bill Paxton has hired some top-notch talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton offer good performances. The story is told in an interesting way, with two flashbacks from 20 years ago, and then it appears in the present, alternating from side to side. This style of narrative makes for a good thriller that can not get boring. Bill Paxton, please make more horror movies, you have the talent for it!
