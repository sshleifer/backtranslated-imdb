I can honestly say that I never expected this movie to be good. I do not like family movies. I am far from being a fan of Shahid Kapoor. But there was Amrita Rao, who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There were also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher who are So, a few good points. <br /> <br /> I finally saw the movie and I was very impressed.It brings us the young MPK lovers with a hint of the HAHK wedding, and we have a winner. is similar to HAHK, the heart light at the beginning to serious way in the end. The director also did character that you could relate to. The thing I did not like about HAHK was that the characters were very eccentric.Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good This is a great improvement, and more importantly it fits into the paper.The best one is easily Amrita Rao.In fact, this is your best performance.His presence on the screen is so electrifying, you will love its performance.Sameer Soni Amrutha Praka sh, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are incredibly well-rounded. No actor feels dislocated. <br /> <br /> The songs were pretty disappointing, but they'll sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Anjaane Ajnabi are good ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also good to watch. The songs are not colorful and dancing, and are more like ballads. The exception is Hamadi Shaadi Mein, who is bound to remind him of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the flaw in the movie? The film gets very slow and the end is quite stretched. But the film still continues at a good pace, making it a perfect family movie.
