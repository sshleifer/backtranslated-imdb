The IMDb lists this as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen including the excellent grades of the program mark it as '68. It really does not matter except that it is quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video (one of the first works of art to merge the two apparently) in the context of the Star Gate sequel in 2001, released the same year. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super saturated colors optically printed and the psychedelic feel of this series of flowers, Rohrschach blurs, birds, etc. are very attractive and very beautiful. It certainly helped pave the way for many other nascent video artists in the 1970s, and deserves to be better known.
