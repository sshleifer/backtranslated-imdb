Unlike many other films, which are disturbing, whether for his bare dislike (Man Bites Dog) or for his sheer violence (most of Peckinpah's films), liberation shocks by its plausibility. Of course, the buggy scene is rather straightforward in unpleasant terms, but the effect of the film stems much more from its slow development and the tangible sense of isolation that surrounds the four lanes, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who do not even recognize the men with whom he has touched previously, the more he shows any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister of modern cinema. Tension steadily increases during canoe travel, and perseveres even after the final credits - the end renders the meaning of the trials of the characters horribly real. The plausibility of the film is greatly aided by the game's protagonists, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds has also never been better. The cultural influence of the film is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to "banjo territory" - maybe just Get Carter has done such an effective ax job in the tourist industry of a region. I can think of just a few movies that put me in such a serious depression after they've finished - Se7en's oppressive atmosphere is the best comparison I can imagine. While much of it is excellent by itself, Liberation is a classic above all because there are no proper points of comparison to it - it is unique.
