This is as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the show with her outrageous behavior and clothes, and the film was probably made because the audience wanted to see more of Cruella. We see a lot more this time around. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the rather clumsy male leader. Using Paris as the movie's climax was a clever idea. The movie is worth watching, whatever your age, as long as you enjoy animals.
