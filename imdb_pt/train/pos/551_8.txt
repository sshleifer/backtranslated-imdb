The fourth of the five westerns that Anthony Mann did with James Stewart, this involves a tough cattle rancher named Jeff Webster, who takes a cattle drive from Wyoming to Alaska via Seattle. He connects in Seattle with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) who he sent in advance to make preparations for the boat trip north. <br /> <br /> But first, he has to put up with insubordinate trail hands, fool the captains of the river boats and the charms of the Ronda Castle manipulator (Ruth Roman), who believes that Jeff could be a valuable ally in the future. That's why she hides him on the boat while the captain is looking for him (for the justifiable) murder of a trail hand. <br /> Jeff also has the misfortune to come across the despicable Judge Gannon (John McIntire). ) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon blocks Jeff by interrupting his public hanging, passing his cattle around town. He fine Jeff the ownership of his cattle and Jeff just has to eat crow for now. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Jeff agrees to go from Ronda to Dawson to deliver supplies. But that's just a gimmick, so Jeff, Ben and Rube can go back to Skagway and steal their cattle back. Of course, Judge Gannon finds out about this and he's just behind, but he's late for Jeff with a rifle while Ben runs the cattle over the Canadian border out of Gannon's reach. <br /> <br /> After avoiding an avalanche and another shootout with Some other Skagway men, they finally arrive in Dawson, where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder, Ronda, who then builds a new betting on Dawson. Jeff then takes his money and buys a claim and starts looking for gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon comes up to Dawson to get into the golden action and tells Jeff that he was getting a little bored with Skagway and wants to try his luck on the Klondike, himself. This involves bringing in some hired gunslingers and stealing some of the claims of another miner. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to leave while events are good, leaving Rube to defend himself as a more ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They search for a way out only to find themselves ambushed by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is seriously injured, but that does not save Judge Gannon from his due. Late night shooting on Dawson's muddy street pretty much takes care of it. First Jeff kills two of Gannon's best marksmen (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). So when Ronda leaves to warn Jeff that Gannon is trying to escape behind him, Gannon shoots her back and she dies there in Jeff's arms. So Jeff kills Gannon while he's hiding under a wooden walkway. Vengeance spoke. <br /> <br /> This is another western that is up there with the NAKED SPUR and THE MAN OF LARAMIE. Because Universal DVD uses pan and scan printing instead of the widescreen printing that TCM uses, it is beyond me. You'll end up losing half of Alberta's glorious cinematography by William Daniels. So, if you like well written westerns from the 50s, then this is a guardian of the list. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
