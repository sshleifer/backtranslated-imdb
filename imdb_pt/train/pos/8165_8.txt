The dentist was made at a time when almost all professions were psychopaths. We had crazy cops, ambulance, secretaries, and that was just for starters. The dentist has arrived surprisingly late because going to the dentist is usually every man's nightmare. <br /> <br /> The plot is distorted. The super clean dentist Doctor Feinstone lives the perfect life in his big white house, he has a beautiful blonde wife and a great place to work as a dentist. Black clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of the nasty face of the Terminator's Earl Boen, dirty swimming pool cleaner "cleaning" his wife and suddenly all the teeth seem to have gone through a dark filter. He goes crazy and starts caring for people's teeth in an unpleasant way. And you do not want to come his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna produced such stylish horror films as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel to Re-Animator and his first film Society was a legal spinoff of John Carpenter, They Live. Film producer Pierre David is known in films as Scanners. The cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League, but I could dream younger with him as a psycho dentist. He was really great in his role and he was a kind of sad person. Linda Hoffman was pretty and dumb as Feinstone's wife. Micahel Stadvec did not have many lines, but after I saw him with ladies from the neighborhood, I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) was a nice sight as a cop on the case. Virginya Keehne was the innocent teenager who is about to be Feinstone's next client. <br /> <br /> Final warning: If you are like me and have problems with the dentist, maybe you should skip this one. But if you want to try, you should prepare yourself with black humor and many unpleasant studies.
