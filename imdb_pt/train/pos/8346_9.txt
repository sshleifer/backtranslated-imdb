I just watched Q. again tonight and had forgotten how much I love this movie. It's wonderfully entertaining and lets you feel that everything is right with the world. I love allusions to Mozart throughout the opening with "Einstein" playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" on the violin to him humming Eine Kleine Nachtmusik during the Ed Walters IQ test. I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, a situation especially unique for the 1950's, the time when this film is set. (I myself have been a teacher, but I stayed home to raise my children, so please do not think that I am a libertine of loyal women.) It is wonderful how a man who is "just a monkey" is finally seen as important and worthy as the fianc√© of Catherine, a clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by much more - there are no labels. There are so many pranks and phrases that are almost disposable if you do not watch and listen carefully. <br /> <br /> I picked up some things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. In the scene where Ed Walters will speak at the symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler etc.) hung to the right of the edge of the chalk. In the next film shoot, there are only 2. In the credits in our video, he lists Tony Shaloub's character as Bob Watters, not Bob Rosetti when he introduces himself in the film and is listed here on Imdb. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. It may be a fluff on some estimates, but it has much more substance than many give credit. Not only that, that great cast is set here. Watch and enjoy!
