Like Dr. Alan Feinstone, Corbin Bernsen performs a wonderfully crazy performance on "The Dentist." With its already obsessive compulsive tendencies at high speed, the IRS chasing it, and a very suspicious wife; Dr. Alan Feinstone is losing his sanity every day. <br /> <br /> When the doctor really realizes that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy, this triggers a series of events that lead to torture, murder, total anthill! "The Dentist" is a solid movie! Bernsen makes Dr. Feinstone's character identifiable and can be played at the same time. Even though he is completely out of his gourd, the public will still feel sympathy for him. That my friends ..... is very good acting. <br /> <br /> A good solid cast of supporting actors completes this gem of a movie. Outstanding direction, good killings and blood, and an effective pace will keep you entertained throughout the course of the movie. <br /> <br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
