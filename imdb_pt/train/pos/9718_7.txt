POSSIBLE SPOILER - In a way "How to Alienate Friends ...." is the "loser learns to adjust, becomes successful and discovers that something more matters more" kind of story, situated in the business of celebrities. - END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy offers several good moments. Although I think the ending is flawed. It seemed very fast and very abrupt, as if something was missing. Also, I would say that the movie is not able to maintain a high level. In addition, you'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with controversial acting qualities. So far I've never seen Pegg differently. Still, he's a very original guy, though on the screen he sometimes seems a little more tedious than necessary. Fox has proved that he can interpret a hot star with his head in the clouds. I do not know if it was a hard thing to do, but her performance was pretty good and so much better than during the "Transformers" (okay ... probably not a difficult combination). Kirsten Dunst is very Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may like (or I like) annoying. On the other hand, you'll see Anderson who proved his acting skills and Jeff Bridges (that's fine, but maybe he could have acted a little more powerful). They all fit well enough in your character. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a great comedy with some funniest passages, a sweet cast, but a sudden ending.
