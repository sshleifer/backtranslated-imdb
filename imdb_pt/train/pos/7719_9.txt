If you like Star Wars / Trek, come and see where they got all your ideas and movie devices. It's my top 2 all-time favorite, other-world futuristic and psycho-thriller films. The intensity of the root material ("The Tempest" by Shakespeare) is not overshadowed by whizbang tricks (later, Luke). And just because it was made in 1956, do not assume you can 'see the ropes' holding the flying saucer. This was the first movie you could not. Miracle was made on the "A-movie" scale, economics and tastes at the time were strongly against it. And Wilcox's previous hit was "Lassie Come Home." Until I looked it up, I assumed that 'Fred Wilcox' was a pseudonym of a director who was or later became famous, but at the time did not want to be associated with science fiction, which was strictly a 'B' genre at that time. This was a VERY visionary production, or a very fortuitous "mistake" by Hollywood financiers. <br /> <br /> There are large-scale mattes with almost microscopically inserted live action that Lucas used. extensively. There are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; "computers" as they come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. The "transporter" of Star Trek is there, visually, almost unchanged by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the Trek / Wars technobabble turns it off, the scientific references of the FP are not exaggerated and they are all accurate even today. The "ship" set is comprehensive, shimmeringly realistic, as good as anything you've seen ever since, and more convincing than anything that "Trek" has done, for TV or cinema. We did not spend as much time there as I would have liked. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered how the films came to space so competently, watching FP would explain it all. It's definitely not 'Wagontrain to the Stars'.
