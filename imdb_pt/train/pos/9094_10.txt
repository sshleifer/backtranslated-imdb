I saw this independent movie when I was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story - hilarious! It has some great character actors as well. Mindy Sterling is in it and it's very good. I loved her in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is fantastic, too. I remember him from the Head of the Class. I'm tired of all the dark movies that are still being made. This is fun and light, and I can watch with my family and not get embarrassed. I keep checking to see when it will come out on DVD. I'll definitely buy it.
