Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) spent most of her life taking care of her father. Now that he's dead she's free - but she does not know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who escaped from a monastery to prove more of life. They meet accidentally in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But he can not leave his past behind and she can not live without him ... <br /> <br /> MODE Overcame romance filled with hysterically bad dialogue and situations. Dietrich and Boyer do their best to perform well, but NOBODY can get away with some of their lines! Still, in a way, it's a classic. It's filmed in gorgeous Technicolor (try watching it on DVD), where every stunning picture is breathtaking. Dietrich is always dressed at 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and attacks hysterical poses to show off her clothes and her body. Boyer just walks around looking around (no shock). Still, I was never bored. It was wonderful to look at and the stupid and nonstop dialogue kept me in stitches. The end almost made me fall off the chair because I was laughing so hard! Now I love corny novels and give them plenty of space, but really --- this is unbelievable! It also runs a very short time of 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a camp classic, I give it 8. Like a serious movie - a 1.
