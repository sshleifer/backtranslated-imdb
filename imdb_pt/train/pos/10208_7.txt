Rarely do we see such short reviews by videographers of IMDb. Maybe it's because this mild comedy of dark humor entertains and pleases without depth, or are we missing something? I would see him again if I had any incentive. <br /> <br /> So, what is a coincidence? For the French is Serendipity "Ser Battement d'Ailes du Papillon"? Destiny? Perhaps it is an event that is the culmination of a series of random events. We all have had this (called life), but when viewed that way, you start to get the feeling that "random" might be more like "doomed." A "chance" in This movie can be as small an occurrence as knocking down some lettuce leaves on the back of a truck or as important as basing a big life decision on the accuracy of a stranger firing a Boulder. All these incidents cause other events that ... well, you get the picture? Dominoes. Multiply them by 30 characters and an average of 6 each, and you'll have to stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario might happen. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like that. But then this is the magical world of cinema. <br /> <br /> We admit it's fun to watch how the writer / director interweaves these unrelated events into a story that involves the lives of these French citizens. If you have a couple of hours and are looking for an extravagant escape, here is the place to do it. Or if you are recovering from surgery and are not going anywhere anyway, this will involve you while your stitches are healing. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" will not be a prize winner, but it should develop a cult of followers. Stranger things happened. <br /> <br /> Soren Kierkegaard is attributed with the following: "Life can only be understood backwards but must be lived on." If you observed the details in many of your life experiences (finding your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last car accident), you would find a series of seemingly random events that would take you to it. <br /> <br /> That's the answer! I forgot to bring in an existentialist to explain "Happenstance" to me.
