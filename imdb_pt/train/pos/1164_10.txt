I saw this movie when it first came out. It was an official selection at the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for it as Best Picture. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is hot as the psychotic, but complex Amanda. This is not your normal psychotic movie. Lots of interesting and original slopes in the genre. A sort of "Fatal Attraction" for the younger group, with a large blues music mixed as an object of Amanda's affection, is married to a blues singer who has less time for her husband while his career takes off. <br /> <br />
