I'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just superficial, high performance and visual. Whatever the case, I'm sure I loved it. From the wonderfully distorted, lugubrious and intertwined stories to the delightfully sinister performances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, to the vivid and flashy color with which everything is captured, this is high class trash and it's a lot of fun. Not to mention the playfully concealed and veiled sexual subtexts that permeate the entire film, always threatening to escape from the image for dialogue but never doing so. I would be lying if I said that the pure entertainment value of the movie did not contribute to my love for him, but there is some kind of bizarre art behind unintentional comedy (or was it?) And I really, really dig it. I could actually get into this melodrama material.
