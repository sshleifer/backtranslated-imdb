I was a young film student in 1979, when the Union of Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia, Bulgaria, and premiered "Siberiade" by Konchalovsky; "Stalker" by Tarkosvky and Danelia'a "Autumn Marathon". I was impressed by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then, I saw "Siberiade" 4 and 1/2 hour epic and was speechless. Much better than Bertolucci's "1900". By far! <br /> <br /> Hope Andron will somehow get to the negative and make "restored full length director's length" someday! On DVD of course! I also fiercely fought in defense of this Cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating the Soviet film with bad taste! Time is in my favor.
