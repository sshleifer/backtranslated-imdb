When I first saw the title, I was already deducing the theme from the film - clearly it was not a reference to the British currency, so it had to be Shakespearean and about pounds of meat - catch them, or give them. Will Smith is a sensible actor, so serial killers were out. It just might be about a man giving them, so it should be about guilt in some way. I blew it all away for myself by looking and getting to know the story before I watched it, since the beauty of development is how parts of the main character's background are fed to slowly illuminate the audience about who it is and why it is doing what you're doing. <br /> <br /> Guilt is a very difficult subject to do simply because it is deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are waiting for a roller coaster. you know it's going to be nasty. I would not say that the movie glorifies suicide; it plunges into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom. <br /> <br /> It is also filled with symbolism everywhere, which is a clear sign that writing was cleverly thought of in detail and multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature. The most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not just giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically but was physically giving her as the greatest gift he could. Determined to die, but his plan is frustrated by falling in love - which is a complication second act. Absolutely magisterial. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is very slow, but I am undecided about whether it would have been better fitted in a shorter period. I did not feel the tension and its terrible inner turmoil as much as I could have, but perhaps it is only me to have ruined this by myself beforehand. All in all, it's a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably receive.
