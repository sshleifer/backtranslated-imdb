Yes, this is a horror anthology movie and it was a lot of fun! That's because while the film was clearly horror, some of the stories were light-hearted - and sometimes there was some laughter. This is not all bad, since sometimes the horror films are a bit muffled and serious too. Because of this and because all four stories were very good, it's one of the best movies of that kind I've seen. <br /> <br /> The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories involve people who rent the house or investigate what happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> The first segment starred Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who owns a writer block. So, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately the lock on Elliott disappears and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer. Surprisingly, shortly after the disappearance of his block, he begins to see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears - making it seem like he's losing his mind. This may just be the best of stories, as the good ending of the story makes the story come alive. <br /> <br /> The second, although not bad, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who longs for a girlfriend who died some time ago (though her photo seemed incredibly contemporary). When he walks into a chamber of horrors from the wax museum in the city, he sees a wax figure reminiscent of his lost wife and he is fascinated and scared by it. Later a friend (Joss Ackland) visits and he also sees the figure and becomes fascinated by it. This all leads to an end that, frankly, was a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee, then, stars as an incredibly harsh and harsh father to a pathetic little girl. For most of this segment, Lee looked like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his behavior. Although slow, this ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the most foolish and was designed to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" of the television series DR WHO) is a very temperamental actor known for his interpretations of Dracula. However, nothing is certain about the film according to him and in a stinging attack, he steps off the set to find better props for this vampire movie. It's really interesting that he played the role, since it seemed natural to Christopher Lee, who played Dracula or other vampires, a zillion times (more or less a few). I liked Pertwee's speech when he basically said Lee's incarnations and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all crap compared to Bela Lugosi's! Maybe that's why Lee did not take that part! Despite some really silly moments, it was a lot of fun and fun - possibly as good or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Considering that the film started and finished so well, had excellent acting and writing, it's hard not to like this movie.
