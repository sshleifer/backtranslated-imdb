At the moment I am writing this, I see that of more than 15,000 votes has a rating of 5.8. Something is wrong with this photo. Personally I give a 10. I can see a 7 in the smallest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people who see this movie for what it really is. It's a movie based on a comic book hero. This movie has earned more than its share of awards. It gained 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations ... there they tell me it's better than a 5.8. Some great performances by some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be if it is no longer a classic in the next few years. If you are looking for pure entertainment, be sure to check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that you can watch more than a few times. Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice.
