Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) is dismembered, missing her lover; she is not able to overcome her love for him that has been lost in the past. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and gives a list of his mistakes to him with things to mend. But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first point that impresses in "The Cure" is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color. The concise and sharp script is capable of developing a tragic and somber tale of love with an unexpected plot at the end in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a bit high and associated with the fact that English is not my native language, at times I had to repeat some words whispered by the narrator. The unknown main actress performs magnificent and is extremely beautiful. I hope I get a chance to see her on the screen again. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
