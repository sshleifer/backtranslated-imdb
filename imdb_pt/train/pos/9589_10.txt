Growing up in New York in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries made to cover this place in this time period. No Madonna did not come up with the idea of ​​Voguing, but this is where she got it! Instead of fighting violence against each other or in cat fights, voguing allowed people to "fight" within the confines of everything except touching each other (which would justify automatic disqualification). Seeing this kind of extraordinarily talented / well orchestrated "knocked over" clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names back in the day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc ... all celebrated in the likes of pieces like Malcom McLaren's song "Deep in Vogue" ... it did not matter who you were, or where you were, because when you walked through those doors in that "magic realm" of In a way, you became part of something bigger than you / you were important / and more importantly, creating your own movements and imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could become King (or Queen) as it could have been. The words and intelligence were as sharp as the movements on the floor. All the tension, excitement, and magic of this urban New York energy is captured in this film. BRIGHT!!! PLEASE, FREE on DVD for the world to see !!! Thank you!
