Despite having one of the "Revenge Price Plots", this movie is my favorite of Vincent Price's work. Gallico has this quality that is lacking in so many horror movie characters - sympathy. When you watch, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you cheer him up when he revenges himself, even though he is a little afraid of his original fury. As the film continues, his character becomes tragic. He committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover it. And again to cover this. And again ... your stomach sinks with your soul as it spirals down - like seeing a beloved brother turn a hood. Even though the story of revenge is ancient, the plot's own devices are unique - Gallico uses his tricks to kill in ever more inventive ways. A shame this is not available for veiwing at home.
