Fact: The Stargate SG-1 is a science fiction TV series. <br /> <br /> There are no escaping facts. As you try to apologize or explain, the Stargate SG-1 remains a science-fiction TV series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 makes loans and steals ideas quickly. FX specials are not as impressive as they could have been and the action will not get you out of the chair. Or couch for that subject too. <br /> <br /> But, and this is where I really think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get, for every episode or idea stolen, I think you can count at least one movie of which is actually worse than a one-hour TV episode. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes could have lasted 90 minutes and still be better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And being able to maintain that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the plot even more is what makes the SG-1 Stargate special. <br /> <br /> I'm very picky with my selections. I follow, perhaps, one or two TV series at most and I have very high standards, which made me even more surprised when I found myself in jail. <br /> <br /> So for those who decide to brush Stargate SG-1 yet another tacky science fiction show, no. Stick with it and you'll see what I'm talking about.
