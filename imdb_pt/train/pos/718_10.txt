Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so incredible was because of the Ramones! You could not have made the same movie and put something like Sex Pistols, or The Clash in place of The Ramones, it just would not have been the same. Dey Young, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and the Salon Montros, just added to the film. The whole movie is about the Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed off Rock 'n' Roll High School if you're a big fan of the real PUNK. Not a new crap ... but the tall, fast guy. The kind the Ramones could only do. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
