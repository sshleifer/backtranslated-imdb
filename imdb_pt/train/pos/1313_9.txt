More TV movies should be made like this. I saw the way back in '93 when it was the first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were great, giving very brave and realistic performances. Weber was especially good at transforming into an exceptionally scary and unobtrusive performance as the child molester / killer. This movie really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which was somehow both stereotyped and exciting. But the direction in both works has the same simple and glaring realism that is so appealing. If you like TV movies that are not predictable and full of overacting, see if you can. The parallel story about the case of Hunt and Fahey is also appealing without diminishing the main story.
