That was excellent. Touching, action packed and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 stars. This film is the story of an obsolete soldier who discovers that there is more to life than soldiers, and people who learn that there is a time to fight, a need to defend. I cried, laughed and mostly marveled at this story. Good writing work for an action movie, and the plot was appropriately and reasonably solid. The end was not winding, but still excellent. If you like to get away from New York or cheer for the underdog, this movie is for you. It is not an undue amount of violence or violence, it was not difficult to watch in that regard. Something for everyone.
