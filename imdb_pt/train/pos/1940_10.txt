I was really impressed with this movie. The writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple. It is very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them. The creators of this movie really hit the jackpot when it comes to creating real-life characters, and making the viewer suck directly into their world. Also, the music is great. They hired some independents to do the score, and some of the soundtrack, and they did a fantastic job adding to the movie. If you get the chance to watch this movie at a small theater or at a film festival (like I did), I recommend you watch it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is gorgeous in this movie. That's reason enough to take a look.
