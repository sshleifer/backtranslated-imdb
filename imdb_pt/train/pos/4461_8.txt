I really liked this movie. I've seen several of Gene Kelly's films and this is one of their best. I would really put it above your most famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems like the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies for the wonderful numbers of dance and music but not in this movie. It is definitely worth renting.
