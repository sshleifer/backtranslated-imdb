Okay, so Robbie is a little corny by today's standards, and a little bit of the acting is pretty buzzing, and most of the special effects can now be duplicated by a brilliant 12-year-old with a decent computer editing program. And do not tell me about the poster. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching "science fiction" in the "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" of the local TV station on Sunday afternoons, so I saw several science fiction films from the 1950s. At a time when most movies were content to put a rubber clothing on someone and make him demolish a city miniature, Forbidden Planet has forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie that had a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many long-fiction films made in the 1990s are still considered worthy of being seen in 2030.
