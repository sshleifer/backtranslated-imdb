"Written on the Wind" is a melodrama by Douglas Sirk. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc., who hailed him as a director - I think it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography - "Written on the Wind" offers colorful images and beautiful decorations. . But I wonder: is this enough to take a movie? The performance on "Written on the Wind" ranges from weak to fair (except Robert Stack - he is convincing as the weak and pampered playboy). Lauren Bacall, usually a powerful onscreen presence, is misunderstood in this film. Dorothy Malone as the seductress, worry-free "femme fatale" is good, but she has no strength for the role. Rock Hudson is efficient but insipid. <br /> <br /> The plot has very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> A rigid patriarch <br /> <br /> his alcoholic son Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by the disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his frustrated and Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a principled woman, former secretary and now married to Kyle <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought along with Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets beyond the door, a love triangle, frustration, fights, laughter, death, etc. - Well, when I read the story summary on the back cover of the DVD I thought I was in for a treat. My mistake! Because? I'll try to explain: "Written on the Wind" is taken seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before, acting in general is not good enough - the intensity is lacking. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors do an efficient job. I think maybe with Italian or Spanish actors these scenes would have been explored completely - they would end up (for us) in a burst of laughter or tears. <br /> <br /> What we have left is Douglas's beautiful cinematography. Sirk To me this is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Adventurer".
