<br /> <br /> I saw The Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old - I screamed for my parents to take me back three times. I started looking for it on video about five years ago, finally finding a copy on an online auction site, but I would love to see it being acquired by a new distributor and relaunched (I understand the original video was small), or have the rights purchased by The Family Channel, Disney, etc. and displayed regularly. It is a fascinating film that takes you to the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern Japan, told by an ancient and wise tree. The excellent soundtrack complements the film well. Would be a good seller today, better than many of the weak offers of children's movies today.
