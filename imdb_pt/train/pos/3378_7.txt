This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well, actually, I watched the two Simpsons and Futurama and it's mentioned in both, so I thought "what the heck." The film brings home some "what ifs" that make you realize how lucky we are nowadays, where we take simple things like soap and water as guaranteed. Interesting that in the year 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade razor! It's cool that those responsible did not overload the movie with unnecessary special effects, lightning weapons, etc. Some nice furniture when you find out what that means. Remember, "Tuesday is Soylent Green Day"
