Made in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai was one of the great films made by Welles after returning from relative exile to become Citizen Kane. Dark, taciturn and expressing some Cold War paranoia, this movie is high as a Film-Noir thriller. The cinematography of this film is filled with peculiar features of Welles from strange angles, quick cuts, long pans and sinister lighting. The use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening in Touch of Evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and sequences in Chinatown can only be regarded as the inspiration in many ways for Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, it's Welles's obsession with the technical filmmaking that wounds the whole movie. The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques. <br /> <br /> However, despite this criticism, the story combined with wonderful performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) movie a joy to watch. Orson Welles takes away not only the Irish accent, but the identities torn as the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time, breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions. Finally, the strange and bizarre portrait of Glenn Anders or the law partner of Elsa's husbands is nothing short of classic!
