There's nothing you really dislike about "The Odd Couple," and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make an extremely successful comedy team. But there is something so underdeveloped in Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit play that makes it look more like a sketch comedy than a full-length movie. I did not see the piece, but I have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful, since Simon wrote it, so the defects can not be attributed to a stage-to-screen adaptation. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two newly divorced men who immediately fall into traditional married roles when they become roommates, because neither of them knows differently - that Simon never fully understands. Still, there are many worse ways to kill a few hours.
