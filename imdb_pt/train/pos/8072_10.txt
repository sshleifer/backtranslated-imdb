Magnificent and unforgettable, incredibly atmospheric, and brilliantly represented by all. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand what kind of people are doing this masterpiece and giving preponderance of votes like 8 (and nine!) <BR> This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's biggest film. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line, though far away. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. He deserves a 12.
