The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg. He shows us the Tsarist general, Grand Duke SÃ©rgio Alexandre (Emil Jannings) in his glory days. In 1917 he had all power, but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he has nothing. He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent). About ten years later, he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution. His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who comes to choose whether to hire him as an extra film or not. The Last Command is very good silent drama.Emil Jannings makes memorable paper work in the lead.Evelyn Brent is wonderful to play the woman leader.William Powell is great as always.There are many scenes to remember in this movie.Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent.And then there is the ending with Powell and Jannings.This is a movie that touches on many parts.
