The word 'classic' is played very loosely nowadays, but this movie deserves the title. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the best comic actor in the world), and the late George Burns, create a comic masterpiece. It is interesting to imagine how the film would have been had not death prevented Jack Benny from playing George Burns, as planned. As it is, the meeting scene in Matthau's apartment probably will not be overcome as a sideplitter. Definitely one of my deserted island movies. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
