Allen and Julie move to a mountain cabin after their daughter is murdered one night. No one knows who killed the girl, but that's why they moved to the mountains. So the couple moves into this hut and is haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very afraid and has a lot of parts that made me jump. Some of the parts are predictable, but every now and then there is a part that I did not expect. It was a very good movie that was not the scariest movie in the world, but it was still scary enough to make it very good. <br /> <br /> I also liked the ending because it let the viewer decide how it ends. It's also a sad movie, but a well-made horror film.
