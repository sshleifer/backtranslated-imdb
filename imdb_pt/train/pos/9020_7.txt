The Theory Of Flight is an engaging character study of an artist (Branagh) who wants to break free from boredom and mediocrity, and a terminally ill patient (Bonham-Carter) in the latter stages of ASL, confined to a wheelchair, who wishes make love to a man before he dies. Helena Bonham-Carter exudes humor, challenge and independence as an ASL patient who is virtually dependent on the people around her to care for her. Kenneth Branagh, sentenced through community service to take care of her, complements Helen's charm with melancholy sadness, creating a compelling and sentimental love story in which two people try to help each other find the way to happiness, before the time runs out.
