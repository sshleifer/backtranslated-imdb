The Blob is a classic B-movie science fiction movie from the 1950's. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite hit the ground, and when they go to look for it, they find an old with a strange bubble ... trapped in his arm. They take him to the doctor's office and then find out what happened. From there, the bubble spreads, eating everyone in its path. Special effects are funny, just like the story. There are many good touches, like the cop who plays chess on the radio with a policeman in another district. It is not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10
