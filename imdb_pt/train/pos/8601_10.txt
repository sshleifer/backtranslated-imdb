My remarks: the vampire outfit at the end is sweeping and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette wore it well and stayed with the naive Nelson. Boat crashing on your porch served him right. Costumes of your female mafia have been designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. The 1942 costume designer did an excellent job. Main song theme, simply adorable. <br /> <br /> Beware of negative posters: 1942 was the time of World War II; Pearl Harbor happened year before. US coming out of the Great Depression; I had to go out and spend that hard-earned money on singing, dancing, and fun fantasy. Despot dictators tried to discard RL, extinguishing freedoms. Thank God the audience had these great scripts to watch. Cinema was a privileged pleasure in those depressing times. When you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have room to talk and critique. Jeanette and Nelson's films stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Wonderful angel wings, on the real angel. RL flies at the party not so hot, but it's great at Jeanette considering SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful singing of Jeanette and Nelson, as always. The Jeanette dance was a pure delight. <br /> <br /> 15/10
