This and "Hidden Fortress" are the Kurosawa that are more expensive to me. I do not distribute 10s as candy, but it certainly deserved it, if anything. Even though it is quite long (as all Kurosawa are), he agreed with the problem that bothers me with most of his films; the plot is often very loose and slowly evolving, containing scenes that are unnecessary or just gone too long without any real purpose for the plot or character description. Dodesukaden gave me the same experience that, for example, "hidden fortress" did; despite his time, there was not a single minute I cut. <br /> <br /> This is also a very unusual Kurosawa film in a way, has no plot, but many small independent stories that are based more on the description of the character than on the plot, unlike any other movie Kurosawa I've seen so far. He also draws heavily on dialogue, which he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between father and son planning their "new home"). <br /> <br /> Still, the thing that makes this a work of art is how the subject is as tragic as it is, it is managed to be described so humanly and sympathetically, without pointing fingers at anyone at any time . From beginning to end, it offers the entire emotional scale, from laughter to tears, in perfect balance.
