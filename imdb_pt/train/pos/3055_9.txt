In his first time as a Hollywood director, Henry Brommell launches a captivating thread, full of penetrating marriage issues, with melancholy authenticity, and entwined with an equally absorbing subplot of a father-son business. The film is shrewdly directed and consists of a wonderfully put together cast, as well as a fast, familiar script (also by Brommell) that brings life to a weary genre. As a bonus, 'Panic' offers a subtle and bitter humor - an unexpected, undeniably charming and much-welcomed surprise - through its discreet, insecure and insecure star, whose always fresh state is attractive, especially given its line of work . <br /> <br /> The ever-great William H. Macy once again captures our hearts as Alex, an unhappy, lacerated middle-aged father and father who finds solace in the most dubious: a young, 23-year-old , attractive and equally misfit Sarah (Neve Campbell), whom he finds in the waiting room of a psychologist's office, where he awaits the therapy of Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) to discuss his growing eagerness to drop the family business that his father (Donald Sutherland) built. Alex, whose desire to lead a new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his father dictator, causes a reckless fantasy by Sarah, that finally leads him to understand the essence and the irrefutable responsibility of being a husband for his wife and, more importantly he , a good father to his six-year-old son, Sammy (played enthusiastically by the captivating David Dorfman). Henry Brommell's brilliant 'Panic' is a rarely seen Hollywood rarity (with the exception of the 'Road to Perdition' 2002) since its conception in 2000 - it weaves two conflicting genres (organized crime , family drama) in a fascinating, hot piece of movie vision that is equally strong in any direction - and is one that will maintain its exceptional and infrequent caliber and glowing sincerity for the next generations.
