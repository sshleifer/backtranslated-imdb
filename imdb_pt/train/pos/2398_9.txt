I really liked this movie. It took a rather somber story - that of Shakespeare's Macbeth - and wrapped it in a peculiar, often amusing and pungent modern thread. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern NYC and Macbeth Scotland together under one roof. The opposing worlds act to really bring the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love Harold Perrineau as the Chorus, a part that does not exist in the play, but really helps jazz things up. The finalization stands out among the small indies that I saw by closure and originality.
