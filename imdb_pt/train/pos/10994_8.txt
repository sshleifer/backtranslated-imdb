This is my first comment! This is a fantastic movie! I watched it all by luck one night on TV. In the first 5 minutes I thought it was a B movie, but then I understood what an incredible product that was. <br /> <br /> I suggested to some friends to see the movie, just to tell me it was bad Movie B How wrong. Superficial criticisms. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is almost a product of genius! The well-known director did a great job here and it's a shame to say he was out of the game all this time.
