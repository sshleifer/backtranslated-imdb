Sports movies have never been my thing, but a small group of them work for me. The best are those who focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great debut in the direction of Karyn Kusama, and a great first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels both realistic and engaging enough to make it a memorable movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a step ahead enough. Diana Guzman, is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her fights in the hallway, she is about to be expelled. As a possible means of releasing her anger, she enrolls for boxing classes at the club where her brother is training (with his father's wishes). <br /> <br /> Over ninety minutes, we viewers see something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it in his body as well as his behavior, especially when one of the club's boys finds himself attracted to her, and she enters into it. There is not a bad scene or a lame / invented moment in the movie. The only mistake I would say that could be fixed is that one of the subframes ends in what appears to be an unfinished note. In addition, Girlfight is a great movie.
