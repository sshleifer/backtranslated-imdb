I gave this movie a high note because it was very cute, very funny, despite being unpretentious. I went to see this movie while playing in the Philadelphia area, and it was the centerpiece of a great night with friends. The film is well-written and well-represented, and although it looks a bit like a sitcom rather than a movie, it does not take the film. You do not find comedies like this one where you do not have to shock people to be funny. The film revolves around a Ukrainian housekeeper who is working for a young couple who needs help. Although at first it helps, it soon adds more craziness to their lives than the couple expected. Things get more and more out of control until ... you'll have to see! The joke made me laugh, even after I left the theater. This movie just made me feel good. I can not wait until it's released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
