Any movie that shows that the federal PIGs are the powerful threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the supervision and editing of the script and even sometimes the direction is flawed, so there will be people who will depreciate the whole movie and ignore the good times. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way back when I was young and hated, despised, hated it. I thought it was terrible and irrational garbage. <br /> <br /> Now, however, I can not remember why. <br /> <br /> I believe the two should not be compared or even connected. <br /> <br /> Consider them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> Rate them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> This "Vanishing Point" is a meeting place, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat to freedom that government can be and is, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> "The Voice" uses a New Hampshire state motto: "Live Free or Die". At the same time, it would have been the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is an animated film.
