This is a great surprise. Small, cute story of the heroine quest, a very surprising metamorphosis of the spinster type who would soon become a four-eyed spinster in a daring queen of sex. <br /> <br /> Visually, a sight for sore eyes, not just for two stunning actresses, but also for (most) the costumes and make-up of the actors. A little unnecessary cheap came in some ridiculous imitation of the castle. <br /> <br /> Back to the positives: The movie is tempered with some unusually explicit camera shots you would not expect in a soft core. I loved that scene with the icicles, absolute potential of the classics. A slight less just for (very) few strange scenes in which the poor performance by minor castings suspended in a short time the suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> 9/10 including an extra credit for the serious effect of drooling.
