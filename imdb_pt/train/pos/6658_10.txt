Mahatma was described as a man who neglected his own son in this film. Do not get me wrong, I'm not condemning the movie; is a wonderful film and left the cinema with a lump in the throat. We need to understand the spiritual position of Mahatma, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man could detach himself from his loved ones. A man of such caliber leads his family and followers by example. According to the film, he spoke to his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harilall, with so little intellect, could not understand his father. When things went awry with Harilall, Mahatma was able to remain calm and accepted that his son is a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If they were other parents, they would have compromised their values ​​to help the son get up. Mahatma did not do this, he is the true leader who leads by example.
