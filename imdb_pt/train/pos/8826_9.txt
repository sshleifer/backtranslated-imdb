If you have fun with things that seem logical and logical within a given illogical situation, you'll love this 8-minute Spanish movie. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene sounds ordinary, but the clerk, clients and two musicians seem strangely subdued. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play and a man begins to sing the title song, dancing on tables with musical comedy. gestures. The clients, at first immobile, intercalated (badly but clumsily) the phrases of the music, they read themselves on pieces of paper in the palms of the hands. From time to time they jump and dance (awkwardly but honestly) in choreographed movements, as supporting singers. <br /> <br /> But why ??? the woman asks herself. The answer is revealed when the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's stuck in her chest - just before the explosive climax ... <br /> <br /> Even if you do not pick up the (probably ironic) lyrics from music, the perfect performances should give a smile and a laugh ... I would love to see it again!
