This movie is horrible - in a 'so bad it's good'. <br /> <br /> The plot is reminiscent of so many other such films that I will not even bother describing it. It's a sword / witchcraft image, there's a kid waiting to realize just how important he is in this world, there's a nomadic adventurer, an evil helper / sorcerer, a princess, a hairy creature ... you get it. The first time I got this movie was during a very rigorous winter. I do not know why I decided to keep watching for another five minutes before turning on the channel, but when I picked up the Gulfax website, I decided to stay and watch until the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white, hairy creature similar to Chewbacca, but not as useful or fun to watch. It seems that someone pasted a lot of white carpets and forced the actor to use it. There are scenes in which it seems that the actor can not move in, or that he is almost falling. Although he is not much in the movie, the few scenes are worth it! See how he tries to talk to Bo Svenson, taking Solo-Chewbacca's comparison to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I actually bought this movie just because of this character, and I still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I never saw the sequence, or even looked for it, was because of his absence! Maybe there should be a final film, completing the trilogy, Gulfax will make a comeback much awaited!
