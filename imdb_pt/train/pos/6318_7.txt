I had tried to rent this on many occasions but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, generally rejects assault films and group comedies with the commentary "Uhm ... sounds good, but I'm not in the mood for this movie. "This is how" Mighty Night of Cinema Solo "comes in! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a very nice film. Although, in the end, it is quite forgettable, he has moments of fun and some moments of laughter. I was not familiar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a rule watching movies trying to ignore this fact and seeing them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney makes a small, humorous, safe cookie that, most of the time, left me thinking two things ... 1. Would not all the comedies be better if Mr. Clooney put on a strange 5-minute appearance? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash? The cast, all excellent actors, did a great job, and you get the impression that they had a lot of fun working together, which is quite important in a movie like this. Needless to say, not everything is as planned in this film, both in terms of plot and mood, but made me check the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time, maybe take some friends and get a pizza. you'll have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the much-appreciated Paolo Conte used, and that left me humming bits of the score long after the credits rolled.
