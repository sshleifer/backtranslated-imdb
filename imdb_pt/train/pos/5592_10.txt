Famous for presenting the world to Hedy Lamarr and full frontal nudity, but it is much more. In fact, this is one of the pinnacles of film poetry, with some of the seminal works of art cinema of the 1930s, in the same prestigious group of Under the Roof of Paris, Tabu, Olympia and even L'Atalante. It is almost a silence, relying mostly on his miraculous images, and also on the fantastic symphonic soundtrack of Giuseppe Becce. It is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, and also editing, directing, writing and acting. A good 90% of the film moves perfectly. Machat√Ω seems to be an expert at using motifs. Perhaps not as subtle as it might be, and perhaps a bit exaggerated, but the appearances of objects like insects, lights and horses carry the story on beautifully. The small fragments of dialogue are, fortunately, not intrusive. They do not bend as much as you might imagine. The final bit is strange, to say the least. Recalling the Russian silences, we have an assembly of workers. This makes almost no sense in the course of the narrative, but it is so wonderfully done that I refuse to dwell too hard on this flaw. Ecstasy is a movie that desperately needs rediscovery. It belongs among the best movies ever made.
