It's a great movie. I've sowed that some people think this may not be based on a true story. No matter it !!, the movie is great, and all you can think about is not why a balloon with a mermaid ends up flying in the city of mermaids and so on, thinking that "a girl's wish came true" , and that means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in ourselves and do everything in this world to make them true. The little girl (Desi - in the movie) and her mother were the best actors I've seen in a long time. Good for them, for all the actors, all for the director. If anyone can say that, please tell them: "A 25-year-old from Romania thanks you for making this movie."
