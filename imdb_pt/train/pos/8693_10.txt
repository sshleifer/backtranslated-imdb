I was very young when this happened in the US, but I recorded it on TV and watched it several times until I had the whole thing memorized. To this day I still catch myself quoting this. The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra to Sylvester Stallone to Mr. T. The voices were great, and sounded just like the characters they were portraying. The dolls were also well made, albeit a bit scary. I was surprised to discover recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a program that I also really like. As someone else wrote in a previous review, I was also stolen from this great show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned it. I certainly wish there was enough demand for this show to guarantee a DVD release, but I do not think enough people have heard of it. Oh well, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
