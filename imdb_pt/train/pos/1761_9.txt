Only once in a while do we receive a censoring comedy that gets everyone's time and attention. It's an even rarer case when critics will like it. I just got back from the 40 year old Virgin and I can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life. I went to a 10:35 viewing and every line was full. Not only that, everyone laughed all the time. It's two hours of non-stop laughter. I dare you to watch this movie and not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. A man is forty years old and a virgin. However, behind this simple, five-second joke, we are given a deep and complex story that is not only one of the funniest you have ever witnessed, but it has genuine lessons behind it. Steve Carell stars as Andy Stitzer, the 40-year-old virgin. We met Steve Carell, in my opinion, one of the best scene thieves of all time. Stealing hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially Anchorman, Steve Carell has come a long way, as finally, and proudly, is given his moment to shine as the star. No one will forget his name when witnessing this fun and funny hilarious comedy. The beauty of the movie is not 100% stupid. The brilliant writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell is genuinely purposeful and not just a hell of a story to tell. Behind the crudity and the usual non-stop ride of the movie is an important lesson to be learned. Although not presented in the best possible way, the film gives us more than a purely enjoyable moment. Your sweeping attitude will make you laugh all the time, while simultaneously seeing the real-life struggles of people like Andy and his co-workers. The end could not have been better. Not only does it deliver what we're promised, but it gives one of the most memorable final numbers a comedy has ever seen. It would have been perfect if there had been Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson there somehow, but you can not beat them all, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think, as Roger Ebert said, Catherine Keener gives an unaccountable perfect performance as Trish, the only woman that Andy truly has her heart to. Not only does she give us laughter, but it's crazy to see how brilliantly she feeds the story. She was perfected in the role and she and Carell had an extraordinary chemistry hilarious on the screen. <br /> <br /> The Canadian ranking, once again in Ontario, drops with a 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba slapped the 40 year old Virgin with an 18A. The same thing happened to Four Brothers, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario more and more for that. To all of you, fellow teenagers out there in the United States: Good luck coming in! <br /> <br /> Overall, Steve Carell does one of the funniest performances I've ever seen and almost everyone in the cast distributes to laughter non-stop. Everyone is going to love the 40 year old Virgin this summer and I encourage everyone to see it as fast as humanly possible. It's the best comedy of the year, by far. He beats around the longest yard, The Wedding Quasters and of course the last memorable comedy of Apatow and Carell, Anchor. <br /> <br /> It is a comic masterpiece and deserves the remarkable amount of praise from the critics who have been loving it. Each of my favorite critics loved and deserves a place in the Top 250 IMDb immediately. Steve Carell is a great star. Watch one of the brightest of summer now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively ?? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively ?? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
