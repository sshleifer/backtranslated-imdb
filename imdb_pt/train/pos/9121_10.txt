SPOILERS CONTAINED TO MAKE A NOTICE. <br /> <br /> Twenty years from 1984, this movie talks a lot about Prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that sums up Prince's musical production of the last 10 years perfectly, which is if you took out the two best songs from your last 10 albums, you would have a fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene is played like this. Prince rushes into his dressing room after playing a song and the club owner walks into the dressing room to scold Prince about his fall during the '90s and to release albums that only hardcore fans would be able to tolerate. support your art. <br /> <br /> Club owner - "You're not packing like you used to. The only person who likes your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Spooky, huh! How about the musical underline that makes Prince even worse when he hits Apollonia on the floor in two separate scenes! It gave me shivers that this was not the only scene where women were mistreated in this movie. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of the comedies between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, for these two have stolen all the scenes in which they were. But what was funny about throwing a woman into a garbage can? That was just unpleasant! The other nasty part was the chalk outline of Prince's father on the floor thoughtfully provided by the Minneapolis police, which makes Prince even madder !! FANTASTIC !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is a fun movie in general, since it is the soundtrack of Prince's songs that increases its value by 110%. But again, the film gives us another theory about Prince and his music, as the film tells us that the biggest song in Prince's movie is written by Wendy, Lisa and Princes wife beating musical father! <br /> <br /> Are Prince and filmmakers trying to tell us that Prince stole all of his best songs from his father after finding the scores of his father's written songs? Maybe that's why the Prince started running out of energy during the 90's because he ran out of ideas from his father ??? Hmmm .....
