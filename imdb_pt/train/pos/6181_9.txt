A very nice film, as long as you know how to watch old musicals / mysteries. You may not get close to Agatha Christie or even the mysteries of Thin Man as a noir movie, but it's a lot more interesting than the typical backstage musical of "boy meets girl" or "let's do a show." As musical, it's not a Busby Berkley or Freed unit, but it can boost the classic "Coctails for Two" and the odd "Sweet Marijuana". The film is shown in real-time during a show on the opening night of the "Vanities" where one murder - and then another - is discovered behind the scenes. Is the murderer discovered before the curtain falls? Of course, but the quest is fun, even if it's a little predictable and marked by explosions of comic relief (luckily, in the form of the beautiful goddess of the choir girls, Toby Wing). The idiot cop is a bit of an idiot, the main hero is a little too sympathetic, the protagonist is a little too graceful, the bizarre cousin is very rude and the abandoned lover is a bit too selfless, but as stereotypes go , they are very stylish. There are a bunch of really beautiful chorus girls who are picked even better than the girls for a Busby Berkley musical from the same period, which sometimes tend to be a little plump. Yes, this movie could have been a lot better than it is, and Duke Ellington's number is an embarrassment, but if you like to dive into old movies, this will prove to be a tremendously tempting trip.
