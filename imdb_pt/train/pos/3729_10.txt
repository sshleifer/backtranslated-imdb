Although I suppose this movie could make rap as being anti-Vietnam while watching it I did not feel it was as much as the movie was simply an honest look at the perspective of young people being trained for a war. which the public did not support ... showed his fear, his despair, his impulse ... all this in the open, naked. As a soldier, many of the themes seemed true to me in my experience in the military - especially in the training camp. Overall, this movie, although it was run on a very small budget, looks great, is very well assembled and features excellent acting and direction. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for another great Colin Farrell movie. 10/10
