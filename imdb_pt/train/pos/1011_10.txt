I love Jack's jokes like "The cliché is ..." or "Over the cliché, black, oily skin, half scary ...". It is simply hilarious! Daniel is starting to catch up! Thankfully Jack is no longer on the team (in a way), or it would have been a mania of sarcasm !!!! I love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I'm starting to get facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c .. It's all theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! Yours I'm going again !!! Sorry, I'm also starting to pick up traits from Carter, and this is all driving my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, to conclude, I think it's good for three more seasons, especially if they keep packing the episodes with all that humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
