Life Begins is a wonderful pre-coded film starring some of the best of the era. It is placed in the maternity ward of a hospital, particularly in the room where women must have problems. In it is an older woman, a single mother (Glenda Farrell), a frail young woman, an Italian woman and the main character (Loretta Young), who is spending 20 years in jail for homicide. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second painful to know that everything will be well. Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is great at her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and fun. It's not terribly shocking at all, but it's interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen. The acting is brilliant around. Loretta Young is beautiful here in her prime. Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere how it can be. His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great as always, a staple of pre-codes and for good reason.
