Any film adaptation of a John Grisham story deserves a mainstream Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is about the last director to whom I would go for an overview on anything. But this southern fry pan boiler is very good. Although not among Altman's best, it's certainly not among the films he's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking. <br /> <br /> Altman had tilted his hat to the mystery thriller with noir nuances. before, in his 1973 film "The Long Goodbye." "The Gingerbread Man" is far from as good as the movie, but remains pretty much on its own. Kenneth Branagh is an arrogant lawyer framed for murder after engaging with a client (Embeth Davidtz), who enlisted his help to protect her from her cuckoo father (Robert Duvall). The film is set in Savannah, Georgia, as it approaches a tropical storm, which gives the film an oppressive atmosphere that I really enjoyed. The twists and turns around the end of the movie become more and more awkward, and Altman proves that he is not adept at major shootings, but overall the film is not a bad addition to Altman's canon. <br /> <br /> Also starring Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Grade: B
