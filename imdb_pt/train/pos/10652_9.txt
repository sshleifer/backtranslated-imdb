I do not know why critics destroyed this movie. I hardly agree with them anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been a little scarier - I do not usually go to horror movies! I even had to prepare to see him during the day. I need not have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh !;) ... Liam was great as always. I also enjoyed Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell). <br /> <br /> The house was very gothic and beautiful in a frightening way. The special effects and sound were incredible. I also loved the soundtrack, particularly the soft songs for Eleanor and her journey to save the children as she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally got her power, peace and freedom.
