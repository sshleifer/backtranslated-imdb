Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves to Manchester to stay close to his father. Along the way, he falls in love with Anna, a woman 20 years older, and who happens to be the wife of his new boss, Richard Crane. Despite the warnings of his new colleagues, Owen begins to get Anna for himself, going so far as to sabotage Anna and deceive Richard's marriage. This is a romantic drama with lots of humorous tones and a quick wit. The actors are superb: Green, from "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil," plays on the screen like the cunning and cordial Owen; Annis of "Dune" fame is lively and proves a good match for Green; Kitchen, from "To Play The King" is the right threat like Richard, whose comic errors and snobbery underscore his masterful and constructive hatred for Owen. This is a perfect love triangle, and despite the weaknesses and fallacies of our three characters, you do better by knowing and observing them.
