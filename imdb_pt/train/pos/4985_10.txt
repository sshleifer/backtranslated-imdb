People do not seem to give Lensman enough credit where it's due. Some issues have been overlooked, which are central to understanding the Lensman experience. <br /> <br /> The Year: For the year it was made (1984), Lensman presents some of the most impressive effects I've ever seen. As a person who watches the many animations of the early 1980s, Lensman is unique in his use of what appears to be a computer-generated image at a time when computers were extremely primitive. Kim's battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be considered a prime example of this. Every time I see I have to repeat to myself that it was 1984, when it was done. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack: Lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks I've ever heard, and this insane hysterical. The beat permeates every corner of the film. Lensman relied on two Western mistakes and managed to deal a little with the first - the need to fill every second of silence in a movie with music and the need for a heroine. While music tunes well and galvanizes scenes like the motorcycle battle at the Thionite Factory in Radelyx, the heroine's theme fails due to Chris's sheer nerve worth. It is interesting to note that constant music frustrated my attempts at noise suppression when I archived the analog tape lensman to the digital format - since there was not a single second of silence available for use as a reference point. <br /> <Western influences: Helmut - sounds like "helmet" and has more or less the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the SW Princess and her name sounds suspiciously like Marissa Fairborn from Transformers. Take the role of Han Solos flying on the ship and having a little technical knowledge. Buzzkirk - a definite improvement in Chewbaka. The lens - a good concrete copy of the force that appears less as a chance to preach Christianity in the audience than in the original SW. Although force depended much more on belief than concentration, the lens is a tool of pure concentration. Theoretically, anyone could handle the lens. The lens is much more limited than the Force - being purely a defensive / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: The boskone alliance has interesting meatball sponge boats. They look like stormtroopers with only red uniforms instead of white ones. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was good if it had only been developed. The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or whatever it was called - that 60's series in which they were fighting the Xylons). There was not enough ship to send battles for me - this is greatly improved in Lensman's second film. <br /> <br /> Finally, a note about Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character, who fortunately continues in the second film. <br /> <br />
