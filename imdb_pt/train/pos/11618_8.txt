Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. The dream team. This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A great plot. A great turnaround. A great eye drop. This is one of Wes Craven's greatest films, as well as "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street." This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), a troubled hotel manager, embarks on a delayed Red Eye back to Los Angeles. Little did she know that she was followed by Jack Ripper AKA Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They take a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane. He later reveals to her that he is a murderer who was sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security, which is staying at Lisa's hotel. And what does that have to Lisa. Well, she would have to move her room to the upper suite so they could bombard him if she did not kill Ripner his father (Brian Cox). The plot twist and presentation really does give extra zing, and the secondary characters and the secondary jokes actually add that. Overall, definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005. Definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 4 Star Rating
