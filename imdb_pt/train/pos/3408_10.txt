I give this movie an A + for his neat camp! As Dietrich's daughter Maria Riva wrote in the book about her mother: "If anyone sees the Garden of Allah in the context of the upper camp, it can be a lot of fun." It is like! I laughed with pleasure at exaggerated punctuation and in dialogue incredibly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic. Viewers who have read the accounts of Boyer's wig (which continues to melt in the heat) will laugh every time he shows up. Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when they give their speeches - instead, they look dreamily into the distance, presumably so that their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you is starring a turkey can also be good!). Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Travis Banton from Paramount and have him draw some of the most divine dresses, such as the beige chiffon dress and cape. <br /> <br /> I heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about Technicolor. It's really hard to believe the film was made in 1936 - the color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you attend The Garden of Allah with an indulgent attitude and embrace its foolishness, you can not help but enjoy.
