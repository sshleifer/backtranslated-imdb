I saw this movie in theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it then, and recently I even had a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year olds love this movie and have been asked repeatedly to watch it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching it again too. Although I have to admit it's not so good on a small TV. <br /> <br /> I do not have older children, so I do not know what they would think about it. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter keeps singing again and again. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
