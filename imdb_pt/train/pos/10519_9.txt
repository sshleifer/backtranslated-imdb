I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and besides being a feature film (a true fan wants to see as little as possible and this can only be achieved in a miniseries) was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the rich, slightly clueless, but well-meaning girl, and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightly with his posture and nobility. I was not thrilled with Ewan McGregor, although I really like him as an actor, but I felt nothing spoil the movie. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen, there were things I wish I had seen included, but that would have made it much longer than allowed for a feature film, and as it was, I felt like they really encapsulated the story . good. I saw all the adaptations of this book and felt this was the best!
