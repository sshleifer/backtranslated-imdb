"Gunga Din": one of the greatest adventure stories ever told! A story about the British foreign legion in nineteenth-century India and a humble "water carrier" named Gunga Din, a local dweller who aspires to be like his military colleagues; three British sergeants whose loyalty and camaraderie extend far beyond the limits of mere patriotism. His is a true and permanent friendship with each other and each would be willing to sacrifice his own life for the good of the other. Gunga Din wants to be a soldier too, a Bugler in particular, but can never reach that level because of his subordinate social position. However, heroes are not made according to their social credentials, they are made through their willingness to sacrifice for the greater good of others. Gunga Din tries every moment to prove his worth, but will he attain the level he so passionately seeks? ... "You're a better man than me, Gunga Din!" One of Hollywood's classics and a perfect 10 !!!!
