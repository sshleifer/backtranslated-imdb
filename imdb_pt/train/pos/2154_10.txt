I've seen this movie many times and I never get tired of it. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The movie is hysterically funny and still plays everything at the same time. For those of you who are not fans of "legends" or foreign films in general, open your mind. This is a great movie for "the beginner" because the story is so much fun. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and that's what makes it work), but everyone will get something out of it (even if it's just a big laugh with one of the main characters named Mr. Aoki - one of the funniest characters that I've seen!) <br /> <br /> I can not even think of this movie without smiling !! I love it ... and I think most people do too.
