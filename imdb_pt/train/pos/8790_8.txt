Hilarious movie. I saw this movie at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in 2002 and it laughs from beginning to end. The acting was subtle, but very funny. I'm not entirely sure about the influence of "Real World", we do not understand it here, but the film holds up without the understanding of this show. Heather B steals every scene in which she appears, most notably when she acts with her rarely spoken red co-star. Highly recommended. I would love to see this released on Video / DVD sometime in the future.
