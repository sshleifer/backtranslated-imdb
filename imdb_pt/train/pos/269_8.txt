I'm a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the good ones. The cast performances were very solid and there were twists that I did not see before every commercial. For me, it was kind of that Medium knows the CSI. <br /> <br /> Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I definitely watch it or rent it if I ever get to a video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was great. I did not see her in many things and she did her job very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you like mystery TV movies, see if you have a chance.
