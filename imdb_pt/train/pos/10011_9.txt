I really liked The Night Listener. It's one of the best movies of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the whole cast was very good. Everyone played just the right notes for their characters - not much or too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comedic touch. Toni Collette is great as Mom and never exceeds the top. Everyone is very believable. <br /> <br /> It's a short film, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the most disturbing images have been cut from the film. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and did it in a direct way, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days that seem to think The work is to impress the audience, instead of telling a story and count it well. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the views and advertisements. It's not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well. If you are expecting Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the film was the ending. The director might have left a little more to the public's imagination, but this is a small complaint.
