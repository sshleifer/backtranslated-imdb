The movie "Men in White" is definitely one of the funniest, if not the funniest, comedy movies I've ever watched! (and I watched a lot!) It's about two garbagemen, who become "Men in White" and then stop an invasion of space. It is also a parody of many classic films, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says that this movie is bad has something wrong with his head. There are tons of funny jokes and jokes here, and you may actually have injury to your mouth laughing a lot (happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you certainly will not regret it!
