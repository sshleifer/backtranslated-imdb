I remember seeing it years ago when it first came out and I was shocked by Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was really good too. For anyone who has spent too much time on the nightclub / after-hours scene, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not too serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posey definitely shines his talented way through this indie jewelry. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character Diaz (reminded me of every struggling DJ I've ever met). And many other films could follow the example of how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being annoying and boring about it. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
