I loved it a lot about this movie ... the time it took to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and the cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> combined intensity and lightness of touch that does not work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action movie. If we lived on Elizabethan days, I would say that this film is a bit like a tragedy of Shakespeare. But as we do not know, it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The film is clever in the way relationships and problems are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I think makes it more subtle and moving - and that also works well for a story based on a comic book or graphic novel. Sometimes I felt that it really was there in the 1930s, part of that story - there was such a realistic and at the same time dreamlike quality in the style of telling. <br /> <br /> I do not usually prefer to film the books on which they were based, but in this case I do. (I liked the book too.) I bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful comments. <br /> <br /> (I also got my little cousin, who is a bit younger than the boy in the movie, to see after I first saw it because he has problems at home and I wanted to use this as a way to start a discussion of father and son problems with him.-and the discussion.
