I saw this movie in True Movies (which automatically made me skeptical), but actually - it was good. Because? Not because of the incredible twists in the plot or the breathtaking dialogue (of which just recently), but because, in fact, despite what people say, I find the film accurate in its description of teenagers dealing with pregnancy. <br /> <br /> Dawson's Creek, they are not graceful, witty characters who flow through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They are children and act like children. <br /> <br /> They are blunt, clumsy and annoyingly confused about everything. Yes, this could be by chance and they could just be bad actors, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when not trying to be cool) a very convincing performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette is crying and annoying, but was she pregnant and a teenager? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on the pillow. The plot was very predictable and so what? I believed in them, their stress and their inability to cope - their bold, yet slightly misleading, attempts to bring them closer. I think the characters, represented by anyone else, would be really annoying and unbelievable, but they were not. This reflects the surreality of the situation in which they are, that he is sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby. I felt angry at her for this, I felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her. I felt it all. <br /> <br /> In the end, I loved it and would recommend it. <br /> <br /> Beware of the scene in which Dermot Mulroney runs from the disastrous counseling session - career performance.
