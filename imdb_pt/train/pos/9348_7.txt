What we have here is a situation. A man is found in danger and people want to help him - in contrasting ways. In the end, they are forced to let it go. You can not fix people. And though in many ways Reign Over Me is conventionally Hollywood, that message is not. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 airplane that has entered an almost psychotic state of PTSS ever since. It is about what Charlie does with Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), a dentist in New York who was his roommate in dentistry and, knowing of his tragedy, sees him on the street and reconnects. Charlie is walking on a small motorized toy scooter - a beautiful contraption to negotiate Manhattan traffic - with big headphones over a mass of rebellious hair. The hair is the main prop of Sandler to show that he is demented. And the use of music as an escape should hit all the subway pilots who carry iPods. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster, but paradoxically Alan, stuck with a controlling wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), soon gets his envy. Charlie is living like a crazy teenager with a huge trust fund, and starts dragging Alan to "go out", "eat Chinese", buy records or watch a Mel Brooks marathon at a fan's house . . Charlie lives in a beautiful apartment protected by an evil landlady, redoing the kitchen several times, collecting old vinyls from Springsteen, The Who, etc., and playing video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a giant screen in a large empty living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie's in-laws are deeply concerned about him, but also resentful, as we know later. Alan has a new patient who is proposing it. Charlie's despair makes us see Alan. Attempting to help Charlie, in part, allows Alan to escape his own stifling realities, but in part only makes him more aware of them. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler make a strange couple, but that does not matter, because it is convincing that both may need each other. Charlie is desperate for the company of a friend who has never met his family, because to escape his loss, he is pretending he never had one. And then, as a roommate, did Charlie slept naked and slept and had a bad taste in music (without Motown)? Alan wants an escape from his tidy and emasculating life. He is under the control not only of his wife, but of his dental partners, who dominate him, even though it is he who establishes the practice. They're white, by the way, and he's black. <br /> <br /> There is also the lascivious patient of hell, which seriously disturbs things in dental offices, but it begins to look different when Charlie arrives and realizes that she is a dear. His libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any moment. He is also attracted to Liv Tyler's breasts, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who start trying to treat Charlie when he admits he may need help. <br /> <br /> Sandler's crazy scenes are a bit theatrical, as are many of the plot devices (actually, this movie looks like a play in more than one spot), but it has several monologues where it expresses its sadness of forms that are deeply touching. <br /> <br /> Charlie is not just delirious and sad, but dangerous and violent, and all those efforts to help him start backfiring. The film is admirable in the way it conveys the feeling that people can not be right. This is an interesting film - sometimes touching - and it is the first time that September 11 is treated in terms of suffering for survivors. But there is an element of comedy that sometimes seems insipid, many people are very attracted, and the overly grandiose Hollywood interiors are horribly decorated; only the streets of Manhattan seem real. There is a court scene that is absurd, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is too good to be true. Alan's family problem is solved very easily with a phone call. And yet it pays to watch the performance - the control and subtlety of Cheadle, and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as what he had in P.T. Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love, from 2002, although it's clearly a better movie, actually a lot better.
