I am black American and I loved this novel. I watched this dubbed in Spanish on Telemundo, almost 5-7 years ago. The story was a TRUE story about a black slave who has a love affair with a white commander who led his leadership and sincere way of living. <br /> <br /> Many of us have learned a lot from XICA. She took what she had, nothing and saw her possibilities. Many would argue that she sold herself - but she was trying to secure her future and that of her future children. <br /> <br /> It was an excellent novel, which I thought would be released on DVD, but not being released. This novel was the best novel EVER. We need it to be released on DVD or broadcast on TV again. He's playing on Azteca America now, which is only available in Mexico or the US for cable paid. We need to release again to Telemundo.
