In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I've ever seen. I became an instant fan of Eddie after seeing Dress to Kill, but I must say I think this is your best job. I'd say though, if you get the chance to go see him live. Worth it! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, after seeing a stand-up routine a few times, the jokes start to get old. But I have to say, I've seen this show so many times that I literally have the whole thing memorized (yes, I realize it's kind of sad), but every joke still makes me laugh. This is a really good show. <br /> <br /> Dress to Kill will never grow old for me. I own it and watch it whenever I need a good laugh.
