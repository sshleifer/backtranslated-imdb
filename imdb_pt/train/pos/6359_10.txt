If you went to this movie to see a great presentation of the Academy Award ... oh well ... but if you wanted to see a funny adaptation of an old classic, you'll love it ... Jim Carey was amazing as always. The plot was great, some parts added as the story of the Grinch made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat .. But while there were some ADULT comments and added cleavage, this is supposed to be a show for kids or family. Try not to lose sight of that .. if you really do not like the movie ... and as for the comments on Ron Howard, try to drive a great movie and see how you do .. not easy as it seems ...
