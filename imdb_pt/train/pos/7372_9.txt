"This is not a love song" is a brilliant example of the kind of persecution that many people think has an underlying meaning. The love between the two main characters can be more than brotherly. I think Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see it. <br /> <br /> I really feel like this is portrayed with scenes like the sequences of blowing and writing letters. Heaton shows great intimacy about Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he takes great care when writing Spike's name on top of his letters. One thing I noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film was scheduled, the reviewer seems to have completely misunderstood the film because he did not even mention the possibility that Heaton might have sexual feelings for Spike . I also have the impression that some of the reviewers did not recognize him when they use phrases such as "Who is Heaton? What is he doing with a retard like Spike?" This person, however, may have nodded his head at his observation. Spike shows noticeable signs of having ADP, although I do not think that person has noticed this, since he seems to be using the word "retarded" as a pejorative term. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. Although not for the faint of heart. The film is extremely character-based, after the shooting to the end there is not much beyond dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you're used to watching movies so deep and violent, stay away.
