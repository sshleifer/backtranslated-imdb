If Jean Renoir's first film, Whirlpool of Fate, takes us first to the rural world, to the rivers, to the lives of the peasants he will continue to explore, it seems fitting that his second film deals, for the most part, with the film . rich and privileged, the upper classes and those who are trying to open up. Put the characters from the first two movies together and you'll have the seeds of your great "Great Illusion" and "Game Rules". This is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera making full use of the surprisingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the interior of the film, and the performance, although often exhausted, also offers great moments, particularly Werner Krauss' Muffat. But the glamorous and sensual Mrs. Hessling, who at first seems to give Louise Brooks a chance for her money in vampirism, never goes beyond a note, selfish portrait of a prostitute. Perhaps this is, in part, a problem with the script, which seems, for the most part, to seek high points and indignant emotions; not having read the novel, I'm not very clear whether the choices were well made or not. Even so, the differences between Nana's suitors are well-designed, and I especially liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo's Vandeuvres - the tragic understandings each one seems to have of their final destination and his sympathy for each other, particularly in the scene at the bottom of the huge staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat, and we wonder if violence will erupt - this and other drafts of the ridicule of the idle riches help to give the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement, and to me probably shy overall of "Whirlpool of Fate," this is still worth seeing for fans of Renoir or those interested in silent movies in general.
