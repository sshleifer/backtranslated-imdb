This movie is up there with the classics of all time. The music, camera photos and acting are excellent. Showing the black and white film gave it a much better look and complemented the music perfectly, like the Psycho. It's surprising how few people have commented on this movie. My guess is that it's a hard-to-find movie. I gave the movie a 9. Look at the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.
