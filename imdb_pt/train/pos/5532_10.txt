Maybe I'm biased for foxes, fox stories and all, but I thought this was done wonderfully. <br /> <br /> I really liked that this was shown when Lily was not comfortable, like the fire and the room (trying not to ruin too much here). I think it's important for children to see and try to understand. <br /> After reading some comments, I'm a bit confused, it is said that at the end of the week - the mother and son appear, as she has been the only one to tell the son about his story. The movie I saw did not have the mother or the son at the end, just a painting of a girl with a fox. Can someone clarify me about this? Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes might be a little slow, which can be difficult for high energy kids. Still worth it if they can stand still.
