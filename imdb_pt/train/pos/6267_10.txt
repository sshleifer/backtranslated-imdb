I thought the original of this movie was unique and charming, as well as sitting on the edge of my seat trying to understand. Since I had seen the original when I saw it Sci Fi Channel - I do not know if this remake was deliberately made for Sci Fi - I knew what it was in the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi as an actor, I wanted to see how he would do that. <br /> <br /> The writers / producers, etc., modernized the film trying to explain the situation of the "aliens." "(They could no longer reproduce their own type and needed help) using the same pseudoscience that was squeezed in our ears in the 1990s. Maybe it added a bit of polish to the film, or not. This original film ended with a confrontation between the young and the alien and a kind of understanding happened, although no resolution of the problem of Alienism. /> I kind of remember that in this remake, the woman became quite hostile towards the Burgi / Alien - I think it could have ended better. But the end is only the end, and the wire is a swell wire, being the base of the 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock A lot of great science fiction stories were written in the 1950s and some of them even got filmed. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing to watch as a rainy day or something. I appreciate this because of all the remakes of the an Sci Fi of the 50's, this one went well. I really enjoyed that a little. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really wants to see this story told WELL, I suggest the original 1958 version with Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, directed by Gene Fowler Jr.
