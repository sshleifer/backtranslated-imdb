Viewing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable movies are a rarity, when one appears as "Impulse," is something to embrace. The script is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give credible performances. This could have been interpreted as a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is far superior to any annoying "zombie", and originality shines in almost every scene. You get the feeling that something like this could have happened, even if the script is pure fiction. From the opening "grabber" to the credits, you will be fascinated. Very fun and definitely recommended. - MERK
