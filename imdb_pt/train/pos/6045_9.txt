I've also been in the movie, but I do not know if they really put that scene together. On the way back from a school trip (in 2005) we stopped at a gas station while making the movie, and were asked (all of us) to run and shout Go! Free Bird! We were all around 10 years old, could someone who saw the movie tell me if that part was actually kept in the movie, it would be great to know! I remember thinking the movie never came out, because it was two and a half years before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I think it was a successful movie, I can buy it, but first I'd like to know if I'm in it! : D Thank you
