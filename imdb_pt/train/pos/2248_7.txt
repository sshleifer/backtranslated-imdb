An amazing rental at a local video store, I was pleased to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers." And almost as disturbing. I think it went well with my view of being in late 2004, watching the Republican Machine do magic on most viewers in America. This raises the question "Are we really that manipulative?" <br /> <br /> It definitely distorted my vision. There was also a major theological question being raised-the story of Christ. Could it be word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on something exploitative like television to produce a messiah? Could the story of Christ have been exaggerated? Could it have been completely fabricated? It is something that the film puts in an extremely perceptive light.
