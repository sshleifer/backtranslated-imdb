This is widely seen in Australia as one of the best police dramas ever produced here ... and for my money, anywhere. It's raw, brave, the characters are real, the situations are believable and they do not run away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and criminals, victims, lawyers and others in their various orbits. <BR> This show lasted 2 seasons and was interrupted because the show did not sell well abroad. We all feel sorry for your loss: however, like Fawlty Towers, we can revere this as a uniformly high quality series.
