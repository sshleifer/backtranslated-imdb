This is an absurd black comedy from Belgium. Filmed perfectly in black and white, Beno√Æt Poelvoorde is in great shape as Roger, the angry and obsessive father of a family in a small and dreary Belgian mining town. Roger is a photographer who, along with his young daughter Luise, visits traffic accidents to take photos. He is also obsessed with winning a car entering a competition where the competitor has to break a record - and he decides that his son, Michel, should try to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him, it. Michel dresses up as Elvis and has a place on a radio show called "Cinema Lies," where he describes errors in movies. Luise is nice to neighbor Felix, a pigeon breeder. Roger is an insensitive figure as he pushes Michel to the limit during the record attempt, which almost results in his death. Intercalated throughout the film are surreal images like Magritte. It is undeniably charming and worth your time.
