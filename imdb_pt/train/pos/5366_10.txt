I'm here in November 2006 and I still can not stop talking about this movie. Arnold's best movies came in about a 4-5 year period. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are amazing. Arnold's extravagant liners in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion. I find the acting in this movie astonishingly good as was the case of Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job at trying to make the futuristic scenes as it is supposed to happen in 2017 but you can not help but laugh at the 80s style haircuts in the men and women in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the Running Man studio that we all know here in 2006 are coming out with the emergence of flat screen and HDTV. In addition, the computer graphics game "The Running Man," which shows the introduction, would not look like this in 2017. However, the plot is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this movie did I want to get up and not care about the ending, which is something I do often in today's movies. I really think that Arnold's performance is a lot better than he's credited. Now I would not have elected you Governor, but it's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are fantastic stalkers and I think the producers do not try to overdo the fight scenes. When the stalker is dead ... he's dead. Does not last 20 minutes each. The stalker scenes are fast and fun, but do not try and overdo it. I give this movie a 10/10 and it comes from someone who does not enjoy many movies nowadays. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphic displays you'd see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
