First of all I need to say that I am Portuguese and it is not normal for me to spend time watching Portuguese films, probably one every year or none at all ... <br /> <br /> And reason is the almost generalized idea among the Portuguese that the national images are terrible, very close to the worst ever made! However, in the last decade, it begins to surprise me when we recover the grace of the 1940s, when "Lion of the Star" and "Coast of the Castle" were among the best of their time, with films like "Pulsação Zero" or "Lute Nula, "both by director Fernando Fragata and also with some actors and songs in common. <br /> <br /> This is also good, not the same type, because it is not a real comedy; in fact, it is officially a drama, the drama of a woman has some unexpected funny parts, the cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them, such as the hypothetical trip to the Caribbean just to have sex. <br /> <br /> The plot works and may surprise us a few times; the actors are well, the regular venues as the score; but the truth is that everything makes sense, so we can count this as a good effort for national cinema, which seems to be starting from the ashes like the phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Portuguese film, you may have a better option, but it is still one to be measured.
