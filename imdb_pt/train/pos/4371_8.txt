When Braveheart first appeared, I was fascinated and was admitted as one of the film's most fanatical fans. When Rob Roy left, I was intrigued and although I liked the movie, I did not think it was a great movie. However, over time, my appreciation for Rob Roy has grown, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart has declined. Braveheart is great entertainment, for sure, but there are glitches too. The most significant, in my view, is the unflattering portrait of Robert the Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another is the historical inaccuracy of the film, which stains the film in proportion to the many historical distortions. I think I'm also bothered by the fact that it was in this film, seen only (at least for me) in retrospect, that the onset of Mel Gibson's egomania can be clearly seen for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy has grown with me over the years. Partly because it largely avoids the shortcomings that bother me the most in Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine, getting more mature and complex with each showing.
