The 60s are a great movie (I saw it completely in one night) about the hippy movement in the late 60s. Although the title suggests otherwise, the first 5 years of the 60s are not really important in this film. <br /> <br /> The main character in the film is Michael, a political activist who travels in the US against the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). He returns from the war and switches to a "Tom Cruise Born on July 4". in a father of Hippy.His is a pro-Vietnam war face (what a surprise !!) Michael's sister, Kate, gets pregnant by a Rock & Roll artist and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco during the summer of love . The ending is very bad (father becomes liberal and everyone is happy), but I let it escape my vote (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are very good and the soundtrack of the film is absolutely brilliant. All the major events of the sixties are in the movie, like the murders in JFK and Martin Luther King, as well as the great hippie protests, the summer of love and Woodstock! Look closely at Wavy "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid employee at the Woodstock festival! <br /> <br /> In the end, the 60's is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
