The fourth of the series "Dirty Harry," this film features one of the most despicable, ugly, unpleasant, profane and disgusting women I've ever seen in film: "Ray Perkins," played by Audrie Neenan. She is the modern and nasty low-life version of the character "Deviance" of 1945, "Ann Savage". <br /> <br /> His dirty mouth and attitude left me so much that I never watched this movie until a profanity filter than the creek ... and at least a little of it! So I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Everywhere that "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows ..... in a few minutes! It happens so often that it's almost laughable, but it makes a movie fun and fast, with a satisfying ending, as all the villains are eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very lush film that appeals to our basic instincts ..... and connects, sad to say. Most of us like to see those dirty balls in the end, and who does better than Dirty Harry?
