This is a great British film. A cleverly observed script with many quotable lines, it perfectly captures what magical mushrooms can do for a man over a weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is excellent along with most of the British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a based hanging out of his mouth is a master stroke and Gary Stretch with his pensive gaze brings something strangely atmospheric to the play. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, I think it will find a crowd out of it, purely on the premise that a lot of people were there and got the shirt. Also a great original soundtrack with a dazzling version of Freebird. This really could be a heir of the 21st century for the famous comedies of Ealing. Like the grass in the Welsh fields: it's a producer!
