There's a lot of crap out of Hollywood lately. <br /> <br /> A friend, sends me movies from time to time, as a surprise, it's incredible. <br /> <br /> I called and could not stop watching, it's a drama, but with a strange touch. Imagine if Romeo, as in Shakepeare, had a super power. It is sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood must take notice of the new Russian cinema, they are telling stories that are not about big bursts and cgi. It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story, without a show. This is very much like an Asian movie with a dark Russian touch. Granted is not perfect, but nothing is ever. You know what power is, but it is never explained, nor fully realized until the end. It becomes secondary to the thrill of the story. I do not want to see a remake, it's as cool as it is, the Hollywood system, as always, spoils everything. Acting is top notch everywhere. The direction and camera work is way above most of the crap out there. Congratulations to everyone involved, and I will direct a lot of people to this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find me, watch.
