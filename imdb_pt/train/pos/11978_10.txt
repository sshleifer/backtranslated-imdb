I love house so much that I could not live without full house. Why did it end? That really annoys the fan of that. Can we have a Full House II? Oh come on! But we'd better have this DVD to help us. But I need those real ones to get to another new episode. Love, heat filled the house! All the characters are very cute and cute! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, loooooooove you! DJ, Michelle, Stephanie, Danny, Joey and Jesse, please come back to the screen, please! How's Michelle after falling off a horse? How are Nicky and Alex? Is Joey alone or is he having a wife or at least a girlfriend? Are they still living in the same house? I want to continue the life of full house! and please do not bother me!
