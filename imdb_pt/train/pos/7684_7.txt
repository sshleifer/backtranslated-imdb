Reading all the reviews are very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist who painted the photos for the good transmission times. I realize everyone is referring to j.j. as the family artist, but there was a real family that has the real artist, and he has not received any credit in that regard. So if you do not mind if someone can say the real artist's name, I would also like to tell him "job well done". I know this vision is for the cast of good times, but you do not agree that it also touched the hearts of all of us. I wonder if he still paints or is still alive. I would like to have some of your works exhibited in my home.
