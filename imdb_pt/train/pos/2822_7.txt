The film Torrent was the first and last of Greta Garbo. It was her first American film at MGM, the only US studio she would ever work in. It was also the last time someone else was billed above her in credits, being her protagonist, Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the work of popular Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez Entre Naranjos. It is a pair of incompatible lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can not get together, mainly due to the machinations of Cortez's mother, Marta Mattox. <br /> <br /> Mattox is an evil woman who has some ideas about who her son should marry. Remember that this is Spain and such arranged marriages were still even in those times quite appropriate. Mattox has Gertrude Olmstead in mind as a daughter-in-law, she is the daughter of Mack Swain, a man rich in pig farming. Swain offers a few moments of comic relief with his concern for piglets before they turn into big, old pigs to be slaughtered. <br /> Blasco Ibanez had previous novels The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and Blood and Sand previously filmed with Rudolph Valentino in the lead. It might have been interesting if Valentino had done this to Garbo, but he could have been beyond the movies when this was done. In any case, one of the aspiring Valentino, Ricardo Cortez, fills the main role. <br /> <br /> One reason Valentino did not want this movie is because clearly the main character is Garbo unlike the other two works mentioned earlier. . When she is sued by Cortez, who is doing what Mattox and her "adviser" banker Tully Marshall tell her, she leaves Spain and goes to France, where she becomes a great opera star. And it takes quite a scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When she returns to Spain and tries to rekindle things, Mattox is even more indignant. She has a political career in mind for her son. Cortez is now competing for the Spanish Parliament, which curiously is called Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a flood and a broken dam, causing all kinds of damage in the field. Cortez actually faces the Torrent on a boat trying to rescue Garbo from danger. When they come together, they have a brutally frank discussion, the brutality coming from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here, however primitive they seem now, are remarkable in their time. They are very much like the shots used in 20th Century Fox's The Rains Came, which came out in 1939 and won an Oscar for Special Effects. Unfortunately for Torrent came out a year before the Oscars make their debut. <br /> <br /> I will not give up, so you'll have to see the movie to see if Cortez and Garbo are together. In the end. Garbo was rightly praised for her performance, and at a time when exaggerated gestures were the norm in silent screenplay, she was extremely subtle in her role. So, she would be the rest of her career, she had a remarkable face for closes. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo continued to do a much better job than Torrent, this film is still an appropriate debut for her. the American big screen and it holds up very well for today's audience.
