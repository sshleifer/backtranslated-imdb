Peter Falk is a diverse and talented actor. The film is well written and the acting looks like real life. For all Columbus lovers, this is a superior job. Because it shows the talent of Peter Falk. He does not play a detective, he plays a retired carpenter. By the time the credits start working, you'll want to watch it again. The interesting part of the film is that the message will be applied to all the people who watch it; the depth of its pertinence will be the only thing that varies. It's a shame that liberals in Hollywood only promote smut and skin, because that's the kind of movie the company people should be proud of. This would be a great movie to turn into a live theater play.
