I saw the movie recently and really enjoyed it. I was surprised and I cried. This movie is in the same niche as "Away from Her" - or even "The Bucket List", but deals with the whole aging issue with incredible authenticity. It's really very difficult to have the main character as unpleasant as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar is difficult to understand. Her world has strong edges and she is not an affectionate woman. <br /> <br /> The first scene does this without any commitment. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home for her son and daughter-in-law. She finds out en route and goes mad. Its edges are very difficult. She is bad. She is derogatory and selfish. She's a rock. I did not like her-not one bit. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, we have a vision. We find out why she does not like petunias because she favors a child over the other, how her losses shaped her character ... I started to see the angel ... and I began to like her. I especially liked her when she poured her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you're a brilliant actor. Kudos Kudos Kudos What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "feel good" movie, but it certainly is a film that takes the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother - she is not even my mother law or neighbor .. but parts of it are present in many women (and men) in my life. These parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've seen The Stone Angel.
