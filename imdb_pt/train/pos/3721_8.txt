This was one of the best war films I've ever seen, because it focuses on the characters more than in real war. The whole cast does a great job and because most of them are relatively unknown, it makes everything seem more believable. Camera footage is great, as is rhythm and editing. This movie will really reach you and make the public take care of the charcters.
