I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he is gorgeous with an incredible physique! He did a great job delivering his lines, as well as being George better than Fraser. Great performance for your first big release! This movie is full of hilarious scenes that every kid will love. My kids have watched this movie countless times since we bought the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the DVD extras are equally hilarious. Two thumbs up on this one! I recommend it to everyone!
