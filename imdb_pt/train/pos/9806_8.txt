I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I just watched this show by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was good to see Americans working abroad in London in the financial sector for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved all the other roles he has been. I can not believe the show lasted only 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's charming friend on the show. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or out of hours. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should have lasted longer, but the changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I did not like Sylvia, but I missed the actress Julia Phillips-Lane the previous season. I felt that this show took a chance and often worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or trying to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I liked to see Julia Ormond in an opening role. I felt this show should have lasted longer. I have sometimes felt that the views lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York and would have been a hit in the United States.
