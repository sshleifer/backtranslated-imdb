This movie is banned in almost every foreign country I can imagine. The Japanese people (?) What a star this must have been really desperate for a job, or we are just friends. Here's the hole: Three thugs torture the hell out of a defenseless woman, they use all sorts of things to eventually kill her, burn her, kick her, spin around a (more than 200 times!), they use the torture of sound (forcing them to hear a static sound for over 20 hours! It does not look too bad, but it can drive you crazy). They throw courage (probably from an animal) to her while she is knocked out, and she freaks when she wakes up. And who can forget the grand finale and the GREAT GOLD EYE TORTURE I've seen! <br /> <br /> If you have not heard of these movies, and watch one without knowing it is a simulated snuff film, you will think it is! (just ask Charlie Sheen) This is guaranteed to scare people and make some sick! Like I said pure underground. Check out whether you are a fan of underground terror or foreign gore. If you are not, I recommend you read the series before you watch! From the bloody aspect, shock and creativity, gets a 10, but from the plot and all the things that is a 1. A classic underground ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is 8/10 < br
