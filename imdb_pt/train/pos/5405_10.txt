My brother and I have Pokemon 4ever on DVD. We watched it like a couple of times and it was the best. Too bad a new Pokemon did not talk this time. I'll get used to it. <br /> <br /> The Masked Iron Looter was very stingy when he captured Celebi with his dark ball. Good Thing Ash and Sam were able to get him out of control. <br /> <br /> There was only one song in the final credits called Cele-BRATE played by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever has become a success since the previous three films and people will always love this movie.
