Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty movie. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful, but empty life. Really beautiful cinematography and sets, but Dietrich's chest of bottomless clothes are also fabulous. She is great; Boyer looks young and elegant. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman looking for meaning and a former priest in search of life seems rather outdated, but counteracting unrealistic scenarios and skies that somehow works, given the two stars, the fantastic score by Max Steiner, and a good supporting cast. The movie runs like 76 minutes and seems poorly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear. Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch, the dancer, John Carradine, the fortune teller, and Basil Rathbone plays .. .. well, I'm not sure. He just walks out of the desert and ruins everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert has been cast to star with Dietrich. I can not help thinking he would have been wonderful. The role of boris tired of the world would have been very good for the great Gilbert. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), her career may have come back on track. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any other 1930s film that Dietrich has done in color. She looks great and wears wonderful clothes. My favorite is Valentino as the Shiek-like outfit she wears in the pool. <br /> <br /> Certainly worth looking at the lush and color sets and the two big stars.
