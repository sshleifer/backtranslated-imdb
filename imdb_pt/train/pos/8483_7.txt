It is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable movie from the early sound era in terms that can be used for common movie commentary. Sometimes there is almost a desperation, as many silent-era moviegoers try their wings to the sound, certainly fearing that they will be put aside (as it happened to some), Rin-Tin-Tin. however, it was perfectly natural. In a vaudeville of unrelated sequences, some would surely highlight John Barrymore's soliloquy of Richard II, a moment that is certainly worth preserving. In general, only those with early-stage training exuded confidence. However, this is more than reasonably entertaining, and a must for the "movie fans", especially interested in the silence for the sound transition
