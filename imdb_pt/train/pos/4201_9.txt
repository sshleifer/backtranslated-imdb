Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by the independent film Samuel Fuller, contains an impressive opening that establishes a double complication. The subway rider (Susan Peters) collides with skipper Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark plunged into shadows of Sinatra). She does not know that she carries valuable microfilm; McCoy is not aware of raising it. Both are unaware of the possibility of being watched by two federal agents. Thus, griff sets in motion a certain degree of knowledge. Candy is doubly observed (Skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; Skip, the overly confident thief, is singularly unconscious, followed by federal agents; the feds, everyone knows, are ultimately helpless. They can not prevent the "passage" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
