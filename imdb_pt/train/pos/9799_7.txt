A nice animated feature from Batman. Not on par with "Return of the Joker" or "Mask of the Phantasm", but solid, however. I liked how the movie kept you guessing about who Batwoman was. There was a good turnaround. Good action sequences. I've always been of the opinion that Batman's designs are better than any of the lamentable sequences from the Batman live action movie. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10
