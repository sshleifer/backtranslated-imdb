I wanted to see this a long time ago, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie I thought it was a great accompaniment after that though, it started to creep. The acting and the direction were great. In fact, everything in the movie seemed to flow, except for the script. Sometimes the only thing that caught my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This movie was good but I expected more. <br /> <br /> Q. Look for great appearances by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
