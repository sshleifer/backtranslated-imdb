This series premiered on the cable television station "Comedy Central" in the United States. It was stung to death and shown out of sequence. This was sad for the audience that should have attracted, it did not happen and fell into oblivion. Fortunately, at the same time, my cable company was digital and I got the BBC. Thank God, because I have to see "The League of Gentlemen" in order, complete and uncut. <br /> <br /> The "Gentlemen's League" troupe is up there, with the "Flying Circus of Monty Python" from England, and "Children in the Hall" from Canada. But ... a warning. <br /> <br /> "The League of Gentlemen" though it is a step further. It is not just about dressing with drag and satirizing cultural evils, it goes deeper and deeper, much darker. I can tell many of you now - it will offend certain groups of people, it will infuriate others. But remember, it's your only comedy. Dark and dark comedy. If that's not your thing, do not watch it. If you think you know grim comedy, watch this - if you get angry and upset, then you do not know the DARK COMEDY well. <br /> <br /> These guys got it right, and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are great and I enjoyed the creation of each character. There is a complete story that is told here from the first episode to the end. You can not watch this episode at a time, whether you like it or not, which is one of the charms of this series. Watch in order. See how creative, stylish and deeply disturbed these faces are. No one and nothing is off limits. That, my dears, is "black humor." Angry!
