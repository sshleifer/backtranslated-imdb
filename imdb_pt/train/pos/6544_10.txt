I really liked this movie! Even though it was nothing like any of the books, it's still the classic Nancy Drew style. I was seeing a lot of advertisements for this movie, and since I really liked Nancy Drew's books, I had high expectations for this movie and they definitely met those expectations. Almost all the characters were exactly as I imagined them reading the books. I am very happy to have seen this movie. All the actors and actresses actually acted as they acted as in the book series. Since I saw this movie, I wanted to read every book by Nancy Drew out there. All the actors and actresses actually entered their characters and this definitely showed when the movie aired on the big screen. It definitely looked like all the actors and actresses were really in the positions where the characters were. I definitely give this film 10 out of 10.
