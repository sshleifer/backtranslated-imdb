Writer / director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his 2000 film "Panic," which includes his choice of cast: William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Donald Sutherland, and Barbara Bain. David Dorfman. Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly unfunny roles, and the eccentric cast is a welcome change from what we normally see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" is the story of a murderer, Alex (Macy) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He covers his true profession by doing the correspondence work; by all appearances, he and his wife (Ullman) and their son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with his life, Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (Ritter), counting only his mother (Bain). In the waiting room, he meets a young woman (Campbell) whom he is immediately attracted to, which further complicates his situation. His mother breaks her promise and tells her father about the psychiatrist. When Alex receives his next mission, he discovers that he must kill his psychiatrist. <br /> <br /> This is a deep story of a kind and good man, turned into a killer by a father monster, with his mother. knowledge, who kills to please his father, but also can not resist him and give up. His anger is so deep that he has lost his emotional connection with almost everything and everyone except his son - and it is finally his son that awakens him from almost lifelong repression. When it comes time for the "Panic" to move, it does - quickly. <br /> <br /> "Panic" does not seem to panic. In fact, it moves very slowly. But it moves slowly not because it is badly done - the slowness is deliberate, mirroring Alex's own psyche coming out slowly from the fog. In making a decision about Campbell's character Sarah, and seeing his mark, his own psychiatrist, as a living and breathing human being, Alex begins to make the connections between what he does and who he is and how they do not they do. jive And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche, Sammy's. <br /> <br /> William Macy gives another brilliant performance, as a loving father, a distant husband and a cold killer, the son of two children. monsters who have never cared a bit about their feelings or desires, a man who finally realizes he has to take a step forward or have the cycle repeated. <br /> <br /> This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. She's too adult, too small, too subtle, character-driven, and too good.
