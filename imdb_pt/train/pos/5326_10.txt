"Birth of the Beatles," as it was a North American television film released in the fall of 1979, has so far been the best film to tell the story of the four Liverpool boys who have revolutionized the music industry and the world. As told from the standpoint of former Beatle Pete Best. The performance of the entire cast is excellent, but especially the performance of Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by a Rock and Roll era legend, Dick Clark. Who a year earlier, in 1978, produced another TV movie, which passed the test of time, starring "Kurt Rusell" in the lead role on another musical legend; "ELVIS". This film was directed by an unknown director named "John Carpenter", who went on to direct other blockbuster movies, such as; "Halloween," "Escape From New York," and "The Thing." The same can be said of the director of the "Birth of the Beatles," Mr. Richard Marquand. He went on to direct other blockbuster theatrics, such as "The Return of the Star Wars", "The Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge" among many. The only other film that tells the story of the Fab Four I know is Back Beat, which had a theatrical release in 1994. However, critics did not care about this, nor did the public, for not having a long theater. The Beatles' birth is a very charming and simplistic film that gives you the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles and hardships they have gone through and ends at the pinnacle of success when they arrive in New York and appear on the show Ed Sullivan in 1964 I highly recommend this movie.
