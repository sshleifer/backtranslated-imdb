For all the miserable people who have done everything from complaining about dialogue, budget, gift and what ... who wants to hear it? If you missed the point of this movie beyond beauty, this is your loss. The rest of us who love this movie deeply do not care what you think. I am a fifty-something guy who has watched thousands of movies in my life, and this is in his own entity, in my book. It was not to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It's the most incredible love story ever tried. I know you're the cynic of the 90's and the millennium's all in a state of confusion, but come on. Someone in this comments forum complained that it made a lot of money! How lame is that? He made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the highest grossing film on the planet. I will gladly take the majority side this time. Cynic, time to crawl back under your rock, I'm done.
