Reign Over Me (titled after the who song) is a movie that will surely bring a tear to the eyes of almost everyone. It was a touching story of a guy (Sandler) who lost his family in the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center. Years later, he encounters a former college friend (cheadle) whom he does not even recognize because of the post-dramatic stress resulting from the loss of his family. The two revive their old friendship, and Cheadle's character, Johnson, realizes that he must have Sandler's character, Fineman, some help before it's too late. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie that made me cry in a long time. It's worth watching and, after seeing it, I'm sure the viewer will enjoy his or her family a lot more.
