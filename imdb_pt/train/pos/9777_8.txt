one of the best low budget films in Germany! Is this the dark side of the new era? If you believe in esoterism, please do not watch this movie! this removes all your positive fantasies. This film shows that beyond the peaceful facade of the quest for the spiritual soul is a world of extreme transgressions and terror. Hopefully soon there will be a 35mm copy! Andreas Marschall's first film is just the beginning of a new area, making movies with a few euros! I'm expecting the second hit!
