My dad grew up and grew up seeing George Reeves as Superman and when I was a kid he had episodes of VHS and let me watch them including that movie (passing them on to the family if you want), and I loved it. Clark and Lois Lane are sent to a town with an oil mine and the mine emerge radioactive men and target of the city, supposedly deadly, and it is up to Superman to stop it. <br /> <br /> It's so wonderful and fun to watch. The old style special effects and sound - the crew took off a beauty so with so little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a kid, and I'm 16 now, it just shows how these adventures are timeless and classic.
