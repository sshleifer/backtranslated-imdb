Hard to categorize the film - is it perhaps a cutting-edge espionage thriller? Mother Night is a great novel by Vonnegut and certainly one of her easiest novels to adapt to a feature film. The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. The "indie" approach to how this movie was produced is probably more effective than having a large Hollywood studio fund it. Nowadays, I doubt that a clever novel like Mother's Night would receive the green light of Hollywood's big grindhouses. And usually this is very bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has a steady direction and a solid cast. Nick Nolte, who seems to be getting better roles as he grows older, still has that "common man" personality that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as ever. I always thought she deserved better than getting out of the entertainment industry. I think making your debut as a dead girl (Twin Peaks) with little time in the air is not the best of the roles, even if the TV show becomes a minor phenomenon. Anyway, this movie is totally fun and you do not need to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the premise of the novel may seem dated, and some younger viewers with little history will be completely confused by the events in progress (I'm talking to you, fellow Americans who are students and scoring the the lowest industrialized world in geography, history and lord knows other subjects!).
