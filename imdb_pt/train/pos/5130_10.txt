... may seem exaggerated, but it is not. <br /> <br /> What's so hard to understand is - why did not they make shorter musicals like that? Was not the beauty of it all apparent to all involved? I think not. So many shorts were made just for commercial reasons and, with any luck, there might be some artistic value there. This is an exception - the only one? - where it looks like they were the director had a vision and could clearly enjoy music as art. Why did not anyone ever think about filming Lester or Charlie Parker at a live show? Crazy, man. <br /> <br /> Too bad there are no sequels. If you have ever seen something of similar quality, please share!
