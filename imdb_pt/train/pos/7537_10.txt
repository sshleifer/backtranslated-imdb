Unlike those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club provides real answers as well as inspiration. It also provides reliable news, logical commentary and a different view of what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think is best. Unlike other programs, which provide social and faith-related comments, those behind the 700 Club provide help to those who need it, such as feeding the hungry with Operation Blessing, providing medical help to those living in poor communities and give hope to those who need hope. It is not at all hateful. If the 700 Club offends you, I suggest picking up the remote and plugging the channel into your TV set. I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline News or, to that end, programs that I consider biased or offensive. What I find offensive is how the ABC Family inserts the notice that the Club 700's views do not reflect those of the ABC Family.
