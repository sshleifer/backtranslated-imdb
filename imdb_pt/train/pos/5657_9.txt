I remember watching the American Gothic when it first aired, it came to my mind recently, all I could remember was that the same guy appeared in the Midnight Caller, which is Gary Cole, I do not watch a lot of TV, but I I watched American Gothic, I bought the complete series on DVD this week, and it's still as good as ever, this is one of the best TV series of all time, the reason I do not watch too much TV is because it's just rubbish except by Derren Brown, is All reality shows or soaps, like Grease, Big Brother etc, I'm sick of it, I have the full series of American Gothic for Â£ 16.97 from Asda's website which is the cheapest I can find it.
