Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in show business. I read both his books and I think he's great. Peter Faulk can deliver a joke with the best of them. The combination of the two is magical. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family really getting to know each other. Through a car trip, father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midst of a family crisis. They do all the things that parents and children should do in life ... they are just doing them much later in life. The situations are very funny, but they have the feeling that they could really happen to people in real life (not overly exaggerated or caricatured). This is the first time I watch Paul Reiser and I fully believe in all the emotions that have been portrayed. Sometimes your eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret movie and great story and plot. It has comedy and emotion, but an uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas does a great job too :)
