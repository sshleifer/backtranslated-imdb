This film was not only one of John Ford's personal favorites but also numerous directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his high profile admirers. Ironically, I just spoke to him through Criterion's recent 2-Disc Set after losing some original videos on Italian television many years ago and again a few times on TV while I was in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The film marked the first of Ford's nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a quintessential example of Ford's folk American vein. A beautifully made and pictorially rather poetic piece of work, the court's (and eventually revelation) sequences in its second half still pack a major blow, as well as giving tough actor Donald Meek a memorable role as public prosecutor. Fonda, of course, is perfectly considered a shy, inexperienced, but rigorous, humanist lawyer who was destined to become president; Fonda would portray other fictional politicians on film - most notably in Franklin J. Schaffner's THE BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's 1964 FAIL-SAFE (1964) - and it is surprising to know that he was reluctant at the time in accepting the role of Lincoln since, in his opinion, this was "how to play God"! <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note here that Ford had already approached Abraham Lincoln (tangentially) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a superb but perhaps little-known gem, which fortunately has just been released . as a Special Edition DVD by the real stand-in of Criterion UK, the Masters of Cinema label from Eureka. In addition, I also have two more Abraham Lincoln movies in my DVD collection that I still have to watch and, incidentally, both were directed by DW Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) - and , I have not just received a lot of movies that I had never seen before, I would be happy to give them a turnaround based on my highly satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
