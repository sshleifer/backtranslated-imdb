This movie was a lot of fun. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well. The score is also uplifting and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The film is made from a mixture of traditional animation combined with computer-generated images. The result is truly impressive. I watch this movie at least once a week with my kids and we never get tired of it. The story is convincing and well told. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who would rate this movie under 7 years old. Definitely a keeper of my house.
