Bela Lugosi begins to play one of his rare roles as a young man in a series based on the long-running success of radio (which was also the source of a feature film in which Lugosi played the villain). Lugosi cuts a beautiful figure and it's sad that he could not get more roles where he could be the guy in charge in a good way. Here Chandu returns from the East in order to help Princess Nadji, who is being hunted by the cult leaders of Ubasti, who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of her cult. This is a good global trot series that is a lot of fun. To make sure the pace is a bit loose, more similar to one of the top studios (the production studios), then a thunderous adventure, but still nice. This works better than the two movies that were cut because it allows things to happen at their own pace, rather than feeling rushed or having the feeling that "hey I missed something." One of the trilogy of three good series of Lugosi, the others being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
