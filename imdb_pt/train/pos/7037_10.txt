This is a brilliant political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the US: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good film of that era, Rendition, was also totally discarded simply because it accurately showed. that the US is a war machine committed to torturing, murdering and maiming civilians in their quest for total world domination. <br /> <br /> A clever plot, good acting, some great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei?) And some hilarious scenes should have made this movie a success. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are accomplices to mass murders.
