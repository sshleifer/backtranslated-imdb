I went to the movies with two friends of mine and I chose this movie of the hat, totally without knowing what to expect. And this becomes a fun and fun experience! It's an excellent film with a very unexpected story, very good dialogue and crazy humor. All the characters are obviously done in the "Alan Ford" style, but that did not bother me for a second. In fact, this kind of loser training made the film quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell has played a very good and convincing role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant. But the real star is actually Guzman. He played a part of his life in this movie! The scene in which his character Cosimo dies in the film is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with it! Highly recommended to all "Alan Ford" fans!
