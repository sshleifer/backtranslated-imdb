Watching "The Fox and the Child" was a heady experience. The exuberant visuals, the integrity of the point of view and the absolute beauty of the scenery and the characters left me in a faint of pleasure. <br /> <br /> The plot is uncomplicated. Deceptively simple. Inside the container of this simplicity, a world unfolds and leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> I laughed. Cry. I learned. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you can trust - give yourself. I dare say that it is an act of love destined for any innocent heart. It strikes the heart of the spectator - of any age - and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art draws the viewer beyond the viewpoint of ecstatic participation in Reality. I feel that I had the privilege of watching - not, of participating - of this film, a true work of art.
