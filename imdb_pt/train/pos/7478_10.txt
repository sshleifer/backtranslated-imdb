I am from Romania and I will try to speak in English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my number one at all times. Viewed this above 30 times at least and will see this for many years now. It has all the little things I like in a movie, it's very touching it makes me cry. It shows a lot of distorted love stuff and questions about love and reality, and the real things that matter to different people. It turns out that for me that is what matters most, love, the soul of a man, he is the inner being, and this I see in this film. Maybe for me it's so much more than a movie, it's a proof in my mind that it can really exist and that you make the best of every moment that you live with your soul mate. It's a long road from reality to science fiction, but ... and if. And if all capitalism disappeared and the economy fell, would it fall? We would all be worried about other issues and my thinking is that on your deathbed, the most important thing you remember, is not the wealth, nor the adventure, nor the countries you visited and the people who remember you . But true friends and your true love and hope that after you die everything will be perfect and people would be good and care more. WATCH THIS MOVIE and probably it will guide you through your life as it did for me :) Hail from Romania
