This is one of the few movies I've watched twice in the theater. I really love this movie for its atmosphere and for telling the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes many mistakes, but gets a chance for redemption. Is not it a rather comforting thought? <br /> <br /> When I first watched, I thought that after the election won, the movie would end - I did not know the book. So kid, I was wrong when the dramatic climax was yet to come! I was literally taken away by the absolute power of the last half hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie. I can not understand it at all. Perhaps those who read the book first - as often with screenplay adaptations - simply disappoint that so many things have remained untold, unseen, unexplained. But like a movie telling a moving story - a family story, a man's rise and fall, a woman's deep compassion, the power of love and the insanity of hatred (and conservatism) - this film is simply splendid! Plus, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful too - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So, definitely one of those movies for which cinema was invented!
