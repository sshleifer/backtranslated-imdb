Very sweet pilot. The show smacks of Tim Burton's best films ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The cinematography, the narration, the music, the outer sets scream Tim Burton. There has to be a connection, or a STRONG influence, I just have not researched enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw in the forums, yes Anna Friel is playing with a poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen I see Zooey. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel does a great job. Your character is very sweet and kind and you easily cling to it. It's more of a distraction than I keep thinking "Why did not they get Zooey Deschanel?" <br /> <br /> Lee Pace does a great job too. I kept trying to remember where I knew him and just looked up. Wonders! Great short-lived series from 2004. If you like Pushing Daisies you MUST rent Wonderfalls, which is another creation by Brian Fuller. "Hmmmm <br /> <br /> I loved watching Swoosie Kurtz (World According to Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop of Horrors) again. Two actresses of understated character who never fail to bring it with their performances.
