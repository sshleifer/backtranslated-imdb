'Arms and the Man' is one of Shaw's funniest pieces, if handled properly, and this production does a good job. Helena Bonham-Carter, pre-film stardom, is Raina, daughter of a military family, who has a peacock of a fianc√© (Patrick Ryecart) and shelters an enemy soldier (Pip Torrens) during a raid on the city. <br /> <br /> Full of color and energy, this production is advancing at a good pace, and if Bonham-Carter and Patsy Kensit, as a maid, are somewhat overshadowed by the rest of the cast, they still hold ground. Kika Markham and Dinsdale Landen as the parents are delicious, and the whole game is usually a happy one. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
