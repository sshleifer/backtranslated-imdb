I think Alan Jacobs very accurate review about the film, however I had the opportunity to rent the blockbuster DVD with a commentary from BYU curator James D'Arc. The then Prophet Heber J. Grant approved the film by understanding the deviations from historical content to dramatic expression and telescopic events. For example, the film showed Joseph Smith on trial. despite the great oratory of Brigham Young in defense of Joseph Smith, he was condemned in any way. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith was never condemned for anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, where both died before the trial took place.
