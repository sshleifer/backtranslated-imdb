The fourth Pokemon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Do not you dare say Pokemon sucks! I do not like it when people say this .... I liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, please let's say that the Pokémon is great and should be enjoyed by people of all ages. And also, why do Pokemon enemies give low ratings to all or most of the Pokémon movies? I do not understand .... They should not do this .... There is absolutely no reason why people should vote without proving that the Pokemon sucks apart from the fact that: 1) Pokemon is only for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think that's why people do not like Pokemon.
