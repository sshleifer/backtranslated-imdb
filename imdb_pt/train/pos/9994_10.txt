"Life smells bad" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. The black and white always present in our lives. Mel Brooks' performance is as brilliant as ever, and the work of the other actors is also good. This movie has some Capra flavor, so it's so good. <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable jokes like the one in which Brooks tries to make money by dancing on the street, and all the people who pass by simply ignore him, or when he meets a crazy and funny man who believes he is Paul Getty and so start arguing and patting each other. <br /> <br /> If you still have not seen, you do not know what it is We did not see. <br /> <br /> This film tells of the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and reality is that this movie has a happy ending, and reality does not. <br /> <br /> Yes, indeed, Life Stinks.
