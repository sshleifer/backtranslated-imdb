A charming little film, sure, but well filmed. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this first showcase for her British accent, and the cast gathered around her beats the dialogue. This happened in the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I do not know why that person attracted all the Oscar attention. Emma is the most accessible and least muffled story of Jane Austen, told well.
