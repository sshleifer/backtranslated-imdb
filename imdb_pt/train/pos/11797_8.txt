Powers Booth is hypnotic as cult leader, Jim Jones, who led his followers at the People's Temple from 1953 to 1978 when he led them on a mass suicide in 1978 when more than 900 people died. A very well done film that may seem a little dated due to the time period of the 70s, but it's worth the time 8 of 10
