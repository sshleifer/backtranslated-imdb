I liked this movie kind of that reminded me of my wedding. It is very clean you can see with family. Well done. The songs are OK too. I think the writer's director is great. The film shows how marriages progress over time. They have couples in different stages of life and relationships in their life, the film beautifully portrays some parallel stages in the same story. Some of the dialog boxes are very good. The film portrays the complex human emotion very well, not with dramatization. Also shows perfect, after all is not so perfect. It shows very well the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new. The film is very well written and directed.
