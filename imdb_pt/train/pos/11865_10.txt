I heard some friends one day saying "Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to make another godfather in the early '80s." Now, I usually listen to idiots / watch CNN, so I decided to stay away from that. Then my friend handed me the DVD and said, "This is # 1 with the pelicangs," confused that I tried. This is the best movie ever made. It's more realistic than all that crap about stolen car racing that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There is some humor though ... ie the Pelicangs and the music of the 80's light. Still, what's better than Al Pacino wielding a m203? I give it a fucking bitch, perfect for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
