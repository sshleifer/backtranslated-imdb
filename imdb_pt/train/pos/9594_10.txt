Some are still very much alive and well, Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever, Willi Ninja is very talented and gives great support to the gay community as a whole, Pepper Labeija just passed last year of natural cause, That she rest in peace After Anji's death, Carmen became the mother of Xtravaganza's house (she was at the beach scene) and she is getting more and more beautiful. Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed, may all rest in peace. There is currently another ongoing project known as "How Do I See?", You can check the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
