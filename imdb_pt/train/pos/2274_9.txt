Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I did not know that one. The only reason I watched was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue and much more focus on the moral issue: in reading his anti-Semitic radio remarks with secret messages hidden from the Americans, he did in fact contribute to the general attitude of the Germans (and, the Jews or Hitler. Who carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent, for these words are never uttered, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not open, not even in his memories. The internal conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film succeeds. <br /> <br /> There are other points, such as humor or the ironic use of romantic clich√©s (like the White Christmas song), which make it very different from ordinary American films. I recommend everyone who is bored with Hollywood espionage movies.
