Malefy has practically the spectator from start to finish with his nervous atmosphere. Almost the entire film takes place in a prison cell that revolves around four characters, of whom the transvestite Marcus and his retarded little boy are the strangest. The detainees soon find a diary from a previous detainee behind a brick that deals with their obsession with occult themes and black magic that led to their escape from the cell. From here, everything deals with the discovery of the book's secret and its spells to escape from prison. This leads to some accidents at the cell's exit into the unknown light. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think the story is pretty poor and the final twist is good, but to me the ends are pretty loose. Anyway I was thrilled until the last moment, because the atmosphere of the film is unique, with minimal setup and cast. The killings are raw and sinister ... no gore is needed to cool the column and the hidden themes are also very well done and reminded me of Hellraiser themes in Hellraiser. Malefy has a claustrophic and cold dirty feeling with greenish tonality. Sometimes you wonder if the real or hidden world pictured here is weird ... when the retarded kid loses his fingers and is packed to sleep sucking on Marcus's breasts, it seems normal, then, how strange can be the glowing gates of freedom ? With its budget, the film creates a unique atmosphere and shivers the viewer in a very different way from most of the gender shocks. I just wanted the story to have led to a more consistent ending. Several elements such as the visitor with the camera, the obsession of others trapped by books and the toy puppet vaguely pointing to the end do not fit well into the story. Anyway, I'll keep my eyes open for other director Valette's films, although it's a turn-off to see that he's doing a Hollywood remake of "A Lost Call," which was already worn out and useless in the Miike version.
