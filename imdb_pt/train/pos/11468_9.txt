I'm frankly surprised by how little has been made in the movie about the Columbine massacre. There is not an important documentary, very intriguing. Fortunately we are graced with the talent of Ben Coccio, who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant, who made ELEPHANT equally good. Two different ideas about the event have in common the idea that the true cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there is something ultimately disconcerting and unknowable about the motivations of the two assassins, and what really drove them to take it, beyond fantasy in horrible reality. The ZERO DAY, supposedly made up of videotapes made by snipers and found after the event, is absolutely fascinating. Even if you know where you're going, you still have the hope that you DO NOT "go there" ... and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating. The film is fantastic from top to bottom, from director to screenplay (not too impromptu, although it seems very spontaneous) for the two main actors, and also for the supporting actors. There's only one aspect of ZERO DAY that bothered me. Ok, so we can not understand why the shooters would do what they did, but certainly one of the contributors was their ANGER. However, these boys do not seem really angry. They may say a few things to indicate they are, but in fact they did not convince me that they had something inside them that forced them to kill innocent people. But that still leaves me with the feeling of "why ???" that the director Coccio wants me to have. Either way, rent or buy this movie, it will approach you and stay with you for a long time. The BLAIR WITCH people could only WISH the kind of success these guys had in making a fake documentary.
