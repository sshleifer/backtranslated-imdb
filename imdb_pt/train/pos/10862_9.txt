The election is a Chinese Mafia movie or triads in this case. Every two years, an election is held to decide on a new leader, and at first it seems like a tie between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know him, "The Other Tony Leung") and Lok (Simon Yam, who was a judge in full contact!). Although once the Lok wins, Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes as long as he can to ensure recognition as the new leader. Unlike any other Asian movie I watch with gangsters, this is not an action movie. It has its bloody moments when needed, as in Goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. There are a lot of characters, which is very hard to keep up with, but I think this affects the madness of it all. A 100-year-old baton, which is the symbol of power I mentioned earlier, changes hands several times before things settle down. And while it may look like the movie ends at the 65 or 70 minute mark, there are still some big surprises waiting. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the photo. <br /> <br /> Election was the winner of the award at the Hong Kong Film Awards last year, winning the award for best actor (Tony Leung), best film, best director (Johnny To, who made Heroic Trio !!) , and best screenplay. He also had nominations for cinematography, editing, movie soundtrack (which I loved), and three more acting performances (including Yam).
