This is a beautiful movie. The true story of the bond between father and son. This is by far Tom Hanks at his best. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has the cool face papers. Still in this movie, he comes out in this movie as a bit brave but still emerge smelling like a rose, even to the last scene, the murder of his character. The cast of this movie was well assembled. I also love the part when there is total silence when the character of Tom Hanks shoots and kills all the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something chilling and deep in there being no sound in that scene, just emotion. I love the look of John Rooney, Paul Newman's character when he realizes before he even sees him, that it's Tom Hanks's character getting revenge, and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie, I was impressed and knew that I had to go out and get the video and since then add it to my collection of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, so this movie has a special place in me.
