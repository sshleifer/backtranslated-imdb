"The Lion King" is undoubtedly my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I figured maybe I should take a chance on the sequels and did it. Lion King 1 1/2 was very good and had good laughs and fun with Timon and Pumba. Only problem, I sometimes feel that explanations are not necessary because they can create plot loops and just the feeling of wanting their own explanation. Well, I highly recommend this movie to lion king fans or just one night with family. It's a fun movie with the same laughs and adorable characters as the first. So, hopefully, I'll achieve the same with the third installment of the Lion King series. Sit down and think only of Hakuna Matata! That means do not worry! <br /> <br /> 8/10
