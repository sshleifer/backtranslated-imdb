If you've seen the trailer for "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to see this movie. Regrettably, Renaissance had equally revealing trailer manufacturers. <br /> <br /> The story of the Renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young female medical researcher. The setting is a futuristic Paris, and the elements of science fiction appear everywhere. The special thing about the Renaissance, however, is its visual style, not its history. The Renaissance is a 3D animation, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylized in black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. The result looks impressive (although the 3D animation problems of humans are still noticeable from time to time: lightly robotic movements, light facial action on wood, etc.). As a highly stylized and beautiful film, Renaissance can impress the audience, especially visually. History and writing, however, are not on the same level of quality as visuals. Not a bad story (and presumably, if you have not seen the trailer, it's a lot more exciting than it was for me). But it's a story that is not very original, and borders the quarrelsome. Some lines of dialogue were painfully mushy, making writing sound like the first efforts of a beginner. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend the Renaissance to friends. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before, visually, and I believe that its originality alone makes it a worthwhile experience. It is also a watchable story, even if it is not perfect.
