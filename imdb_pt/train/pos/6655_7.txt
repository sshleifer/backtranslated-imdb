It's one of the best Indian films I've seen lately, rather than low-quality movies and music. All the actors showed the right emotions at the right intensity at the right time. It's the hallmark of a good movie, which makes the viewer come back and research the subject, what exactly did I do by checking Harilal. I've always liked Akshay Khanna's subtle acting style and, interestingly, he had a complicated relationship with his own father, Vinod Khanna, though not as dramatic as Gandhi, and I wonder how that helped him write that character. I was impressed by the direction and two thumbs up at Anil Kapoor for producing such a classic movie.
