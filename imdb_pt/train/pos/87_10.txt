This short Oscar-winning film may be among the biggest of its kind. Said completely without dialogue, it is a visual delight over a boy who buys a goldfish, lovingly puts it in a bowl and then leaves for school, leaving the goldfish unprotected and a window carelessly opened. After a while, a neighboring orange tabby appears, enters through the window and slowly heads for the bowl. The fish apparently knows something is happening and gets very excited. When the cat comes close to the bowl, the fish jumps. The cat catches the fish, throws it back into the bowl and exits out the window, as soon as the boy, without knowing what happened, returns. This was surprisingly filmed with real animals; How Cousteau got these animals to behave in this way is remarkable. I just wanted this movie to be available now for people to see; I only saw it once, in 1959, when it was originally released, but remained unforgettable.
