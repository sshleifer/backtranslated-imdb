As a lover of the surreal (in art and in cinema), I had the pleasure of discovering this film at the IFC. He is definitely a keeper. Most of the other reviews say the whole plot (not all correct), so I will not bother to bored anyone with this. The main thing is the concept of alternative worlds that is caused by Ana's impending illness, and the way she manages to connect with another person after being so "alone" and finally with her family, which I believe is still a little disturbed . It can only be called a horror movie in which it has scary scenes, but it's a fantasy (with a bit of "ripening" just because Ana is a pre-adolescent who "hates boys"). I wholeheartedly recommend it to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination.
