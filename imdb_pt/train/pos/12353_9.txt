A tragically wonderful film ... takes us to a Japan that no longer exists. Despite Hollywood's technical expertise, I still have to see a movie (hollywood) that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town near the river by the sea ... Tom Cruise's last Samurai looked like the last part of the Lord of the Os Rings in an attempt to capture the old rural Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like serene but intense stories, this is a must-see movie. It will be a truce of flashy movies much like the last thousand blockbusters you've seen. I think this is one of Kurosawa's best stories. <br /> <br /> Even if it's a movie about geisha and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such scenarios, it has not turned into a skin film. The characters are full of depth and act with great intensity.
