All the comments here on how much ZP misses plot, the acting is wood, the orgy scene does not make sense, etc., everyone misses the main point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. This is a film made in the heady times of the late 1960s and early 1970s in Los Angeles. It's a movie that must be seen while you're with H-I-G-H out of your mind on some psychedelic substance. Find some kind of bud and smoke, or get a mild acid hit. Seriously, these direct and sober criticisms of ZP do not understand. You can not take anything from this movie in a direct state of mind. <br /> <br /> Until you've watched this movie on the big screen (which I'm lucky to have done three times in the 90's when ZP was quite rare), you have no idea what this movie is . <br /> <br /> If you insist on seeing him not intoxicated, you can at least enjoy the ending when the crap explodes the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful re-working from "Careful With That Ax, Eugene," " Come at number 51, your time is up. "
