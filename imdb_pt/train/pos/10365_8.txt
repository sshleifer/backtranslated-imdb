This is a true story of an Australian couple accused of murder when their child child disappears. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages to keep our interest, despite interpreting a character that is not particularly kind. <br /> <br /> The media frenzy surrounding this case in Australia is reminiscent of Sam Sheppard. murder case in Ohio during the 1950s. These real-life situations demonstrate that the media can actually affect how a criminal case is handled. I remember the Cleveland Plain Dealer, with a huge headline saying, "Why is not Sam Sheppard in jail?" The prosecutor eventually succumbed to this relentless pressure and Sheppard was tried and convicted. Only after years in jail he was exonerated. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell a true story, I do it in an interesting way, and I make an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good films that tell the story of innocent people accused of crime include "Hurricane," "The Thin Blue Line," and "Breaker Morant." In particular, the latter is another Australian film that is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
