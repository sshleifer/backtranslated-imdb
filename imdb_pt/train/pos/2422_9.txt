Yes, it's low budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's earliest films, but it's perhaps the funniest of them! John Candy has not gone so far from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and it shows. If you do not fall apart when Candy tries to help a guy with his groceries while being handcuffed to a runaway cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with just the door of the apartment separating them (huh?, Watch the movie!), Or mode as Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) is talking to his mother on the phone, or just the countless number of facial expressions that only Candy can offer you to check your wrist better! If you like John Candy's "Only the Lonely", this may not be a movie that I advise you to watch, but if you enjoy the days of John Candy's SCTV, this movie is a must-see!
