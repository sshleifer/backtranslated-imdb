I first saw this movie in about 1990, and absolutely died laughing through it. It has become a cult favorite with my circle of friends, and we would quote it with a drop of hat ("I'm going home in a bag!"). Needless to say the mood is still there, 15 years later. It has become a tradition on Halloween to expose many of my new friends to this movie (good thing you can still buy it off Ebay!) I discovered that Halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue firmly planted on your cheek .. and this movie provides everything - ducks, suspense, unrequited love, nobility and the list goes on. Royal Dano provides sincere and surprising performance like the Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao" as a bad guy who met a bad ending. Here, you really feel for the old from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you are not careful, you will lose some of the moods in this movie. The creators were really subtle in many respects with improvised comments, subtle little costumes in other science fiction films, and even a scene ripped from the pages of Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Do not spend too many thought processes trying to analyze a movie, people - this is fun without the need for pickup, and should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they do not know who are being ridiculed). <br /> <br /> "Now if you'll excuse me, I'll get a 'Zag-nut' bar .... - Ramsay" RC "Cowlishaw, DJ / Karaoke animator
