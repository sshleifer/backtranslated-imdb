Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside his apartment one day. She decides to bring him and fix his cuts. She then leaves a note for him to eat some food she made and then go home because she had to go to work. When she gets home, however, she finds out he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live there with her as a brother or a cousin. In desperation to get him to leave, she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay. And as a pet, she says he would not have rights and would do what she told him. (not that perverted way!) To his surprise, he agrees and from then on he is known as Momo, his pet.
