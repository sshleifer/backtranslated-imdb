Disney (and the wonderful people at PIXAR, of course) offer a fun and enjoyable story combined with the best of computer animation. I admit that perhaps the 'faces' of the bugs were a bit more static than in 'Antz' and they had only four legs (in 'Antz' six ...). But the backgrounds were superb and the animation was breathtaking. But let that be a lesson: it was not the computer that made such success: it was the man behind the machine, who added the little twists I missed in 'Antz'. Some highlights were, of course, the "burning errors" at the end (So keep watching in the end, it's worth it!), Which were very fun and original. The "Filmed entirely on-site" line was designed for the most attentive viewer.
