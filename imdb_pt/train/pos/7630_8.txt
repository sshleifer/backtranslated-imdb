Kurt Russell, whose career began when he kicked REAL Elvis at Happened at the World's Fair, will probably never outgrow his performance as the King in this cut-and-hit carpenter-led biopic. There are times when you feel like you're watching Elvis until something brings you back to reality ... maybe memories of an unfortunate Don Johnson in Elvis and the Beauty Queen? All performances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right level of nervousness and hysteria to her interpretation of Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt's father, Bing, is playing Elvis's father, Vernon, and there is great discreet performance from Robert Gray as Elvis' friend and bodyguard, Red West. <br /> <br /> Must do for rock n roll fans.
