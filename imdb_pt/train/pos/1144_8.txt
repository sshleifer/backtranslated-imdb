As early as 1955, the British made a comedy called Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall. To this day, it is one of the best examples of British comedy and, more particularly, about how television comedies become so popular. It was, and is, an excellent example of self-referential cinema as well. So too, Soapdish, a movie that I had never heard of until a few nights ago when I saw him on TV late. I was a bit dubious at first, simply because the comedy is so hard to do well, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised and happy to watch a very clever satire on American TV during the day. In fact, it's been a while since I've laughed so hard. So, if you like satire, I recommend you to see. <br /> <br /> The leading actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey, and Cathy Moriarty? Simply do an excellent job, revealing how malicious and superficial the business of acting. As I watched, I kept thinking to myself: How much of this malice is transferred to real life? That is, if the actors have a real life? As you probably know, Peter Sellers, for example, was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters, so that no one really knew the real person. So while I was watching Sally Field playing Celeste Talbot playing Maggie, I thought back to that earlier British film with Kay Kendall playing Laura playing a character on a TV series opposite Peter Finch ... <br /> <br /> I wonder, Some actors have nervous breakdowns? And that feeling was crystallized when Celeste finally confronted her daughter (Lori, played by Elizabeth Shue) and, in an emotional moment, repeats the fictional lines she used in an earlier episode of her daytime soap, as she confronted her fictional daughter in E as soon as! You are confused? Well, it's not all like that, but the dialogue is impressive for the originality, comedy, vexation, anger, depravity, duplicity and even ... love. <br /> <br /> The story? Well, there are a lot of stories in this movie, all intertwined, and they come together at the end (of course, but not like a Robert Altman movie, okay!), And not all of them are finally solved. Life is not like that, right? The pace is almost frantic, and you really have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the subtle jokes and jokes. Spend the 97 minutes of your life and watch; you will not regret the use of time. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast performs well, though I've never been much to Whoopi Goldberg. Perhaps the funniest exchanges are between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and, for my money, the latter steals so many scenes from others, she gets my vote as the best player. I'm not joking, she gives the term whore a whole new face ...
