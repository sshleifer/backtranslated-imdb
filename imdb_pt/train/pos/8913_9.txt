This is my classic favorite. It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia, PA, when I was 13 years old, in 1957, and released the following year. Then in 1970, I found myself working in the same county as a rookie state cop. I always enjoyed checking the different places where the scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown Diner well, and he had a sign on the front that told all the drivers that this was the "bubble house." The theater scene was in Phoenixville near Valley Forge Park and is still showing movies today!
