Any child old enough to sit in front of a screen will be absolutely fascinated by the beautifully drawn images and the wonderful music in this sincere and funny rewriting of the Grimm fairy tale. They will be singing 'Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo' before even uttering a full sentence and will continue to sing until the days of death. It is a classic for all children, especially for adults who are young at heart.
