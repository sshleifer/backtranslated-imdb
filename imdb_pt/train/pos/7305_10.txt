In 1978, a phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenter's "Halloween" made people line up on the block to witness the evil Michael Meyers. Critics adored it, the world adored it, was imitated and became one of the greatest films in film history. <br /> <br /> Legend: 15 years after the murder, four friends (all women) are babysitting (and having it with their boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the night before, Michael Myers returns to his hometown to chase after these people. He kills 3 of them in silence and subtlety. He does not speak. He walks slowly. He hides ... <br /> <br /> Only one of the friends escapes, after being saved by Doctor Loomis (persecutor and doctor of Michael) <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Halloween works just as well. Simplicity. We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he kills, and he frightens us. That's the only reason we're scared. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote the film and directed. It builds an unbearable tension throughout history and it scares to the point that sometimes we can not watch. And the climax is truly amazing. <br /> <br /> To horror, this is essential. It is terrifying and well represented. It's also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a human. A force that can not be denied. <br /> <br /> The sequences centered around Michael and his "story". This film focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this thing is a masterpiece.
