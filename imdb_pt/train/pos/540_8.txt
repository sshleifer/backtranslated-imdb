actually ... that "video camera" effect, it's just that, it's an effect, a good one (you do not know much about directing a movie, do you?) this movie is actually BETTER than the original, it's very fun to watch, made for TV, does not need to follow any rules. I find it hard to watch number one because of how he kills the first girl, it's disturbing. and all the time we're directing Judd Nelson to get away, we as spectators are on his side. I hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake, but I doubt it. Watching this movie, you can understand how real movies are made, as this is like a movie inside a movie. Judd is one of the scariest villains of all time, and he is more realistic, he not only fades people as in other horrors.
