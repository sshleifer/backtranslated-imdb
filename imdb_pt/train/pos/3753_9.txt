This short film that inspired the soon to be released feature film - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that challenges similar cartoons that compose various writers. The short film starring Edward the Spatula, who after being fired from his job, joins in the fight against evil spoons. This premise allows for some fun content near the start, but is badly present for the rest of the feature. The 15-minute length of the film is absorbed by some strange ball comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately there is not much below it. The plot that is set up really does not have time to show. But it certainly follows the plot better than many high budget Hollywood films. This movie is worth watching at least a few times. Accept what is and do not expect a deep story.
