Are we actually doing 'nasties' video again? Under the guise of a large 8MM digital wide screen budget remake, this is quite a ride. Unfortunately, there is a little too much history and sometimes it becomes a travel script as the heroine turns the dark places of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am being rather coarse for the "depraved" scenes, including everything from hot wax, violent whipping to drowning, decapitation and others. These scenes are immaculate and it's a shame that Bruno and his budget have failed to make all creatures with personality introduced into more than simple caricatures.
