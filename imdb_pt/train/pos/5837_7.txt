With Oliver Hardy haunted by the sound of horns, bells, telephones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a goat's milk diet. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a boat anchored so the salty sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It's a great premise for all the crazy traps, as the boat is drifted by the hungry goat, and a convicted fugitive (Richard Cramer) creeps into the ride. <br /> <br /> I kicked all the jokes in the movie, starting with that plate at the horn testing factory - 'Silence while the men are working'. The initial story in the boys' apartment features a series of plumbing mishaps and mixed appliances, with Stan making a banana inside a piece of banana. Laurel has a couple of large lines in the picture, like "We must have been disconnected," but what made me roll was her response to the criminal aboard the ship - "Self-preservation is the last law of averages" - precisely! <br /> <br /> I'm not as good a student of the Laurel and Hardy films as many in this forum, all I know is that I liked them as a kid and found them as fun today as they were back in my youth. At that count, "Saps At Sea" provides a decent hour of fun with the Hornophobic, well on the way to the Hornomania.
