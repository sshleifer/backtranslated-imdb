Although time has revealed how some of the effects were made, this love-adventure story is still special. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie before, you will be shocked by how much later filmmakers have been stolen. I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much the Disney Aladdin was copied from the movie. They loved the movie and liked it to be a touchstone for so many other films and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I gave the film 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10, which is where a good part of this movie lies, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in rhythm. Everything is rushed as if they had suddenly come to an end. From the point of departure of the djinn to the end, it seems to be another sketch and then finish painting. It does not kill the movie, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> Still need viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.
