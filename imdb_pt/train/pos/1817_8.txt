All Dogs Go to Heaven touches the underworld of canine crime. The film is a delight to children with a comical and somber but satisfying and happy storyline with lots of music and dancing. He has Charlie, a canine criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who looks at him and through this relationship realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation that I loved a lot through my eyes as a child. I recommend this movie for kids. I'm not sure how adults would react to that. (I tried to watch a few years ago on VHS, but these recordings do not last very long, do they?)
