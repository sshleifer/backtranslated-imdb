Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman, presented in a full and very credible way, despite being so obtuse that it borders on implausibility. She will do anything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so, under the exterior of the vice, it reveals a fairly sweet value system. The film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending that then feels totally inadequate, with the familiar convenience of finishing the school's creative writing exercise with 'and then I woke up'. It's also a book on the other end, with the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but do not let any of it defy you.
