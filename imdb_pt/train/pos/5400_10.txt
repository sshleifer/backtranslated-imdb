This film is a brilliant lesson on Japanese history at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate shortly before the Xogunato lost a great battle against the legalist who wanted the emperor to return to the throne to rule Japan. I really had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (aka the original Zatoichi) gives a superb performance as Izo Okada, one of Bakumatsu's four Hitokiri (= Human Slayer). He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. To have a good life, he becomes a retainer of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke of Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultranationalist politician who allows his band of Hitokiri to assassinate many high-ranking pro-Western politicians in order to achieve their political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. As long as he has the money to go drink and spend with his whore. Okada's killings have become increasingly brutal throughout the film and he prides himself on having a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It is a splendid portrait of the life of a simple samurai who engages in political affairs and is really naive to realize what is happening. First after being betrayed and tortured and always having conversations with Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence) he changes his ideas and points of view about life. But too late ... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the team do a brilliant performance. Each actor achieves his role. The sword fight is very original and fast ... probably faster than several movies nowadays ... <br /> <br /> Take a look if you have the chance !!!
