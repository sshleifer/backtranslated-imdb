I saw this movie when I was traveling in Brazil. I found it difficult to really understand Brazilian culture and society, because it has many regional and class differences. Seeing this movie in SÃ£o Paulo was a revelation. It shows something of the daily life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, sometimes it is a bit dramatized. And that's the only negative comment I have about this movie. Sometimes it's a lot, a lot of sex, a lot of murder and a lot of cynicism for a movie. The director could film a few things a little more subtle, this would make the film more effective. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I liked the movie and the way the story unfolds. The characters are complex and very much like real-life people. They are not American actors and actresses with many cosmetics, but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the film realistic even when the story is not so convincing.
