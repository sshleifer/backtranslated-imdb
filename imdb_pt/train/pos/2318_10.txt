I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified myself with Reese Witherspoon's interpretation of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old girl in rural Louisiana around 1957. She feels she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen Emily Warfield ), and feeling out of place in terms of his conservative Baptist upbringing. Later, Court Foster, a seventeen year old (Jason London), the son of his mother's close friend (Gail Strickland) moves into the house next door, Dani experiences her first passion while Court enjoys her company and spirit willful. Dani gets his first kiss, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls headlong over her, leaving Dani behind. The close bond of the sisters is severely fractured by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when the Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls, then, are led to realize how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are perfect as loving parents, trying to balance the individuality of their daughters at the same time trying to keep them. the family together. The beautiful cinematography and the wonderful soundtrack of Elvis Presley, The Platters and many others contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere at a simpler time. <br /> <br /> A touching ripening movie with a timeless message.
