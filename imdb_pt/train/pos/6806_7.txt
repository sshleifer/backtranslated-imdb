Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of the time, made films full of beautiful scenes, delicate love and respect for all that is precious in life. <br /> <br /> Today, if people hear about him, they associate Marischka's name with the SISSI trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957). However, he made other excellent films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and definitely this, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing the young years of Queen Victoria. Although dealing with a slightly different theme from SISSI films, I do not see many differences between this film and SISSI. They are surprisingly similar. <br /> <br /> The film is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> The cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first leading roles. It was a beautiful introduction to her role as Sissi since this film was made a year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian Empress. It is also a movie in which Romy plays with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to launch Romy to play with his mother. Romy's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was also his performance with his mother. So there were some voices that Romy started his Austrian career on the bases of his mother's fame. In fact, there is some truth to this. <br /> <br /> Again, as in SISSI, this movie shows love very kindly. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small inn in Dover. His sympathy is based on the pure exaltation of dance and gentle smiles. And now...? How would it be shown? Just sex ... But is it the only thing love is based on? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call them kitsch, but I'll never give up admiring those movies. They are awesome !!! UNFORTUNATELY, HIGHLY SUBMITTED!
