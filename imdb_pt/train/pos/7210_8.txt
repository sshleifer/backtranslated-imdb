New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46 and is fading fast; When the film is released, Caine's last play is played on Broadway. TV critics scoff at Caine and he gets drunk. Passing the Long Island Railroad Road, Caine in Montauk, instead of your East Hampton residence. Finally arriving home, Caine is comforted by the wife of tight betrayal Dyan Cannon (as Myra), a heart patient unfortunately very nervous. There, Caine and Mrs. Cannon discuss a new play called "Deathtrap," written by young and handsome Christopher Reeve (as Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Caine's alumni. The couple believes that Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the hit needed to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "The trap is set for a perversely funny who's going to do it." <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's Broadway success does not stray too far from its source. The cast is fun and the twists in the story are still fascinating. One thing that did not work (for me) was the termination of the call; certainly played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; the performances are dead - but in retrospect, the greeting that Reeve gave Caine at the East Hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling "Hello." The location is not really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond seem similar. And, the very ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid. But the play was so good, "even a talented director could not ruin everything." And Mr. Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> ******** Deathtrap (19/3/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
