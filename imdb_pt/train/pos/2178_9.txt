With so much sunlight, transparent light and shadows filtering through windows and rooms, tracing photos through crowds with handheld camera, fast editing and extreme close-ups here and there, photography is the interesting, artistically made film thing. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie begins as a bit of fluff about a beauty pageant. The film begins on a hot Sunday at the local pool, where we find the lovely Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a sort of exhibitionist in front of the men stunned by the pool, she soon decides to enter to represent France in the beauty contest of the Miss Europe, to the great disgust of her very jealous and noisy fianc√© (a really annoying guy, actually). Strolling along the pavement, the ten contestants show up in bathing suits, while the winner is chosen as the competitor who receives the longest applause (I wondered, could not the girls walk more slowly to prolong their time - and thus applause) the catwalk? !). Lulu is soon being pursued by a prince and a maharajah, but her hot-headed boyfriend does not like the attentions she hears from other men or her adoring public, for that matter (I think he only wants her at home, cook his meals, and stay out of sight, huh?). <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps to enhance this film, but it's really the way it's photographed that interested me the most. A little distracted is the strange dubbed sound, which is a bit off. The print in this version seemed very clear and full of good contrast. Watching this, I tried to ignore the sound problems and watch the movie visually, and found the movie to be excellent, worth seeing.
