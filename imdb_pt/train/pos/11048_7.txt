I did not feel that this movie was as clever as it seemed to think it was, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> It's original, although it reminded me of two other French films, Vidocq and Ciudad de los Perdidas, mainly for the coloring, but also for the quality of the characters' closes. <br /> <br /> Situated in a prison cell, but do not let this put you off, this movie apparently goes further than many a multi-location blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with perennial 'Black Arts' well ahead and very good characterization making some very believable! <br /> <br /> Spooky with some blood, it's worth a visit.
