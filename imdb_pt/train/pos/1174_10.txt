Some people have stated that as of Season 11, South Park began a tendency to leave behind its politically scathing satire for the superficial parodies; but this could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Although this episode mimics the Living Dead series, there are more. It's a satire of how people treat the homeless. Characters say things like "They're pretending to be like us" or "They want to be human." This episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class, who are often just down on their luck. <br /> <br /> So, yes, it's still a satire, and also a wonderful parody. What more could you want?
