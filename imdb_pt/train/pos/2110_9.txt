Much has been written about the plot of the film, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the moody, bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction - what can I add? Just watch one of the moving, beautifully played and exciting scenes ever filmed. It's Christmas Eve and the character of Frank Morgan (the owner of the store - Mr. Matuschek) is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt. When each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each and every one of them politely refuses. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this stage, there is deep sorrow for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy ending to this very special scene. The new employee, the scout boy, is the last to leave the store for a beautiful snowy street scene. Desperately, Mr. Matuschek approaches this boy and asks how he would like to spend the night with him, he will treat you with all the wonderful Christmas food that this scrapbook boy has probably never seen! The guy is overwhelmed, he is also obviously lonely as Mr. Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you get the delicious DVD, watch the big trailer with Frank Morgan performing as Mr. Matuschek and an appearance by the film's director, the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This movie is a joy from beginning to end.
