All good movies "inspire" some direct to the imitation video movie. I was afraid that "Gladiator" was not really such a good movie, because I had not seen any movie that remotely reminded anything of Roman on the shelf of new releases for months. Then I saw the last offer of Full Moon, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Full Moon's Puppetmaster series, and Blood Dolls, but I've never seen one of his non-killer puppet movies. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus tells what happens to a group of campers in the Alps mountains. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with artifacts from ancient gladiators and feels compelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on. He becomes possessed and, like the demonic gladiator Tyrannus, is impelled to kill his friends to revive the corpse, which is the true Tyrant. <br /> <br /> Granted, like many Full Moon movies, this has little or no expense. Sometimes editing and directing were so amateurish that I would swear I was watching the Blair Witch project. Attempts to cut limbs and heads remind me of a Monty Python skit. The weapons, though seemingly real, look really plastic. It literally looks like it was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder over the weekend. It is true that there is nothing wrong with this type of film, just do not rent it, waiting for a technical masterpiece. It seems that there have been research attempts for the script as well, because although Tyranno does not really act much like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> All destroying, I really liked this movie. Not as much as a killer puppet movie, maybe, but Full Moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was that there was the Full Moon Videozone at the end!
