Following my experience in Finland for just over a week, I would say that this film portrays the nature of Finnish society very accurately. Especially the phenomenon of young couple-with-baby-having-serious-problems is very familiar to me, since I witnessed exactly the same thing when I was in Finland. The relations and problems of the people, the frailty of the matrimonial institution, the culture of consumption, unemployment and the growing monetary problem, are all very well placed, without any subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are some points in the text. films that are not necessarily easy to understand and link to each other, but the common picture is nonetheless rewarding. Not all the tales are exciting or profound, but, as stated above, the overall picture does not fail to convey the sense of "real life" and captivate the viewer. I think of a quiet moment: what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, that's what's happening. Movies like this are good for feeding your imaginative power. It would be safe to assume that this film could apply to life in many countries, but it reflects particularly Finland as it is, and very well. <br /> <br /> A comment about the acting: Being the fan of Finnish cinema I am, I have never seen any of these actors in any other film, but I found the acting in this film right next to perfect. It may not be a masterpiece, but a great attempt by the entire team. I'll be watching the future releases of the director and the cast. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
