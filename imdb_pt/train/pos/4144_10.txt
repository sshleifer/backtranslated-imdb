For a while I was caught in the trap where I watched myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I liked them. Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception. It is the truth. It's the best "bad" movie of all time. <br /> <br /> The "wickedness" of this movie seems to come naturally. Halfway through Satan's opening monologue, the word "Hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous Bridget is a bearded man in a wig and a thong dress. It takes the eccentric couple who keeps trying to kill each other to ALWAYS go down the stairs. Jesus walks to a funk soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost his mandate to advise a film project of a veteran. But it's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful. You get the impression that the manufacturers knew it would be bad, but they never enforced it. <br /> <br /> Never marvel at it, says Fatty. Highly recommended.
