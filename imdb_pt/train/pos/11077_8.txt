First of all, do not go into Revolver expecting another Snatch or Lock Stock, this is a different kind of gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the party the other night and this movie definitely divided the audience. It's the kind of movie where half the audience goes away thinking WHAT was that? That was horrible, and the other half goes away thinking WHAT was that? It was cool. Personally I like movies that I do not understand, namely Mullholland Drive and Suspects, so I liked Revolver. <br /> <br /> It was definitely not perfect. I've seen the great turnaround coming a mile away, at least part of it, and although sometimes some loose ends left unexplained are good, Revolver leaves MANY questions unexplained for no reason. In addition, some scenes, such as the animation, and the scene where Sorter kills (actually one of my favorites), though, amazing scenes to watch, seemed to be there because they were awesome to watch, not because they fit with the film. <br /> <br /> However, there were many good things too. I thought the acting was superb from all the major actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (which was a pleasant surprise). This movie definitely kept my interest, with a great scene of action-packed thriller, one after another. When Ray Liotta was being kept under the table, wow ... well, you gotta see. The script was extremely well done, and the soundtrack, like most of Guy Ritchie's movies, was great. <br /> <br /> Although a step below films like Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, it was still an incredible psychological and fast action movie with many twists and tons of scenes that you will remember long after the movie end.
