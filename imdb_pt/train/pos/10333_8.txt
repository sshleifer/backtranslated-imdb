This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is highly creative and openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the full extent of the death camps was revealed. While at the end of 1944 and in 1945 they would reveal how evil and horrible they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood films to date, is the most brutally honest film of the time I saw about the Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> The film begins in a court in the future - after the war is over (the movie was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictitious world court, a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one are called witnesses who reveal the life of Grimm since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. At first it seems that the movie will be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. However, after a while, it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are surprisingly well done and definitely catch their interest and also make the film look less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama. <br /> <br /> In general, the film does a great job considering the movie mainly stars second-tier actors. There are many attractive scenes and performances - especially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene in the end that can not help but let you close to tears. It was also interesting how around the same point in the movie there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way that you might not notice at first. Overall, it's a must see for history buffs and for anyone who wants to see a good movie. FYI - That does not mean a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler was called "that paper hanger." This is a reference to the myth that Hitler already made money by putting wallpaper. This is in fact NOT true - previously he had been a "hungry artist", homeless and served well in the German army in World War I. A horrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!
