The rating is only 5 because it is a movie that could have used better acting and direction (or at least music!). However, for Walt Whitman's achievements, he deserves a 10. An earlier poster calls the film tacky, however, I think it's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees. The filmmakers were apparently more interested in spreading the story than in having a brilliant Hollywood movie. And for that, I applaud them - the fact that it's not mainstream reflects Whitman's life as well. This film is more documentary than acting. Being fascinated by such a story, when you rarely hear of these kinds of stories that shape today's mental health, is the most important thing. I found a very nice look in the story.
