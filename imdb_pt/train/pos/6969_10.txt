First, this is an excellent series, although we have a kind of James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, Dr. No (1962) being the second, while in the Golden Eye, the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench is referred to as the new replacement for the "M" male, then how could she be in place before Bond became a double-zero, apart from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? This is more or less a "poetic" license to get excited about. We need to divert our heads a little if we want to have fun. No, the new Star Trek movie does not have any of the original electronic primitives of nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were fancy. (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. OMG, do you think 400 years from now, would they have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So, please, let's give the producers some room for maneuver. <br /> <br /> But to try to make things a bit consistent, let's think about creating the Cylons just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If that is the case, where did all the Cylons that populated the original land come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. Well, what happened if one of the Cyclon ships at war with the Caprica fleet was thrown or there was a sunspot or whatever and a ship, loaded with human-looking Cylons, ended up not just jumping in space, but through of the time a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One. They colonized it, discovered that they could repopulate it and ended up destroying themselves, but not before they themselves sent a fleet to look for the legendary Caprica, only to find a habitable but uninhabited planet that they colonized to become humans. , who eventually invented the Cylons. Time paradox? Clear. Which came first, the chicken or the road? Who cares? It is very fun!
