I am a university professor of 53 years. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all like the movie. The film is original, spirited, fast and totally charming. The plot was fairly easy for a 10-year-old but twisted enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest of the cast was fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should be. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, makeup, costumes, lighting, cinematography, editing and direction were excellent. All in all, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I'm disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult males) attacked the film wildly. Apparently, they have something against movies portraying strong, intelligent, independent young women. His writings reveal more about his own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family movie. I strongly recommend it to all children and parents.
