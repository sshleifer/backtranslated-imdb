I watched this movie waiting for what I got: good stuff from science fiction cowboy. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did a great job with an extremely limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to act under these two restrictions: you hardly have any dialogue, and because you are playing hard, military robot, you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat kind of ask a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and taped. Despite being verbally and expressly handcuffed, Russell makes an incredible characterization. Your robot becomes human, despite the restrictions. Great job! <br /> <br /> As always, Jason Isaacs guarantees that he will go down in history as a great portraitist of the consummate villain - the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, motherly and beautiful. I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much in her physical beauty, but it was hard to take her eyes off her. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was very small and limited. Much of the plot is quite normal with a fair amount of weaknesses, but since it has a science fiction comic feel, I do not see what's wrong with some weaknesses. At the end of the story, the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience gets a lot of emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> The kind of person who thinks Russell did not do a good job of acting is the same kind of person who missed the point.
