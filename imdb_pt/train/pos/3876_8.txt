The lovely Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this film from under everyone's noses, which is no small thing considering the great performances that surround her. Richter plays Anna, an out-of-work, independent-minded, neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who gets a job of desperation by looking after a dumb and mute wheelchair parent named Walentin ( the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who died at age 77 right after the film). <br /> <br /> <SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to respond to anyone - until he faces the talented Anna, whose flamboyant and malicious way brings back the poor old demon from a sentence of death self-imposed. The writer / director / actor Eric Clausen made a strong film about the difficulty of a burly son of an entrepreneur (Jorgen, played by Clausen) to love a father who never accepted him. The film goes to the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and affection, and how a person, the irrepressible Anna, can change the course of a human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance alone is worth the price of admission.
