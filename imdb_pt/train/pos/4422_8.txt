Well, if you're one of those Katana nuts (just like me), you'll surely enjoy this metaphysical samurai action spewing blood from the Katana. Starring Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) & Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha) This samurai war between the Heiki clan and the Genji clan touches the zenith in the final confrontation on the Gojo bridge. The count of bodies is uncountable. <br /> <br /> Demons, magic swords, Shinto priests versus Buddhist monks, and the fine visions of master Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese Flick for a rainy summer evening.
