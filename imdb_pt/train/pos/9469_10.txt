There is a scene in Dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can end the game of crosswords first. The answer to one of the clues is Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. This is exactly the case with Dan Burns (Steve Carell, the Office), a columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in giving advice to everyday life but he realizes that things are not so perfect for him. Dan in real life is amazing in capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful in embracing the comedy, tragedy and beauty of them all. Also, this movie is very hilarious. <br /> <br /> The death of his wife compels Dan to raise his three daughters alone ... each daughter in her own fundamental stages of life: the first eager to test her driver's license, the middle one in its phase of teenage angst and the youngest moving away from early childhood. Things change for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stumbles upon an intriguing woman in a bookstore. <br /> <br /> Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid embarrassing situations ... which is precisely what is in store when they are thrown in home of the Burns family. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, you know he's unparalleled with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well. Steve Carell is amazing at capturing all the emotions that come with family life: frustration and sincere compassion. The family, as well as the house itself, provides a welcoming environment for the film, which contrasts with the inner turmoil that builds up throughout the film and finally explodes into a full-blown climax. The film only falls short of some of the predictable results, but at the same time life is made of irony and predictability: which is an irony within itself. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life is definitely worth seeing, for the sole pleasure of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life, and I'll probably enjoy it a second time, or even a third. Just "put it on my account".
