DER TODESKING is not one of my favorite movies by Jorg Buttgereit - but it's still an interesting movie about suicide and its reasons and ramifications. Those who are looking for a NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM movie-style party or exploration are likely to be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an art-house style movie, so those who need linear and explicable narratives need not apply ... <br /> <br /> The basic concept of DER TODESKING is that there is a " episode "for Every day of the week that revolves around a strange chain that apparently drives people to commit suicide, interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse ... <br /> <br /> There are very well done scenes and instigating, including the man talking about the "problems" with his wife, and the concert massacre (which unfortunately lost some of its "power" on me because I was too busy laughing at the SCORPIONS-like band on stage ... ). But seriously - this is sometimes pretty (the scene that shows different angles of that immense bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the meaning of the scene, and the names shown are from people who actually committed suicide by jumping off the bridge ... .), sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (the SS brat is quite entertaining), sometimes distressing (I found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about the particularly effective wife) movie that is more of an "experience" than just entertainment, as many of these "art" movies should be. Still, I did not find DER TODESKING as strong as NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM, and would probably put it fairly on a par with NEKROMANTIK 2 in terms of my personal "level of pleasure." Definitely worth a look at any Buttgereit or fan of "art" movies. If you enjoy this kind of movie - see SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - in my opinion, the BEST art / horror movie I've seen. 7/10 for DER TODESKING
