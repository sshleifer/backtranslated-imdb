The King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is an incredibly beautiful and touching film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this movie based on a true story centers on Wang Bianlian, a street performer in the 1930s in China, who is aging but has no heir to broadcast his operatic art. He has a unique talent for quickly changing the masks in performance, and no one knows how he does it. He has an anxious desire to have a grandson, since his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. Then we go to the streets and see that people are selling their children because they can not take care of them: some are even begging to take their daughters free, because daughters are not worth much in this society. The story of Wang Bianlian continues from there. <br /> <br /> The film was so incredibly good, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so heavy and well handled. There is gender inequality and the depressing fact that in this time and place no one wants a little girl. It is also interesting to note that the famous opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman and, although he is famous and respected, he considers himself to be something low, half woman. As we move forward in the film, we face the issues of the slave trade and its demand, and therefore the lack of a possible solution to it, the brutality and corruption of the military and the police, the helplessness and the lack of power that any individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, performs yet another beautiful performance.
