As much as I enjoyed the Hanzo the Razor movies, three are definitely enough: 'Who's Got The Gold?', The ultimate adventure for the Japanese cop with the awesome package, is a pretty nice part of the Pinku movie theater, but it offers little new in terms of ideas, while taking a big step back from the outrageous. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the appearance of a female ghost, and looks like it will explore a supernatural territory, something that may have taken the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, after the ghost has become nothing more than a Scooby-Doo-style ruse (prepared by a corrupt Treasury official who wants to keep people away from the lake where he is hiding stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue refuses to recycle elements relatives. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanzo leads an investigation that forces him to interrogate women by using his powerful penis, slicing his enemies and abusing his superiors. Along the way, we have wild orgies, a good-natured rape (Hanzo imposes himself on women who end up enjoying his determination), and bloody sword fights. <br /> <br /> If you've seen and enjoyed the first two movies, you can watch this episode to complete the set, but be warned, this is probably the least satisfying of all. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.
