In Iran, the Islamic Revolution shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still continue to live their lives, usually just doing the things you expect, like going to football matches to cheer for the national team as it is competing to qualify for the World Cup. Except women can not go to the football stadium to watch the game. <br /> <br /> A small, often funny movie follows the small group of women who were caught entering the football stadium and the small group of bored. designated soldiers to store them in a retention pen on the outside of the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple desire of these women to cheer for the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches on the lives of all make up a beautiful commentary on humanity versus ideology. <br /> Amateur acting, good script and dialogue, a really fun movie. Bend It Like Beckham, kind - a warm heart and a joy in the interests and daily pleasures of people.
