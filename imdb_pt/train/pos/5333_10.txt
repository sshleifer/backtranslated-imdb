How this did not become a cult movie I do not know. I think it was sadly neglected as a truly ingenious comedy! "Fleeing Car" tries to pass through an accelerated thriller, but having the acting quality (good God, it's bad), the plot, the practical aspects of the demonic possession of the car and the scene of Evacuation of the baby into consideration there is nothing you can actually do other than laugh. And laugh you will. Movies are meant to entertain us, and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of the value of a movie. This movie is the apex of entertainment, I laughed from start to finish. At one point I was out of breath and almost choked, it's really funny at some points. When the baby was pulled from the sunroof of a helicopter with a pilot robot that managed to maintain a constant speed identical to the car and a plane of perfectly flat flight, which meant that the hook did not tear the roof of the car into pieces. I was laughing hysterically. But when the baby began to sway in the air, almost hit a bridge and almost curled up in a tree, tears streamed down my face. <br /> <br /> It also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played Jesus in Madonna's video "Like a Prayer." It seems to get everywhere.
