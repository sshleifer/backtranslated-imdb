Paperhouse is the most moving and moving film I have ever seen. Often classified as a "horror movie", I believe, is a grave error. Some journalists have called it the "nightmare of the thinking person," and although I accept the logic of its conclusion, I can not help thinking that it is a label that is misrecorded and misleading. Those who can only see the terror are really missing out here and serve only to demonstrate that they are not really thinking. <br /> <br /> In fact, just trying to rate this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Quite simply, Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than I once said, "the movie hits you on a completely emotional level," which may, in a way, explain why my comments are so relentlessly gushing. To be honest, I do not apologize for this, so if you feel that my words are too saccharinas for your taste, stop reading now because there is more to come. <br /> <br /> It is so rare to find a movie that has your heart, the pain and sorrow of childhood and the struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and solitude that can completely overwhelm us in this fragile moment of our lives. Even more unusual is finding child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence needed to make it all work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers, we had an inspired cast and Paperhouse's lasting impact owes much to his ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often forgotten) in a perfect and convincing way. <br /> <br /> And yet the two bright young stars seemed to have escaped from the studios and somehow disappeared. <br /> <br /> Add to this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose), an imaginative cinematography, and the most beautiful and amazing soundtrack you'll probably hear, and you can begin to realize why I have so much affection and affinity with this film that no amount of words can express. <br /> <br />
