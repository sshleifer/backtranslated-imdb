Modern, original and romantic history. <br /> <br /> Very good performance by Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman does a great job imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as the employee timid and dull. For men (and some women): Kidman's lack looks fantastic and is very friendly. I forgot what a beautiful woman she is. It's not hard to imagine John falling in love with her. Some unexpected twists in the story are good for suspense. Although I expected a happy ending, the last part of the film was a big surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: huit points.
