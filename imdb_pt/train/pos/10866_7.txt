Johnnie To's Election has some cool music in the opening credits and a nice opening credits design as well, a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mafiosos solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred things; In fact, the whole movie is well marked. I found about To Bishop Serafim Sigrist and was very eager to see a movie To. The one I started with, ELECTION, is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent by today's standards - moderately and also essentially violent; the story of an Asian godfather's plan, he uses a jigsaw puzzle of elements, violent facts of the life of the mafiosi, the race for the scepter, true details, and as with Coppola we must believe that some of the glamourous mobsters are titled and nice and nice . The performances are reasonably fun and colorful. <br /> <br /> ELECTION is well done in the pleasant and somewhat careless style of Hong Kong cuisine; the ending is bitter, true, direct and will scare the kids.
