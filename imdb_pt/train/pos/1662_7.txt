Artemisia's film can be considered treason, or as a real artistic license. <br /> <br /> What could anyone imagine? <br /> <br /> In documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to thumbscrews, and further stated that she was sorry, like Mary Garrard and Gloria. Steinem states eloquently. <br /> <br /> In the film, under a different torture, she refused to condemn her lover / rapist. <br /> <br /> How can a movie deviate so much from the received story? still inform the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is not so hard to find. In the film, the director and cast had filled a gap in the historical record with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> This led to a conclusion that differs from the record. <br /> <br /> So be it. I think both the record and the movie are compelling. Both in the film and in history, Artemisia was a painter, first of all. <br /> <br /> This vision, framed in sweeping (sic) cinematic composition, I am truly grateful. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie that compelled my eyes. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
