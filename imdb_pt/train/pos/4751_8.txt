I have no idea why this movie is being so mean by so many IMDb users (some are saying it's their "worst movie ever." What do you guys see Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite review is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all the action sequences. Duh! What the fuck were you expecting from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone invented the story and then just uploaded the action? Of course not! Black Mask is amazing, wall-to-wall action for almost anytime. It's also deliciously awful, and we have many severed limbs, beheadings and creative ways of seeing the bad guys (and some innocent people too!) Being slaughtered. Most of Li's other martial arts films are nursery school when compared to the Black Mask; there is no way to contain violence, bloodshed or free action sequences! And that made me a happy camper. Again: if you get into a Jet Li movie expecting a magnificent dialogue and intriguing plot, you're going for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his films (though beware of the horrendous dubbing).
