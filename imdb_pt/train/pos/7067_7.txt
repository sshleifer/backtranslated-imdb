Although she is little known today, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, a beautiful teenager with a cheerful personality and a much admired operatic voice. This 1937 was his first major film, and proved to be a box-office hit for the besieged Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> THREE SMART GIRLS refers to three daughters of a divorced couple who run to their longtime invisible father when infidel Mother reveals that he may marry soon - with the firm intention of undermining his girlfriend and return it to the mother. Although the story is light, the screenplay is witty and the expert cast plays it with a delicate touch. Durbin has a pleasant voice and attractive personality, and entertaining actors like Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer complete the cast. An ultra-light fun for fans of the 1930 movie. Gary F. Taylor, also known as GFT, Amazon Reviewer
