I had watched several days filming this movie in the summer, the end result was only two scenes in the movie. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the wagon, stop the wagon etc. So the young people from Dakota were eager to watch the movie and were not disappointed. The local herd of buffalo was being slaughtered, so the shooting scenes were real. (yes Doris, the animals were injured during the filming) I think the end was copied by Jack Nicholson in the Shining? A major social / western commentary from the 1950s. This must be from the same class as the High Noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause was for the youth of the 50's.
