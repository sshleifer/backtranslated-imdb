I'm surprised no one has mentioned that there are two versions of this same movie. The lion's share of filming in both is identical, but here's where they differ: in one version (the version I've seen on TV more often open), the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the "Brotherhood of the Protectors". , a dissident (fictional) group of priests and brothers "excommunicated" by the Church. In the other version, which I saw only once on TV, the clerics guarding the portal are described as priests of the official Church, ie the Archdiocese of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). In addition, in the previous version, in most of the relevant scenes, clerics are referred to as "brothers" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say "Father" so-and-so, but the dubbed audio says "Brother" <br /> <br /> In any case, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less partial re-filming of the other, with all the scenes of "Brotherhood of the Protector" re-filmed as "Archdiocese" scenes, or vice versa. (It reminds me of Raymond Burr's cut scenes in "Godzilla.") I've been filming both open TV versions, so no, I I'm not imagining this. Can anyone shed any more light on the story behind these two versions of the movie?
