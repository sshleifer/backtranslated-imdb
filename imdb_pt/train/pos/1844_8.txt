I was not sure if this would just be one of those idiot nightclubs that seem to mess up the prime time, but as it turns out, this is a very good show (not a little thanks to the talented casting). Four friends from diverse backgrounds gather and share the weekly events of their love lives. The hour-long program follows each of them separately through their often-erroneous missions to find love and does so without being boring or banal. Sharon Small's "Trudi" is the housewife (allegedly a widow after 9/11) who gets a bit depressed and irritating with her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors). It's great to see Small back on t.v., as she was great at "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". The girl can act. The character of Orla Brady (Siobhan, a lawyer) is perhaps the most impaired but still very sympathetic of women as she fights with her nice but selfish husband Hari (Jaffrey, ex-Spooks) in her desire to have a child with it, regardless of their needs. The last two members of the cast are the effervescent Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone, non-specific genre, and Katie (Sarah Parrish) a somber doctor who has affairs with a patient. his son sent his career and spiraling love life out of control. That said, I'm hooked now and I hope the BBC continues to launch this series because it's good, it's different and it has a great cast.
