Getting to the point: this is one of the most incredible and intense movies I have seen in a long time. The first film in years that left me absolutely baffled. I could barely feel my way out of the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I've been looking at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find a way to describe the power of this movie, and just failing. Highlight any aspect - the documentary-style video diary format, the inflexible portrayal of events, the strength of the characters - seems to simply trivialize everything. Some may find it ridiculous that any killer can be characterized as normal. But not all murderers are amazing lunatics in the mouth. Many are fairly regular and unpretentious people. They are only linked differently. <br /> <br /> And this is perhaps the most chilling thought of all.
