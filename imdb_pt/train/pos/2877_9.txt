I do not think I need to tell you the story. For it was said for years and years. So I'll just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. From then on I was a Disney kid in a good way. The animation now looks infantile and outdated, but that's part of its charm now. Now, in the era of High School Musical and computer generated images, it seems that people have forgotten the genius and the magical essence of the early Disney films. Luckily I was born before that, so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems like no matter how old I am, I go back to that five year old kid watching on VHS. What is the real magic of Disney.
