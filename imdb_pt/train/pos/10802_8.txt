I'm on the opposite side of the previous review. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think this was meant to be a direct sequel to "The Jerk." I mean, it's not titled "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too," which leads me to believe that although many of the characters' names are the same, it actually revolves around a completely different person . /> <br /> Think about it: There's virtually no connection to the previous film, beyond the names of the characters; a totally different story; different cast; and the fact of being a partial musical. <br /> <br /> I say give this movie some credit. He has lots of laughs in him ... Mark Blankfield at his peak.
