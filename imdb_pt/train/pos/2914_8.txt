Not many movies have been made about the lightest aspect of aviation, but this is one of them and it's very good. Just a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Most of the film takes place in the Navy's airship operations on the Lakehurst NAS (with NAS Tustin playing the role). Wallace Beery portrays a nice, but similar, head of Ned Trumpet, a enlisted pilot, whose high stories have become so frequent that no one believes him. Half the fun is near the end of the movie as events begin to prove that most of his more bizarre tales are really true. <br /> <br /> Placed during World War II, the main plot revolves around bachelor Trumpet courting a local widow only to end up having a father-son relationship with the widow's crippled son, Jess. He said he would never walk without crutches by the doctors, Boss Trumpet pulls a few strings, and a Navy surgeon helps restore the boy's crippled leg. Jess will join the Navy to become a flight officer, flying back into Lakehurst and facing a new set of challenges. A very well made film, though not without some tacky Hollywood dialogue slipping past the technical advisors, and Beery's apparent inability to march in step. Otherwise, this film gets good grades for technical accuracy and takes a rare look at the Navy's LTA operations. The cash register scene, an exchange between Trumpet and Jess's future love interest, Cathy, is an absolute joke.
