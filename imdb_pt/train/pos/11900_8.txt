Visually and musically impressive. A treat for the eye and ear. The quintessential Victorian element of the opening sequences was completely charming, helping to create a Christmas scene that Dickens himself would have been justifiably proud of. Technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are imaginatively designed and creatively achieved in a traditional setting. The dance of many of the leading artists is breathtaking. Photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the high general level of technical skills employed. A great movie for the whole family at Christmas time and a very enjoyable discovery that will support multiple viewing.
