Timeless musical gem with Gene Kelly in excellent shape, elegant direction of Vincente Minnelli and wonderful musical numbers. It's great entertainment from start to finish, one of those movies that people watch with a smile and say "they do not do like they used to!" But they never did just that. The 25-minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history. Magic of the film, clearly derived from the heart and soul of all involved. A must see!
