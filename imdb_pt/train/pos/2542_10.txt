With a special telescope, Dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in Africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) forms an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", even more powerful than radio and very radioactive, and Karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by touching them. The sparks actually fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science fiction movie during the post-World War II era. Director Hillyer used some sets of the "FLASH GORDON" series being filmed at the same time and also inserted some images of Frankenstein's electric machines. Universal kept the public unaware of the special effects used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were at their best and both enjoyed working together and will be appreciated by future generations.
