This can be difficult for some people to get in, getting used to the Hollywood production styles. The direction is uninspired, seemingly just a filming of the stage set up, and the audio quality is poor here and there (the rustling of people's clothes occasionally competes with their voices, etc.). <br /> <br /> Friends and I started to watch without knowing what to expect, and the first scene almost drove us away. Seemed very stagy and tacky. So we took the tone of the content, and really started to have fun. <br /> <br /> It's very funny, despite a bit of elegance. Definitely take a chance if you enjoy a great dialogue. Besides, Helena Bonham Carter is lovely, of course.
