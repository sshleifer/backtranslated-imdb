The Road Rovers was a great show about the canine superheroes chosen by Master to fight crime around the world. The show was hilarious to say the least. Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages. Running jokes throughout the series that could generate a drinking game. The action was mesmerizing and cleverly configured. The characters were very original, each with a very different personality. But what made me appreciate the show was the depth of the characters. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but implied in the subtext. Hopefully, someday, there will be some way to watch the Rovers in action again.
