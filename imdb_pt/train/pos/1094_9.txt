This is one of the few comedies I can watch over and over again and still laugh out loud. Elsewhere, I read complaints about racism and sexism from hypocritical and politically correct subjects. There is none here, unless you define sexism as a woman as a housewife and racism as a family employing a maid. <br /> <br /> Speeches are hilarious, and all connections have never been better. Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you have ever thought or tried to build a new home, you will be relieved to know that no matter how irritating the process is, no matter how much a lamb among wolves you can feel, you are not alone !
