He rented and watched this short work (<90 minutes). It is by far the best treatment that Modesty has received in films - and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees, participating as a "Creative Consultant." The character, and we who love, are treated with respect. Spiegel's direction is the best he's done so far, and the cast was very well done. Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect for Jim Holdaway's original Modesty illustrations. An excellent find from the one who launched it! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent. I hope Tarantino & co. will continue to do more in the series - I am especially interested to see who they would choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin!
