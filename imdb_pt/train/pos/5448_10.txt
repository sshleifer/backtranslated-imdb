This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is a comic genius. The rest of the cast is incredible, and the movie is actually very funny. A definitive satire of horror films, with a crazy twist. If you like a fun and comedy-filled evening, rent this classic. You'll laugh all the way!
