Fans of Giallo, look for this weird movie. It's well written and full of all kinds of low-life lives that people these movies. I do not want to give anything, so I will not say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you do not know what to expect or who to suspect. Recommended! The only place I saw to make this film in English is the European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
