At the time, I remember being rather surprised and amused by this movie. I referred to it as the most important movie I had seen in ten years, and found myself bumping into people who said things like that. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an uncommonly perceptive notebook. And it shaped the bitter teenage personality we all had in an adult and corrosive worldview. The two together provide an amazing mix that can be very edgy for some viewers. (Hi Skip, I wish you were not my brother, so I could fuck you up!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards searches for herself after returning to Los Angeles from New York, resulting in the immersion of trying on several people (all of which fit poorly) for our enjoyment, but many of them involve acting to appeal to a system of values ​​"black imperatives" that the true barometer of their resituation is if black culture accepts it. (It's been a while.) Nina Simone comes to mind, and she has an impressive black lover and solidly built in the film) A very dark girl attends the shows, and seems to be authorizing Sandra's false darkness, but ends up rejecting her. Just as Catholics consider themselves fortunate to suffer for Christ, here Sandra describes herself suffering at the hands of a black culture in which she longs for a place; as if she valued her dignity and her rejection. It is the only value system implied in the world of films, out of the artistic confusion of Bernhards. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main issues are racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of two topics dealt with in an atypical one. way.
