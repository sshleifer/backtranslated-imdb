A great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, the dances with a special mention for the "Portobello Ballet" are beautiful. As for the animated section, the game between animals became an instant classic; the climax with the armor attack is creepy and fascinating. I recommend seeing the restored version of 134 minutes or at least the video for 112 minutes. Here in Italy, we only have the 98 minute version, although the film was presented at its original launch with the duration of 117 minutes. If possible, watch also the German videotape: it was generated from the 98 minutes in a row, but is missing from all references to World War II and all scenes between English and Nazi invaders!
