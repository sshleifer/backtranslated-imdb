I went through "Bait" on the cable one night, so it started and I thought, "Hey, why not?" I'm glad I took a chance. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. She suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional stupidity. But overall, this movie worked. All the elements were aligned, and they took away what otherwise could have been a really ugly film. <br /> <br /> Most of this, I think, is due to Jamie Foxx. I do not know who scored Foxx for the lead, but whoever it was has made this movie a big favor. Beautiful and incredibly nice, Foxx slides through the movie, smooth as butter and funnier than hell. You can say that he is working on instinct, and instinct does not fail. <br /> <br /> The plot, though unimportant, really merges very well, and there is even a character arc by which Foxx's character grows as a person. . Once again, they could have escaped without any of this, but this makes things a lot better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the low score for this. Maybe I just got this move on the right night, or vice versa, but I'd give it a 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
