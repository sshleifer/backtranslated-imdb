Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and also inspires others. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson at Cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie. It is unfortunate that the Challenger Accident has delayed and harmed the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger Accident is coming. I had known one of Challenger's astronauts since childhood on the campus of Carnegie Mellon, where my father was studying; I also know a close friend of the final driver. <br /> <br /> I went through the technical review of the National BSA for the Scout Astronomy Merit Badge last year and I still find Spacecamp a great movie to recommend to the Merit Scouts associated with the space I teach. <br /> <br /> I found the astronaut late again as an adult and was following an engineering education schedule that we had ridden when Challenger exploded. I ended up sitting with Willard Rockwell and his "invisible" engineers reviewing things after the Astrotech Stockholder Accident as a result, so I'm much closer to the Accident and any cinematic similarities. I made sure I was a good student and finished the course four years later, oddly enough, at the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer who told them not to fly the Challenger in 1986 and later built Endeavor.
