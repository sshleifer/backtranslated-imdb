I absolutely love this movie and would really like to have it one day. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, I loved it and would love to see it again! I do not remember much about this, but that a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family, and I do not remember what happens, but he must go to the desert alone. His sister packs him some food and he goes. While he's out there, some other Indian boys come running and put some feathers in him, and he turns into an eagle. Legend has it that if you see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I have always been fascinated with legends, particularly Native American legends and I would love to see this ever released to a DVD, PLEASE FREE, whoever is worried!
