I went to see Antone Fisher not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke's acting work was excellent and the plot was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual fine job of acting and directing. This makes you realize that people with mental problems CAN be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this. Do not miss this one.
