One of my favorite movies. It has everything - rock soundtrack courtesy of Eddie Clark, ex Motorhead, lots of action, lots of laughs, totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful 80's stereotypes as characters. Eddie, the cool guy, who just wants to be left alone to be different, Leslie (as wet as they come), Nuke (the rock exhausted), Eddie's mother (pathetic), Roger (the geek) and Ozzy as the preacher (surely it exists in America?). Then there are the boys (rich, cruel and stupid) and the girls (vague, vain and stupid). What more could you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all there is Sammi Curr, the rock star, an amalgam of all the 80's rockers you can imagine. How about that rocket firing guitar? Then there is the scene in which Sammi pulls the old woman through the TV screen and breaks it down. And what does Roger do? Why, suck it, like a good geek would. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainey gets his reward from Sammi through his wet finger in the magic plug! <br /> <br /> If you were into rock in the 80's or just love ridiculous movies like me, then check out this one. It is available on DVD and very cheap so (trick or treat).
