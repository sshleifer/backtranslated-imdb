This movie is one of my favorites. It is a mixture of genre with ingredients of the genre Action- / Horror- / Romantic- / Comedy. Some of the special effects may seem out of date compared to modern standards. This little flaw is easily ignored. There is much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful it hurts. The visuals are beautiful too. The action is great, not surprisingly, it comes from Honkong, home to the best action movies in the world. Humor sometimes seems a bit silly, but in a good way. Somehow this film is able to balance the different moods and remains good. Absolutely recommended.
