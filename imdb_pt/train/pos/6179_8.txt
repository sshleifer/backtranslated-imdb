It is good to see that the Vintage Film Buff has correctly categorized its excellent DVD release as a "musical" because that is what the film is pure and simple. As her unofficial remake, Murder at the Windmill (1949), the murder plan is only an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading a cast of super-decorative girls including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace , Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also available to lend his strong voice to "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly the most popular song in the film, it is heard no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael, who steals the show, not only with his interpretation of "Sweet Marijauna", but his strong performance as the hero's rejected girlfriend. As for the rest of the cast, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen completely. The only good thing about the role of Oakie is his weak gag with the cult icon, Toby Wing. In fact, to give you an idea of ​​just how far the rest of the comedy is overly intentional and overly tense, Superman Inspector McLaglen simply can not get his hands on the killer, though, you would believe, in this case, which you suspect the most. Director Mitch Leisen goes to great lengths to point the killer to even the most idiotic member of the movie audience, giving the player a close-up after a close-up.
