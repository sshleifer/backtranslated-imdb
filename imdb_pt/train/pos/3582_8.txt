Here's another 80's movie that most people simply do not know exists. This slow, picturesque (the lovely pictures of Montana's landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of the recent "Open Range" by Costner, who also starred Robert Duval), and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect kind of film to watch late night when you can sleep or on an uninteresting Sunday afternoon. Those in the good mood will be treated with a detailed and intimate look at a family's pain and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son during the hunt. The performances are all top notch and discreetly nuanced. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect in their performances, as are all actors and young actors. I especially liked how director Cain (who unfortunately has not managed anything noteworthy since then, except the first "Young Guns") gives us calm glimpses of everyone's personal grief. We do not see just how death affects the younger brother or the parents, but also the confused middle sister, the rebel uncle, his crazy wife and the dead teenager's girlfriend. What we essentially get here is the Midwest's rural response to "Ordinary People." There are also tones from David Lynch's "The Straight Story," some of the stoic Mid-West morals of the people portrayed here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the land they inhabit. This is one of the best and most realistic "tear-jerkers" of the era, and a good little find for you quality movie hunters out there.
