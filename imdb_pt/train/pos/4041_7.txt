Tenshu is arrested and sentenced to death. When he survives electrocution, government officials give him the option of being electrocuted to a greater degree or agreeing with some experiments. He chooses experimentation and is placed in a large metal cell with an evil criminal who also survived electrocution. They can have whatever they want in the room (within reason), but they can not leave. after a few days, meals are reduced to one per day and the room temperature is also set to 100. After some alarms ring at intervals, they will not be able to sleep. One day, a 'witch' enters her cell (albeit a glazed portion). What happens next? I'll let you find out. I may be in the minority here, but I enjoyed the construction, it was intriguing to me. Now, if the reward was half the accumulation, I would rate it much higher. <br /> <br /> My Notes: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster's 2 DVD set Extras: Disc 1) Director's Cut; Trailers for "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the gas station" and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" Disc 2) Theatrical Cut; Commentary with Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Taku and Tsutomu Takahashi; Cast and crew interview; Realization of; Original Trailer; and promotional sings
