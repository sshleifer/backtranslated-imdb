This movie has everything, action, fight, dance, bull riding, music, pretty girls. This movie is an authentic look in the middle of America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. Lots of oil money, lots of women, and lots of honky tonks. Too bad they all left now. The film is essentially just another boy knows the girl, the boy loses the girl, the boy takes the girl back, but is redeemed by the actors and the music. There's absolutely no movie with better music than this movie, and that includes American Graffiti. It's a movie I watch over and over and I never get tired of it. Every time I watch, I'm young again, and it's time to leave. The only reason I only gave a 9 is because you can not rate a movie as zero, I do not feel you should rate a 10.
