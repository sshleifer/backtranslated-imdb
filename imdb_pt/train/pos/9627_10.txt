This is by far the funniest of the two comic geniuses. From the moment they enter, until Hardy just falls off the roof, it makes me laugh hysterically. I suggest all fans of Laurel and Hardy see that. I also recommend the whole Ghost series. If you are looking for laughs, watch this movie and you will be happy.
