By some happy coincidence in the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did Alfred Hitchcock's haunting masterpiece, "Vertigo," they also made that light comedy. Maybe the two actors needed to do it after being weighed down by the Hitchcock movie. Anyway, this is a great addition to "Vertigo" as it once again explores a very unlikely but powerful novel. In fact, the film can be seen as the other side of the "Vertigo" with its happy ending. Here again Novak undergoes a transformation, in Vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she 'transforms' from witch to mortal. Stewart is again bewitched and for some time tormented by his love for her. Unlike Vertigo, the two gather in "Bell Book and Candle," a perfect antidote to the hit movie. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are examined, but from a totally different vein. The cast is fantastic. Lemmon hilarious as warlock brother of Novak and Elsa Lancaster giving a classic performance as the aunt. Ernie Kovacs, as the writer of alcoholic worship and, of course, Hermoine Gingold, who plays in Novak's competitor, is great. The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is comedy at its best. Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even you have not seen this comedy light and memorable.
