May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for the historic appointment with Mussolini. Emotions, tensions and forms of self-affirmation. an empty city, a housewife and a journalist. The encounter of two different worlds. Refuge for a mother with a sad life. Short filling for a classic victim. A story about solitude and silence. On the form of nooks of life and desire as a form of struggle. The great character - a book given on a spring afternoon. This film is a poem, notable for the art of describing the shadows of ordinary solitude. A begging for an ineffable relationship with reality. And with your inner world. The photos of Il Duce, Antonietta's awkwardness, Gabriele's patience and frail tension, the art of directing to give the direction of script grace two great actors makes this film sublime, antecipated subtle delicacy, a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict, about the essence of life and repulsion of any tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of magnificent intelligent acting. A clear masterpiece.
