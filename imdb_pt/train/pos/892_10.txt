sammo must have 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has it all. great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the stick we have with food and fat. sammo assumes lau kar leung in a casino, sammo loses the fight but that fight is full of fast paced action and comedy elements released. <br /> <br /> Some great and touching moments in the movie, lam Ching Ying appears on one end and is dead out - gutted. <br /> <br /> The final sequence will get you to pick up the rewind button, since it's one of the best final fights I've ever seen. Sammo takes a lot of guys and ends up getting ready to bounce back.
