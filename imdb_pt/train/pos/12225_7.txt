I saw this movie and even though I knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still enjoyed watching it. I would recommend it to other people. Comes a lot in Lifetime's movie network. And I'm thinking it's close to Halloween that they can play more. So please be aware if you are interested in watching it. I believe Alicia Silverstone did her part very well. I really like her as an actress and person. She looks so cool and down to earth. Kevin Dillon, your performance was so much to me. I'm not trying to hit him or anything, but I believe his brother, Matt, would have been able to make this evil serial killer character better. Kevin looks very sweet to me. But I think he did well.
