In this marketing satire and 'lightness' of the war, John Cusack plays Brand Hauser, a killer sent to Turaqistan to defeat Omar Sharif, who is doing some oil deals that will cause problems for the former vice president of the government. US company. In addition, Hauser must reconcile his false position as a fair producer, a marriage to pop princess Yonica (Hillary Duff) and a meddlesome liberal journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> Technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - The acting (by the main characters, at least) was good, as you would expect. Some of John Cusack's dialogues were obviously not written for him, for he seemed uncomfortable to say so. . . perhaps unrealistic is more accurate. Joan presented a great and often hilarious performance. Marisa Tomei, although I've never been a big fan of her, was more than adequate for the role and worked well. Hillary Duff, however, was pretty awful. They needed an attractive pop-star from the Middle East (or Russian, or whatever the accent). Unfortunately, they went 0 for 3 with her. <br /> <br /> - As I said above, the writing seemed a little stiff and incompatible in points, especially the dialogue of John Cusack. Not much of that, mind, but some. The story also got a bit ridiculous on some points, which is good for a satire to some extent, but it took it to a whole new level here. Fortunately, the Cusacks and the Tomei maintain a relatively calm and calm demeanor throughout, and this makes a good mix of the movie madness and the high level of the actors. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, who once had a drought of real claims to his name, did a good job with a fairly broad spectrum film. He handled the small budget ($ 10 million) very well, stretching it to look like much more. Seftel also managed to mix the mood of the story well. . . with the painful and difficult parts of the real war (including the killing of civilians, etc.). <br /> <br /> - As for the general satire, your exaggerated look at the marketing of the war is very well done, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' ads in the US tanks. At times, it becomes a little too much, but in the end, you still need to portray what a young 'Mel Brooks' style is. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very well done for the lean budget and is definitely worth a look. It will not fall as one of the great satires of cinema, but certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
