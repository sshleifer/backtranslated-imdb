I saw this movie premiere Friday (1/19) night in Park City for Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in a theater and hearing firsthand the anguish that the soldiers face was almost more than I could bear. Others in the audience were equally moved, and although we wanted to get away, the least we could do was witness how these men and women shared their experience with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, all veterans of the war in Iraq and featured in the film, were present. While they may be at home now, you can say that this war is still within them and will probably always be. Whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
