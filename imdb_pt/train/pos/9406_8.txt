Other commentators have detailed the plot and social parables and commentaries as well (or better) than I could, but I would like to join in my admiration for this little gem of a movie. He stays very well, in fact, more than 50 years later in all categories - script, acting, photography, stage design, sound design ... it's really a classic of sorts. This was my first exposure to the "young" Alec Guinness, and it is obvious from the very first pictures which made him so special that he eventually received a knighthood. <br /> <br /> I just classify as an "8" because it is essentially a fairly light parable that examines human nature, but not the spike; and because the plot takes the easy way out in the end rather than actually resolving the conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and the industrialists who chase him around the city. In addition, a few minutes of thought reveal the basic flaw in the script's logic - wear and tear is rarely the determining factor in the purchase of new clothes (especially social clothing); children grow up, people change size, gain and lose weight, and wear the latest fashions all the time, and they have as much time as looms weave fabrics. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would make a fortune by supplying indestructible material for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> Still, this is a great movie. If you have the chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you should.
