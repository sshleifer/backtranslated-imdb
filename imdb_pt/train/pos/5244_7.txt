"The Ladies Man" suffers from a common problem among the "Saturday Night Live" skittles. And that is, a sketch that usually gets in five minutes will not be as good in ninety minutes. Although this movie has its laughs like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a sex maniac straight from the 70's, and Will Ferrell as a wrestling obsessed husband brought by Leon. So this movie is funny enough, but it's not "Wayne's World"!
