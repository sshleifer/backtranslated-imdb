The fear of a black hat is a hilarious parody of Hip-Hop culture. It's as funny as This Is Spinal Tap, if not more funny. The actors are amazing and the documentary style is superb. Mark Christopher Lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring many more films. This movie is a true cult classic!
