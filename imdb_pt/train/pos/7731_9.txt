<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange mixture of sensuality and stupidity. The movie runs slowly, very slowly, but it takes a rhythm to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man gives a true performance), and Rachel Ward is anything but sexy. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension, the psychological heat, the steps of the past ... the flashback scenes, the strangeness of the character of Patric, everything becomes a sexy mystery. I recommend this cause is the sexiest movie I have ever seen. Check out the lovemaking scene, it's particularly sexy.
