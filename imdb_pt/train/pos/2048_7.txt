A brutally depressing screenplay and some understated performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and a good location in Ohio, this great hard-hitting TV movie on the rustbelt. As factories close and jobs in labor unions disappear, the workers are threatened by all: administrators, owners, wives, and children. Strauss is completely believable in her role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before he gains weight. <br /> <br /> The result of heavy metal - was someone making a pun? - is sometimes intrusively annoying, but Frank Stanley's cinematography is knockout, particularly the scenes from the mill.
