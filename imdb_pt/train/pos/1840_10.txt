Great script and some of the best actors the world has ever produced. Montand gives the concept of police detective "lone wolf" a whole new dimension of intensity and, more importantly, credibility. <br /> <br /> When a typical Hollywood cop loses family, friends and pets to kill, he is usually given his minute of sorrow. But when the sixty seconds ends, he recovers, picks up his gun and happily shoots his enemies one by one. <br /> <br /> Marc Ferrot de Montand, however, is really devastated - with his girlfriends murdering, of course, but also discovering that she had another lover. In his confusion and anger he does not seek revenge, but must continue to find the true perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene. Thus, all your actions become inevitably logical. This is the main reason why this film sticks us into our seats, but it's definitely not the only one.
