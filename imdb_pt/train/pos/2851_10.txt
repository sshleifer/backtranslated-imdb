Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost throughout the film, chasing one another due to strange circumstances and comic coincidence. While they are running, we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment. Running is a metaphor for these unlucky lives. Somehow, what they are really looking for is not what they were originally pursuing but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes everyone feel truly alive. The great life-changing racing adventure comes to an end when it accidentally enters into something big, violent and so absurd that it's funny in a clever way. One of my favorite movies of all time by the brilliant director Sabu.
