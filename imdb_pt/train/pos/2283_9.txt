I have not yet read the book of Kurt Vonnegut for which it was adapted, but I am familiar with some of his other works and was interested in seeing how it would be translated to the screen. Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It concerns the story of an American who lives in Germany and is recruited as a spy for the US. His job is to please high-ranking Nazis and send secret messages to the Americans through his weekly radio program. But when the war ends, he is denounced as a war criminal, but flees to New York, where several curious twists await you. <br /> <br /> If Mother's Night has a problem, it's a bit too sentimental. times. But for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is performed with skill and resourcefulness. And there are some fabulous moments of dark comedy involving three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a highly classified Nazi in a prison cell. Very recommended.
