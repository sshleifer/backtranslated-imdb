I saw Soylent Green in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on TV or video. It's always been one of my favorite science fiction films and / or Charlton Heston. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Egyptian theater in LA had a retrospective of twelve Charlton Heston films. I flew out of state to see six of the movies over a period of two days. Soylent Green looked great on the big Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. From the initial assembly to the home scene, to the finale, the film was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog-eating dog world with few natural resources and no understanding of how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film also looks much better on a great 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and cinematography, writing, music used and everything about it works. The film is also very powerful in its dark vision and very possible of the future. Just think of how the world's population has grown, the rainforest that has disappeared, the depleted resources, the greenhouse effect worsening since 1973. I just wonder why this movie has not touched the theaters all these years. Your reputation should be better. Speaking of reputation, people often talk as if Charlton Heston was not a great actor. Seeing him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Dundee back to back, I'm convinced he's one of our best actors. Of course he's made about a dozen other great movies and for those who care, you know what they are. <br /> <br />
