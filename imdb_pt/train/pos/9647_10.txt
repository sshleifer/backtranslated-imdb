Deeply emotional. It can not leave you neutral. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a love story between two 18-year-old boys. But it's just the body of this movie. And it was removed. You just feel what happened to these boys. You feel the soul of the movie. Of course, some action, a little sex, but this is not pornography, many feelings. <br /> <br /> It was just a summer "story," and it became, from love of hate, almost to death, the most important moment of their lives. I loved you, too, whatever your feelings.
