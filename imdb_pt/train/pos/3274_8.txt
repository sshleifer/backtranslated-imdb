This is one of the three 1980s films that I can think of that were sadly neglected at the time and, unfortunately, still forgotten. One of the others was Clownhouse, directed by Victor Salva, a film horribly ignored due to the legal / sexual problems of Salva. Another would be Closet Cameron which seems to me a bit understated - not great but not as bad as the reviews I've seen. Paper House is well worth your time and I think it's one of those very quiet movies that will stay in your brain for much longer than you think. I mean, 10 years after I saw it and still take a break, while something I could have seen 6 months ago went into the ether.
