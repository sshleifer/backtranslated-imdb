It takes a very special kind of person to make such a miserable, seductive, disgusting and repulsive movie, but do it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic release. Crispin Glover, in all his antics and predispositions, really did something that is unique. In a world that has become totally partisan, this movie seems to escape the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively surprise everyone. Soon enough, the film takes on a rather distant paradigm (if there really is a model) and initially shapes it with the likes of Shirley Temple in front of a swastika and naked women giving pleasure a man with paralysis cerebral. It's a pretty shocking thing, but if you've had the opportunity for question and answer sessions after the exhibits, this clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering if this is art or just the smallest common denominator. Either way, you feel the tremor that this movie will eventually cause. It will never be accepted, not even by the supposed authors of the world who speak bitterly about the human condition. You may not like it, but it's certainly something worth watching.
