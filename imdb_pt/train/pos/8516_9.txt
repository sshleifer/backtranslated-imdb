This film is an extremely funny and moving story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his father agrees to intervene temporarily to manage things. <br /> <br /> This is positively the best job Leslie Nielson has ever done. Your idea in the movie to rent children is immediately groundbreaking, and your sales techniques will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. . Just make sure you do not miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> This great family entertainment is so rare nowadays. If you go to photos a bit mushy with happy endings, go for this one! I could watch it again and again, and I often do it! My only complaint about this movie is that it's so hard to find a copy.
