Yes ... I'm going with 1-0 on this and here's why. In recent years I have watched a few comedies and only came away with a few light laughs and some late video rental fees because the movies were easy to forget. Then I come across "nothing." It sounded interesting but did not expect much. I was wrong. This was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a great comedic couple and the humor was captivating enough to remember, but not complex enough to miss the joke. I do not want to comment on any of the actual scenes because I feel like this is a movie worth seeing for the first time. With more and more useless concepts getting into the movies (like murderous military jets and "new" remakes that are ruining old classics), this movie will make you happy to say it's okay to laugh at "Nothing."
