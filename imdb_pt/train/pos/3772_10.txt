The false journey of Bill and Ted is the most excellent film I have ever seen. Although the performance and setting etc. be bad, who cares. The plot is brilliant and the jokes and words are great, the ideas are great too. I recommend that anyone see this classic. The best part is obviously when they 'melvin' death, I was cracking for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the movie. This is much better than the first, which was also great. Possibly the funniest movie of all time !!!!! I think the best parts of the movie, however, are when Bill and Ted scream well and play the guitar solo, it was hilarious. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, bring a third movie !!
