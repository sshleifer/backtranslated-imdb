Summer was so full of blockbusters and movie returns, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those returns, that I was there to find a movie that I could just sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> In case you do not want to read further down the page (there are no spoilers), I'll summarize here: it is more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but does not try to be overly tacky or to exceed its limits. Think of it as a bit more serious, a little more magical Princess Bride, and you'll be close. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I'm not, perhaps, a movie goer as prodigious as the others ... Maybe once or twice per month if I feel active. I'm also a big fan of science fiction / fantasy. I get tired of retelling repetitive story lines and movies with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this movie is the rough diamond. By the end here (August), I was tired enough of fractured expectations of the great successes that I avoided seeing Bourne Ultimatum in Stardust's favor. Having my hopes confused with Transformers over my addiction to fiction, Stardust's previews seemed appealing, but I was certainly wary. <br /> <br /> Like many others here, I was totally surprised. I'd been thinking about seeing another generic movie clich√© fantasy from here for breakfast. Do not be fooled, it's definitely a fairy tale, and in fact has witches, magic and requires hanging from disbelief ... But the most refreshing thing I've found is that it's NOT based on anything that I am. I've seen it or read it for the past 15 years, and it's really a very good movie. <br /> <br /> (Unlike 90% of other movies that seem to persistently reappear like thorns on one side, maybe a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? <br /> <br /> I could read a book this year, and in two years the film would come out as another "fantasy epic tale, like SdA and the rest," says the NYT and such and such I do not doubt.)) Stardust did not leave me stuck in my seat because of accumulated action on each turn, nor was I sweating bullets because of the plot after the hook of the plot threatening to rip the distant dramatic tension and echo across the theater in a loud boom. He did not even use a huge amount of sound to get my attention for what's happening on the screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). He's not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques, or offend my intelligence with such simple dialogues and story lines that I might have discovered them in 3rd grade (kid, I hate it). <br /> <br /> I just ... watched. I watched, and enjoyed a refreshingly creative plot unfolding before my eyes. Of course, I may have known what would happen for most of the movie, but that makes you forget it. It really did hurt my heart in some parts, but the most important thing I noticed was that I left the theater feeling better than I had when I entered. <br /> <br /> It's really a gem. After so much embarrassment this summer with so many remakes and movies that fell short of my expectations, it was like a cup of cold sweet tea to cap off all the hard work I've done sitting with the others trying to get out of them with my money's worth. <br /> <br /> Probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you like fantasy movies that stand the test of time alone (Promised Princess, Black Cauldron, Black Crystal, etc.) then you should really see this movie. This little diamond is coming to my collection of DVDs by the time it hits stores, you can trust me. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful.
