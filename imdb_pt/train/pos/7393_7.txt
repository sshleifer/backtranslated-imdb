This movie was awesome. My first experience with a foreign film was neither too long nor too complex. I even liked the subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly cool. The story of an adult son visiting his aging father and retarded brother after a long separation seemed clich√© at first, but proved to be very touching and realistic. There was also some subtle humor not to depress or annoy the audience.
