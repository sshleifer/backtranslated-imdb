I bought it a year or so ago for $ 2 (yes, $ 2), I left it on the shelf for a long time, now watching DVDs while I was having a cold. <br /> <br /> This is a haunted movie. Brilliant performances from everyone involved, especially the kid 6yo (about the only smiles you get in this movie). <br /> <br /> The plot reminds me of maybe my favorite movie of all, but obviously this is carefree, that's a heavy heart. As a psychologist, clinical and forensic psychologist, a chill ran through my spine as the identity of the new contract was revealed. Scary stuff! Brilliant work all round. <br /> Pete
