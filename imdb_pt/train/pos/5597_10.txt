"Le Locataire" ("The Tenant") is undoubtedly one of the most important horror films of all time. Polanski plays Trelkovsky, a timid archivist living in Paris, who responds to an advertisement for an apartment, only to find that the previous tenant tried suicide by jumping out of the apartment window. Trelkovsky is forced to visit her in the hospital and there he knows Stella (Isabelle Adjani) .Trelkovsky immediately changes when the previous tenant dies and, at the beginning, is quite satisfied to have Happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia, as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbors, who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky to repeat the previous tenant's suicide. This movie is great. Pansanski manages to create a surrealism atmosphere of dread and paranoia. Many brilliant moments like the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the tooth of the previous tenant in a hole in the wall, or the feverish dream where he enters the building's bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphs.The photograph by Sven Nykvi st is truly beautiful. "The Tenant" is a neglected gem. It may be hard to track, but it is more than worth the effort.
