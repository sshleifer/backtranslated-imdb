Manhattan apartment dwellers need to endure all sorts of inconveniences. The worst thing is the lack of closet space! Some people who eat all the time use their stoves and dishwashers as storage places because the cabinets are already full! Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great team of comedy writers of that era, saw the potential Eric Hodgins's novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, does not support the tight apartment where he and his wife Muriel , and two daughters, must share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, a Madison Avenue. executive, had it! When he sees an ad for Connecticut living, he decides to take a look. Obviously, Jim, a first time owner, is tricked by the real estate man to buy the dilapidated home that he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent. This is just the beginning of your problems. <br /> <br /> What could be wrong, goes wrong. The architect is invited to submit a plan that does not work for the new house after the original is demolished. As one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and whatever the original cost, it ends up at an inflated price that Jim could not afford. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun because of the three principles in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and made the most of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who has always been effective in working with Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, a former boyfriend of Myrna, became a lawyer for the Blandings, is smooth and elegant, as Melvin Douglas portrayed him. One of Blandings' girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who bears a striking resemblance to Eva Marie Saint. The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but does not have much to do. <br /> <br /> The film is affectionately photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make the film look so much better. The direction of H.C. Potter is light and managed this movie that will delight fans of classic comedies.
