It's not a very bad movie, with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best, we could be with Charlie Chan, Moto, Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or Saint etc. In other words, you have the chance to spend another hour with some old friends, from simple to urban, murderers and murderers - always a pleasure in my book. Barrie is a tough lady to take revenge and cleanse her framed and dead father, a police detective, planning and performing with her circle a series of underworld murders. Which certainly would have had the opposite effect! Sanders joins the fun simply by dancing in the right club, in the right place, in the right city, at the right time, with the right lighting falling on him and the first killer (just in time!) And killing him. The story and acting are fine, the only complaint I have is near the end with the hasty and almost risible discovery of who was the evil genius (Waldeman) - they almost forgot their relevance in the plot ? That said, a solid entry into the series.
