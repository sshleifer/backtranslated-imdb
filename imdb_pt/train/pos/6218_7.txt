79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have never done anything but great movies together. Although this is not one of the best, it is an excellent musical. There are some excellent musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball, make memorable presentations at the movies. The ball is particularly good and the blonde too. The "Let's face music and dance" is one of the best numbers of the musical duo of all time. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson, of "Ozzie and Harriet", is the sister of Ginger Roger. The basic plot is quite familiar, but with such an exceptional cast, it works. Excellent art direction and punctuation.
