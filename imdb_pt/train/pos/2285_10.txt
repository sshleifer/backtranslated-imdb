I have not read this book, but throughout the entire film I was impressed with just one thought in mind: this is so Vonnegut. I have never seen an author, all the intelligence and the life behind the workings of a novel, translated so well for the movies. This film had the same complexities found in Vonnegut's novels: jokes were often significant and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, played perfectly by Nick. Nolte He had all the signs of a "hero" Vonnegut: lack of concern about political boundaries, ironic black humor giving way to dormant inactivity in response to stress, and a reluctance to push his version of reality to those around him. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I was constantly surprised and impressed while watching this movie. It was the same feeling I had when I read "Cat's Cradle," my first Vonnegut novel, as if the most perfectly strange thing that could happen, he thought about it, and he made it real and important. Yes, it has nothing but surplus "White Christmas" albums from the army. So it goes!
