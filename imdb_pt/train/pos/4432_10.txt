I happily admit that I am a sucker for a beautiful movie, and movements and angles sufficiently inventive for the camera may be enough to keep my interest in a rather long film. It's not the size of the Gojoe, despite having some of the most notable cinematography I've seen since the Korean period piece MUSA. However, the Gojoe offers far more than beautiful images (just like the MUSA ... does not mean what contrast) - its second greatest strength is excellent acting and a fascinating story with a very obscure philosophy. I must admit I'm not really sure what the point was trying to do in the end, but it definitely causes some thoughts along the way. Vague but definitely thoughts: p <br /> <br /> One department in which the film could have been better is the action. There is a tremendous amount of sangrias in the film, but the whole action is filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups and often obscured by foreground objects. It creates some very intense and impressive visual effects, but it would have been nice to see some more real moves, something that made it more believable that villains could only go through entire armies devastating all. <br /> <br /> Still, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and beautiful films I've seen for some time. Recommended!
