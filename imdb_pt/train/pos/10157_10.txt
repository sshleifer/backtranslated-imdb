This is a fun look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash (adorned in black, of course), who sings a lot and narrates a bit too. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is a lot of fun. Also note the blonde representation of Jesus in this work ... just for fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blonde hair ...? Anyway, it's a fun presentation of the biggest and most important story of all.
