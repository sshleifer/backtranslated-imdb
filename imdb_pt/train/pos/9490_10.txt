First time I saw this movie was in the eighties, but revised now this thriller is still real. Some newer films focus on similar topics, but do not correspond to this French landmark. <br /> <br /> A president - obviously JF Kennedy - is shot in an open car during a public appearance. The resulting huge investigation blames the "Lee Harvey Oswald" figure on this film, but a jury member insists on further investigations. He reveals some surprising evidence ... <br /> <br /> Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK - a movie with the same plot - this does not play with emotions, but focuses on an exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits, drawing a new image of the murder. Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK, this movie is more reasonable, intelligent and exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in many more recent films, I had a kind of déjà vu sometimes sitting in the movies. <br /> <br /> "I ... I'm called" is a "must see." It is unique and brilliant, and the music of Ennio Morricone is wonderful. This movie deserves a very good ranking, if it were a Hollywood production, it would be famous for sure. <br /> <br />
