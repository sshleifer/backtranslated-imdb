This movie was incredible. I would recommend it to anyone, much better than what I had anticipated. It was definitely a spectacular, breathtaking movie. It's an incredible story, with incredible actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (should not surprise anyone) Derek Luke did a wonderful job too.
