This film is somewhat unusual in that it has a very thin plot and the film itself is done in a slow and slow pace. While this makes it quite different from the average Grant movie, it is still highly watchable and entertaining. It's as if someone has said "let's just follow Cary and see how he gets disturbed by all the little problems that arise when you're having a rehabbed house." Considering he's a fun actor in the movie and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the movie works very well. While the film has very modest pretensions, make the most of the material. It's a great movie for Cary Grant fans or the whole family.
