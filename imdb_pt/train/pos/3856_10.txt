"De vierde man" (The Fourth Man, 1984) is considered one of the best European thrillers of the eighties. This latest work by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his native country before moving to Hollywood to become a big star with films like "Total Recall", "Wild Instinct" and "Star Troops" is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (Jeroen Krabbe) by going to the seashore to recover. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and begins a fatal love affair with her. He becomes addicted to her heart and soul and discovers that his three previous husbands all died in mysterious circumstances ... "De vierde man" is heavily influenced by the old Hollywood noire movie and the psychopath thrillers by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells. It takes a lot of time to create a gloomy and exciting atmosphere, and some moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to take the story forward. The suspense is sometimes almost unbearable and sometimes reminiscent of the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento. The cast is also excellent, especially Krabbe's performance as a mentally disturbed writer who opened the door to his international film career ("The Living Daylights"). If you have the opportunity to watch this brilliant psychological thriller on TV, video or DVD, do not miss out!
