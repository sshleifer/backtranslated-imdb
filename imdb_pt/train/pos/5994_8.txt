I had the pleasure of watching Ryan Jafri's short film "The Cure". What really impresses me is camera work and music. <br /> <br /> I think many young filmmakers (as I am myself) would experience difficulties with cinematography when they started producing an indie. We see that the output is not exactly what we imagine or below our ambitions. But this movie, which debuts in the direction of a young director, handled the screen very well. The movement of the camera, color, lighting and composition contribute to the story and the emotion of the film. <br /> <br /> And music, as a key element of cinematic language, helps a lot too. <br /> <It's hard to picture a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a short time. But still, I have to admit that I'm not a fan of narration, especially when the film is advanced by narration rather than shots and cuts. My personal feeling for part of the narrative is, my guess was that the narrator tried a little too much. Thus, energy drives the audience away from the film's excitement. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a short film well done, I could see the opinion of a director. All right, Ryan! Greeting from China, looking forward to your next. tim
