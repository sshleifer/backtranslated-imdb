I just saw the first record in a 4-disc collection (26 episodes) created in conjunction with UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (beyond the first episode), the picture quality is very good. The DVD box is shown on the title page here on IMDb. "Mr. Peepers" is as charming as when I first saw her (5 years old at the time) and Wally Cox is truly captivating in this role. If you're in the mood for a low-key comedy that runs away from you, instead of tapping your head, you value this chance to try out all the wonderful characters you can remember from your childhood. While some of the jokes are a bit corny, most are ingenious and well executed ... and even the most tacky are fun. This is a TV series that lives up to my early childhood memories.
