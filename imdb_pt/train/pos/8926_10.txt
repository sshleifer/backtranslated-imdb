I do not think anyone other than Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung make cinema at a level more pure than Claire Denis. That said, I do not love this latest movie as much as his 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (although it comes close), which in itself is one of my absolute favorite films. It's just because the narrative here is possibly slightly elliptical for its own good. Do not get me wrong, the fact that this movie almost does not have a plot is really one of the best things about it, but I think Denis took more or less one degree more than necessary and hence the film flirts with incomprehensibility , and some key points in the story should have been clarified in some way (so the main character goes to South Korea to do his heart transplant instead of just showing it suddenly without any explanation of where he is or why is it there). Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use actors that she likes once more (Beatrice Dalle's character in particular is a little distracted because you keep hoping it has some meaning). Still, the film is incredibly absorbing and cinematography is incredible. It's definitely a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denis' most acclaimed "Beau Travail", if not better. Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director right now, better than Leos Carax herself. I also have to admit that the South Korean sequel really does "Lost in Translation" better than the movie itself (and I, unlike some, am a big fan of that movie as well).
