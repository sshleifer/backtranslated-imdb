Well, it's definitely different from anything else run by Lynch. No supernatural thing, no violence, no swearing. However, it's a beautiful movie. It's a bit slow, but maybe this was intentional, because it's the story of the 6-week journey of an old man (which is my best guess for its duration). The characters are ordinary people and therefore believable. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Everyone who has a brother can relate to it. Lyle and Alvin do not even have to say anything. For a moment they are back to the old days and the whole fight is forgotten.
