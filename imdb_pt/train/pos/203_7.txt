Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys, starring Walter Matthau and George Burns, is a funny comedy about the strange connection to life and its lack, but the always bitter laughter. Seeing Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns), two great actors in theatrical comedy now reduced to the stubbornness of difficult and incessant old age, you can only feel anger and sadness. Willy does not always give up and continue to look for work, while Al is tired for the players and he is retired to the country at home for his daughter. The couple in their old time were really funny and harmonious, but out of the scene there was a continuous dispute and fights, and for eleven years after their breakup they did not talk. Now, if they could work, they should come back together again to make one of their best old sketches for a comic-book TV show. The meeting is explosive and liberating for the old issues. The screenplay by Neil Simon gives a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and the blue dominate the many games and laughter achieved to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple Walter Matthu (Academy Award for Nomination as Best Actor) and George Burns (Won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor). The two actors are very believable and real, and their harmony seems almost as if they worked together for all this time, and that they do not support reality between them. The film is very touching also by all its consuming reality as the story is told and how the Love-Heat report that links the two actors is a totally real part for the strange but at the same time ordinarily understandable things for life. My rate is 7.
