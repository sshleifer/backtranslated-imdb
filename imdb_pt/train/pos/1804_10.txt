First things first, I have never once been scared of this underrated gem as a child ("Little Mermaid", on the other hand ...). As my title says, this was one of my favorite children's films that I still love as a teenager. It is a beautiful, bittersweet movie about a misfit German shepherd named Charlie (fantastically voiced by Burt Reynolds) who is killed by his boss / partner in crime (it's the name ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent straight to heaven by default because "all dogs go to heaven because, unlike people, dogs are naturally good, loyal and kind." Chalie is sent back to Earth because he has wiped out his life watch, where he gets even worse off with his best friend, Itchy and a little orphan, Anne-Marie. I used to watch it all the time as a child and sometimes I still watch. Anyway, it's a pretty bittersweet movie like I said before it can leave a tear in your eye ...
