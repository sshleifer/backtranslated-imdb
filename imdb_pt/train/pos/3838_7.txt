THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Holland, 1983). <br /> <br /> A film based on a novel by Gerard Reve, which works best as a suspense. This is quite surprising considering that Reve almost needs a hundred pages for just a little twist in the story and the tension is the last thing on my mind while reading your work. <br /> <br /> "The Fourth Man" is very heavy in symbolism. . Paul Verhoeven is usually extremely concerned about proving something to mainly hostile critics and I'm never sure what exactly he's trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such a subtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or plot, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In "The Fourth Man" he is not as explicit in detailing the plot as in sex and nudity (of which there is much), but, as in most of his films, he seems to be afraid that the audience will not catch him and hammer the story with obvious symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and explicit sex scenes. There is hardly a scene without sex or frontal nudity, most of it so maddening and gratuitous in its face, that harms a good story. <br /> <br /> However, when you can deal with Verhoeven's obvious satirical approach, it is a very entertaining thriller sometimes with some intriguing twists and good performances at all times, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbe in particular. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
