In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a gift shop; there she fights with co-worker James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). The two do not get along at work, because each fell in love with an invisible friend. Watching Ernst Lubitsch target these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying. Even better is a sub-plot involving store owner Frank Morgan (as Hugo Matuschek), who suspects that his wife is having an affair. Hiring a private detective, Mr. Morgan confirms that his 22-year-old wife is having sex with one of her younger employees. Morgan, painfully realizing, "She just did not want to grow old with me," and supporting characters are what keep this movie from aging. <br /> <br /> ********* Shop around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
