And that's how the biggest TV comedy started! It has been 12 years since the first episode, but it has continued in the same spirit until last season. Because that's where "Friends" is based: on the quotes. We are going to thank Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe !!! In our first meeting, we see how Rachel turns out a guy (in church, like ... (understand), Monica's quest for the "perfect guy" (there's no perfect face, why are all women obsessed with it ?? ), and how her marriage can be ruined when her life partner discovers she's a lesbian, until we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next few episodes ... ENJOY FRIENDS!
