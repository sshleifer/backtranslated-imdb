This is a racist movie, but worthy of study and pleasure. For the first time, the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe and Daddy. They have a relaxed and peaceful thing, with her still at home about to graduate in high school, and he retired and walked away waiting for inspiration to do something. The second time, you realize how terribly her sister's husband is insulted by his friends in the blues bar of the hinterland. It takes, it's the thing to do these days, and the critical moment passes as if they are talking about the weather. In that same scene, the sister blues music is really a tear if you're a little sensitive and like that kind of music. His performance seems the climax of the story; a blues story with the good guys being "people of color" in their element in the hinterland, SC. Meanwhile, all the white people in the film lead what appears to be a meaningless and superficial life, suitable only for babies. That's cool, as long as you recognize it as fiction.
