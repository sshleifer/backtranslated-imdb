This movie may not put the Catholic church in the best light, but it is telling a story based on real facts. Unfortunately not everything in life, including religion, is pleasant and pink. Sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem to be the right thing, but in retrospect they do not seem as good as before. "A Love Divided" tells the story of a family, yes, it embodies religion, but in fact the story is about a family and the family's ability to stay together, no matter what is played in them. This movie is also based on true events, which is not to say that this story, scene by scene, is true, but if you look at news articles from that time period, you would be able to see that none of the churches dealt with the incident in a way that was helpful to the family. The two churches are guilty here, the Catholic church for forcing such regulation on the family first and not responding to the violence that came with it and the Protestant church by telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and her priest and not put a fight. In this case, both leave this family down. I believe the film does a good job of showing this fight both in church and in the family. It is by no means putting the Catholic church, just the opposite, it shows how an incident can change the course of the ideas of that religion and how a person can have a far more comprehensive effect than just himself.
