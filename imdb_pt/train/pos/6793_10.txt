I absolutely love this game to the death. Since my 9 years of age (I am now 15 years old). It has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and do not forget the incredible shapes of dragons! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel or sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be the hero. In this adventure you find wonderful creatures and boss fights. You also find some friends on the way who have their own special element. Such as Fire, Darkness, Water / Ice, Thunder / Lightning, Earth, Light and Wind. There are also items known as spirits dragons, which allow transformation into magical creatures of legends. Dragons, mages, creatures called winglies and evil creatures that you will have to face in this adventure of emotions full of action and excitement. One of my favorite games of all time, The Legend of Dragoon!
