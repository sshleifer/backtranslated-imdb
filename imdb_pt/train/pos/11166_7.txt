George Raft, like Steve Brodie, the carefree and dancing player who can never refuse a challenge, faces Chuck Connors (Wallace Beery), sentimental and clumsy. A gentle touch to each beggar, Connors impulsively adopts waifs and striders, notably fugitive orphans. "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with kittens!) And the homeless Lucy Calhoun, an innocent from out of town with ambitions to become a writer. <br /> <br /> In this male-dominated culture, communication occurs mainly in the form of violence (one sees why THE BOWERY is a favorite of Martin Scorsese). Exploding cigars provide a running gag. "Swipes" likes to throw stones through windows in Chinatown, on one occasion putting on a flaming clothing. (The simultaneous arrival of the volunteer firefighters from Brodie and Beery leads to a fight, during which the building burns to the ground.) Beery casually punches a troublesome girl, and strikes at anyone who disagrees with him, including Brodie, whom he defeats, a night fight on a moored barge, to regain control of her parlor, lost in a bet that Brodie would not dare jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. (Brodie gives the jump, but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment.) As usual, Walsh fills the frame with details, illustrating with pleasure the fillet's daily life; waiters singing, intimidating bartenders, Suicide Hall prostitutes being pushed into Maria Negra, tailors sticking clumsy cowboys out on the street and forcing them to buy clothes they do not want. A small but admirable film.
