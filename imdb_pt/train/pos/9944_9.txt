Of course, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems that the only "great" movies these days are surprisingly shocking or high budget / hyped somehow. <br /> <br /> The Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to put their hearts in tae kwon do. Regardless of what you expect from this movie, you're guaranteed to be moved by the work, the pain, and the expectations that the characters are forced to experience. Although comical at times, many moments and characters are processed beautifully: there is the old-guard character who takes things very seriously, the bad guy turned good-guy who only wants a second chance at life, the meek team substitute who I would die happy if he just won once in his life, and many other well-rounded characters with their own problems - but more importantly, their own hopes and dreams. While the plot and goals of the film are simple, these aspects of the film only highlight the character's development as they overcome their personal and interpersonal struggles. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie will leave you feeling renewed, determined and satisfied.
