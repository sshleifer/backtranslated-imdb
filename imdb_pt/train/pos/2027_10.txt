What about the irresistible performance of Tara Fitzgerald? She is totally believable as Mrs. Graham's experience hardened, sharp and strong, but not immune to Mr. Markham's passionate attention. Through every malicious glance and every burst of temper, every spark of discernment in his eyes and facial expression, Toby Stephens is a master of his character. He is the force of passion and hope that will restore Helen's wounded spirit. Graves' Huntingdon is a perfect performance of the unreformable rogue. However, despite all that he has done, there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite in the end; he is at least aware of his own faults and how they have caused his ruin. Helen's attempt to save her soul-after leaving him and taking her child to an age where this was unheard of-is a triumph of hope, hope, and faith in the value of all human life and soul, however misguided, however sinful as it may be. person can be. Markham's constancy can then be seen as his reward for his faith and unbending moral character. Although the opinionated ideas of morality put forth so strongly in the Tenant seem to be overtaken by today's standards, history is imbued with integrity, passion, and conviction that still make an impact. The tenant is far more credible than the Howling Wind Hill or even Jane Eyre; Here is an adaptation that does the new justice. I recommend seeing this!
