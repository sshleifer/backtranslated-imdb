This was one of the funniest and biggest sitcom to hit national television. It's unfortunate that the show is not put between big sitcoms where it really belongs. The actors did a great job and the seasons one through six were the show at its highest point. Although the seventh season was not so good when compared to the previous six, it was still funny. The eighth season was the real problem. Without the grace of Topher or Ashton Kutcher, the show simply fell apart. Not much, the other actors were not great if any of the two main characters had left, such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong are also great). same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) also did not help because he was not well received by fans of the show. I believe that if the show ended a year ago, it certainly would have gone down in history as one of the great successes of the sitcom. Season 8 was a little boring, but the end was excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I just hope I wake up one day to find out that the show is back like the '80s show with the same cast, because I'm going to miss the hell out of it.
