I just thought it was great and I still do. I'm grateful that we can still see different things than Hollywood almost floods us. Saving Grace is smart and nice - those who feel offended by the marijuana business prefer to see the kind of American bride movie. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie does not have to be stupid. I was laughing a lot during most of it, but also thinking about what the female character should do to pay off the debts of her late husband. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell - a witty plot with typical English humor. and good acting and direction. You could not ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
