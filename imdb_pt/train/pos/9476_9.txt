For romance, like a married man. The following two movies are recommended. <br /> <br /> 1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to a train station, something can happen. And it happened! How she longed to be there, in a small tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married ... the man was a stranger to the woman who fantasized. <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, groceries and medicines, passing by the ruins of an old wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her husband sick in self-pity and lack of future ... Only when a young euphoric doctor arrived, something happened ... the doctor was a beloved schoolboy fantasizing woman. In both the films of the great directors of the UK and China, passion versus restraint was so intense that in the end, the intimate feelings did not turn into any physical contact. This leaves you with a great taste, smelling it intensely without biting it.
