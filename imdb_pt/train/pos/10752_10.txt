This was the most visually stunning, moving, incredible and incredible story I have ever experienced. Frankly, even these adjectives simply can not describe it. I can not just choose a scene that stood out for me. I suppose if I had to list a few, it would be the fireman's reactions to the sound of the jumping victims; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator, who did not know what was happening, when they finally emerged on the horrible scene; the shock and disbelief of the spectators; and finally the silence. <br /> <br /> On that day, and so far, I remember Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says: "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly screamed with terror and were suddenly silenced." It's amazing how accurate it is in your description. There was truly a disturbance in the Force. <br /> <br /> This documentary vividly reveals this disturbance. The feelings are so incredibly visual. Anger, frustration, shock, fear, exhaustion, and the attainment of its magnitude. It's all there. Nothing is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a powerful and moving documentary that deserves Emmy. Not just because it documents September 11, but because it is simply all it should be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch, be sure to pick up a box of tissues. You will need them. I know I did.
