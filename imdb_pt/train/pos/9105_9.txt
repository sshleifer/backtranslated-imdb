Women never looked as attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's movie, Stones. Although the editor's cut here and there can help the film, it's exciting and enjoyable with an intense brand of the latest Pedro Almodóvar films. 5 different women are dealing with their partners and families. Beginning with several different stories that will gather as the plot continues, Salazar portrays his female characters in the same neurotic and borderline behavior familiar to Almodóvar. A lady of the kleptomaniac high society with a chubby shoe, a burlesque lady caring for her disabled daughter, a drug-addicted dancer obsessed by her ex-boyfriend, and a taxi driver looking after the troubled children of her late husband, all wandering the streets of Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of Almodóvar's well-known actresses, the director gets his first film to give depth to all the characters who share the film, and to create genuine sympathy with each of them. Women control the plot, and men are bound to stay with each other, eventually ... Surprisingly good for a first movie, and worth the time in any standard. It is noticeable that Salazar hesitated in some necessary guidelines for the actresses, but an impressive act is shown anyway on the screen, especially by Monica Cervera, who played in her former short film. <br /> <br /> A must for all fans of Almodovar, and enjoyable to all.
