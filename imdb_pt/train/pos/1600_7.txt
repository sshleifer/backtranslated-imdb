This is not a bad movie. It's not very funny, but it's interesting and fun. There are some funny moments. Cher gives a good performance in a role that is very opposite to your real-life self. Only your performance <br /> is worth it. If this movie had been released today, it would not have been nominated, but by the 1980s standards was excellent.
