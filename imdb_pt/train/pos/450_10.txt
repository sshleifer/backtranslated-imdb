I am inclined to any film that paints a lush image of Italy - in my opinion, the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, uncommonly, for a period, and a little scarce in the cinematographic aspect. However, the great story pays off. The four ladies embark on a much needed relaxing vacation with problems in their minds. Throughout the film, they perceive their problems and begin to correct them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle where they live, has a lovely effect on people. "It's a love tub," says Lottie Wilkins. You can watch their gradual shift from unsatisfied to lush as the Italian coastline works its magic on them. <br /> <br /> All your problems and your solutions are plausible. The actresses were great. The background music seemed very appropriate for a romantic Italian venue. All in all, a 10/10 movie for me.
