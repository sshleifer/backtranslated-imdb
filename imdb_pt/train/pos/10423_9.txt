Yes, Be My Love was Mario Lanza's rocket for fame and still popular today. His voice was strong and firm, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was Caruso's reincarnation. After reading the book by Kostelanitz, who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that constant practice and vocal lessons have become the visionary Caruso to Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did an excellent job in history, but the story is not entirely true; Blame it on Hollywood! I used to practice singing her songs years ago, and I became very good until I lost my voice over emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Reaching the high note of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
