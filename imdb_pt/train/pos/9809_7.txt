Randolph Scott is going to Albuquerque to get a job with his uncle. However, on the way there, the stage is interrupted - although it is not carrying a safe. However, a good girl on board is hiding $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business-and thieves seem to know that. <br /> <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this guy about work. However, he soon discovers that this uncle is an idiot - the typical western villain. You know, the rich guy who just wants to become rich by cheating and robbing and threatening until he owns it all. And it turns out that this idiot was behind the robbery. Scott demands that Uncle returns the money, and then Scott enters into the deal with the nice lady and his brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is NOT the end of the problems - just the beginning. Again and again intrigues of various kinds occur to try to crush the opposition of the uncle. One trick is to bring a beautiful girl to make friends with Scott and his partners. She's a crack and looks bad to Scott - until he finds out why she came to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike most Randolph Scott movies, this one shows Scott as a more stubborn man. Often in his films, he is the last to suggest violence, but in this film he quickly suggests lynching (get the law, let's get caught) and then he's quick to threaten his uncle. What a surprise to see him as a hot head - although in most other ways, he is the same Scott you would expect. <br /> <br /> As far as the film goes, there is nothing particularly unusual about it. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, the villain can not be reasoned and finally is destroyed and Scott receives the girl. Despite this very typical plot, it is all very well treated and as a result is well worth your time. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, there are two strange scenes in the movie. First, at the end of the movie, there's a fight between Scott and Uncle Hugger # 1, Lon Chaney, Jr .. In it, Chaney smokes while fighting - something I've never seen before and admired how he could blow away how he got his kick ass Second, take a load of that wagon scene with the whip - now that was an impossible feat!
