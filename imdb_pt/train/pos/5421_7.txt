"Now in the sunny climate of India, where I used to spend my time as a soldier in the service of His Majesty the Queen ...", so says the famous poem written by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal basis upon which the film "Gunga Din" is based. If you are lucky enough to watch this legendary classic, you will like movies the way they use to make them; for pure pleasure. From the script of the established novelist and poet, this is a story of a humble Indian native named Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who works as a "regimental animal" during the British occupation of India during the 18th century. His greatest desire is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of a British Calvary contingent threatened with death by a notorious Kali blood cult called "The Bandit." Three soldiers in particular stand out in this company who are known for their bravery and camaraderie. First is beautiful and elegant, Cary Grant playing Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Next is Victor McLaglen as a courageous sergeant. MacChesney and finally there's the flamboyant Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as a sergeant. Thomas Ballantine. All three and his fellow soldiers are surrounded by a set of mountain chokers led by their fanatical leader named "Guru" (Eduardo Ciannelli). Amidst the chaos of war, there is the brave water boy who hopes to gain a place in the army by throwing a bugle he has found. A solid story for an old black and white movie that needs little fanfare for those who want to enjoy a classic. ****
