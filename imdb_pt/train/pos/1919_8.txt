I have not read the book on which this was based / inspired. Being one of the last roles of John Ritter (RIP), it is expected to be hilarious. And this is it. Almost every time he's in it, actually. Most of the cast, both supportive and regular, plays against each other well, and the material tends to be great. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical guy of that age, Kerry, the half-depressed child who struggles for cause and conscience, and Bridget, the popular mistress and fashion lover. Sagal makes a comeback to the female role in a comedy, and her character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show changed a little after Mr. Three's Company passed away, and for a while, they could not decide whether they wanted to get laughter, or be poignant and sure to be respectful. One can imagine how or why it lasted so long after that: it can still be very good, some of the additions were lucky (if you like David Spade, most of it consists of him doing the part) and have things to say . My personal favorite episode is last season. Humor is a good mix of "dumb" jokes (mostly school-related), nonsense, dark comedy, and raw material. It was about sex and other adult topics, but never graphically. The language is moderate and sometimes moderately strong. I would recommend this to any fan of those who did this. 8/10
