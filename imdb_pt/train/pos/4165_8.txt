No, that hilarious horror of the '70s, made for TV, is not about a demonic dessert cake possessed. Yet this exceptionally dreadful but undeniably entertaining and therefore pleasurable cathode ray scrape reaches a pinnacle of absolute and persistent folly and atrocity that is quite tasty in such an execrable and utterly incredible form. Richard Crenna, seemingly dejected and possibly intoxicated, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if she had never overcome the violent rape she suffered in Jackson County Jail, slowly portray a disgusting and respectable suburban couple whose quaint, boring little town existence is divided when the beautiful German Shepard is seen as the family pet is an ancient and lethal evil spirit. Soon Mimieux and his two repulsively cute kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from Disney's "Witch Mountain" photos) are worshiping a wax chalk drawing of the nasty and ugly canine entity on the lair. Boy, now does not this sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing that laughable claptrap sure is not, but it sure is funny, thanks to Curtis ("Night Tide") irretrievably weak direction of Harrington, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully laughable 'n'ridridous plot , and a game cast that strives valiantly with the absurd story (in addition to the leaders, both Martine Beswicke and RG Armstrong briefly appear as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory has a great turnout as a useful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the blow on Crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand on a blade of lawn mowed wildly. While snobbish and hateful horror movie fans can keep their mouths in the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly stinking bumbling, devout lovers of TV junk should regard this affectionately abominable treat as the equivalent of Alpo.
