This is a children's fantasy film based on the Boggy Creek Legend, although I do not know why they call it Return to Boggy Creek, as if it were a continuation. This film has nothing to do with the documentary and its children's fantasy. Dawn Wells stars as the mother of three children who get lost in the swamp around Boggy Creek with two other men and the monster comes to their aid. Yes, it's very silly and the plot is tacky, but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8 to 12-year-old group he targeted. It's harmless childrens fare and at least you do not have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch. Strictly for the age group 8-12, older children will be bored and will think it is a failure.
