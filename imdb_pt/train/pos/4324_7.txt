You do not need to read this comment. <br /> <br /> An earlier review by Seattle's pninson has identified all the major shortcomings of this production. I can only broaden your basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively recent novel by Dickens and is much darker than his previous work. This is taken literally by the director, Ross Devenish, who greatly increases the darkness and the fog. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear, half an hour after the opening episode, it is a relief to be in daylight for the first time. In some of the more obscure scenes, it was hard to see what was really on my TV screen. I watched the whole thing in one day, starting in the middle of the afternoon. As daylight has disappeared, this has become a minor problem, but I have a good TV and have never encountered this problem before at any time of the day. <br /> <br /> The pace is very deliberate (that is, slow). I'm sure that was intensional, but it's an exaggeration. There are countless shots of people crawling through the grime and gloom of Victorian London that are held for longer than necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere. A good editor could probably take several minutes out of each fifty-minute episode without losing a line of dialogue, just trimming each of those scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not want to exaggerate these two problems. . You soon adjust to the look and pace of this production. The most important issue is that you do not always tell the story very effectively. Dickens' oldest novels are as long as the Bleak House, but they are not so intricately designed. For example, I recently re-read Nicholas Nickleby because I was intrigued to see how Douglas McGrath put an 800-page book into his two-hour film. The answer is simple: the book is full of fill. McGrath has cut large strands of the novel, retaining all the essentials of the story. That would not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production needs seven hours. He probably needs even more, because many elements of his complicated plot are not clear enough, or as well manipulated as they should be. Some random examples will illustrate the problems. <br /> <br /> The maid, Rose, appears out of nowhere without background, so Lady Dedlock's connection with her is largely unmotivated. <br /> <br /> Sergeant George's acquiescence in Tulkinhorn's demand for a sample of Horton's handwriting is somewhat fake. <br /> <br /> It is not clear enough that Esther is really in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce. Nor is it clear that they agreed not to announce the engagement or why. <br /> <br /> The secret marriage of Ada and Rick is omitted. In one episode they are just lovers, the next, people suddenly refer to them as husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Rouncewell is only introduced at a late stage of history and the removal of Sargeant George from his family. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn's dedication to maintaining the honor and respectability of the Dedlock family is underestimated, so his motive for pursuing Lady Dedlock is more obscure than necessary. The involvement of the brick makers with Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is a bit opaque. <br /> <br /> It is not obvious that Guppy renews his offer to Esther because she scars from the smallpox almost disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is just a selection: there are others. They are not big problems and the main thrust of the story is clear enough. However, small irritations are damaging to your power: you should not have to dwell on small plot points. However, there are more important structural problems that weaken history in its later stages. <br /> <br /> Any business of the Tulkinhorn Murder is somehow thrown away. Bucket immediately points to Hortense as a suspect, which detracts from the suspense of Sergeant George's situation and the importance of finding Mme. Rouncewell. It also lessens the impact of the sub-plot in which she suspects is cast on Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is unmasked in front of Sir Lester. A more serious problem is that the murder, its investigation, and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock dominate the story for over an hour, during which time we have completely lost sight of the other main strand of the plot: the legal case and its effect on Rick. His failed finances, his strokes of Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, his decadent health and so on, are all suspended for a whole episode. That may be how Dickens wrote the book (I have not read it for years), but a good script must keep the different plots moving forward. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of Smallweed in history is so diminished. that it is almost superfluous. His discovery of the new will, which unleashes the final phase of the story, is also thrown away. It happens off the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, it is still a very good production. Many of the performances are excellent. Individual scenes are beautifully done. Your accumulated sense of tragedy is very powerful. I would still be recommending it as an excellent adaptation of a great book if it were not for the 2005 production. In fact, I probably would not be fully aware of its shortcomings if I had not seen how Andrew Davies did it better. I have been criticizing Davies 'adaptations in Jane Austen, but I have to admit that he really knows how to tame Dickens' books. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing and thrilling drama that is worth seven hours of anyone's time. Nevertheless, its probable destiny should be seen mainly as a cross reference to the almost definitive version of 2005.
