Maybe the film itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone will agree with me that the fight at the mall was one of the best fight scenes ever made. There were also some memorable maneuvers that were so impressive that made this film a classic action. This movie has influenced many other action films and I think action filmmakers should learn from this film nowadays (how they could redo that chase scene, I think with modern technologies they could make it even better). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie enjoyable, even when Jackie was not fighting. I think they could put more fighting scenes in this movie.
