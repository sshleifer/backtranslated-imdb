The original animated Dark Knight returns in this adventure film that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its coolness. There's a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> There is a new crime fighter on the streets of Gotham. She dresses like a bat, but she's not an adult Batgirl. And Batman is denying any affiliation with her. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to deal with the novels and detective work of all time. But Penguin, Bain and the local crowd make things a bit more complicated. <br /> <br /> I did not have high hopes for this' un, 'as I was very disappointed, but the weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin isn' t such a thing here!), but I was blown away by the imaginative and exciting, clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor. This is definitely a movie that no Batman fan should have. Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called "Betcha Neva", which is featured prominently all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD is not so good. Do not get me wrong, there are some great features (the short 'Chase Me' is amazing) and a really cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, but ... the movie is featured on Pan and Scan. Batman: The Batwoman's Mystery was designed and filmed at 1.85: 1, but this DVD is presented at 1.33: 1 in comparison to the widescreen clips shown in the features there is IS image cut on both sides. I find this extremely annoying considering that the Mask of Phantasm was presented in an anamorphic widescreen. Warner had to re-cast literally dozens of DVD movies because people complained about the lack of original Aspect Ratio available in some titles. Why they chose to make the same mistake here again is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I would give this 5/5 DVD, but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 4/5. It's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great DVD package.
