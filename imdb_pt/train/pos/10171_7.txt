Once when I was in college and we had an international fair, the Russian section had a Soviet-era poster saying "Ne boltay!", Which means "Do not gossip!". I "translated" into the "generation" of TV assistants like "Do not be Gladys Kravitz!" (in reference to the nosy neighbor in "Bewitched"). <br /> <br /> However, when you see the result of gossip in Pvt. Snafu short "rumors", you see that is not a very laughable subject. In this case, the perpetually stupid soldier overhears something about the bombing and immediately assumes that the Axis Powers attacked the United States. So he tells someone, tells someone, tells someone and goes on. As in "The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming," the story becomes increasingly disproportionate at a time, so that when you return to Snafu ... well, you know what I mean! Yes, it's mostly World War II propaganda - complete with a pejorative term for the Japanese - but I have to say that the Pvt. Shorts snafu were actually very funny. Of course, since they had written Dr. Seuss and Mel Blanc providing the voices, it's no surprise that they came out pretty cool. Worth seeing.
