I saw this movie on television and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a cool movie and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and, of course, Mccomb. At that time I was thrilled watching this movie and since then I'm trying for the VCD of this movie but I can not find it. Large African lions make appearances in their film and we will be bewitched simply by the size of these animals and their grace. The entire section of the audience can watch this movie, particularly the children will like this movie. But some scenes involving Mccomb force the orientation of the parents to this film. It's a nice holiday movie for everyone.
