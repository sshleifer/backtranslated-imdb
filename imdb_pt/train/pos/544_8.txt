I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first one (cottage by the lake), but instead of killing women, it also kills men. And the scenes are a lot more interesting, two of my favorite scenes are first, when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and he is describing the last moments of Kimberly before being thrown in the water, and secondly, when Stanley is visiting Allison in her basement, before they go to the set, when she kisses him. These scenes, to me, were very intense and fascinating. I gave the film an 8/10 note, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, I mean there were times when you noticed that nothing was wrong, as if it were filmed as a movie is usually shot , you would not see the "live" camera footage but, very little, you would notice the filming mistakes. What went wrong?
