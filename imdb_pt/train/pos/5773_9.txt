Since I'm so interested in lake monsters I actually dug this movie. This movie is worth seeing. If you like the horrible they are good types of movies check it out. The effects are really good, just think of "Land of the Lost". I watched this movie originally in the early 90's, maybe more like 89/90 in a local channel monsters program called "Morgus Presents". I was not scared but I was 8 years old and anything B looked like an A. Years later I saw on DVD at a local Circuit City and bought immediately to give 9 because there's a personal place in my heart right there with The Monster Squad and Gremlins . Good movie B fun for all ages.
