TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: Over the years the public has seen and understood war movies with all points of view. See possible, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying several soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM"), easily one of the most risky directors currently working, found resemblance to "The Thin Red Line" in the way his new drama "Tigerland" takes the place of an individual soldier. This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Saving Private Ryan." Although the dramatic impact of the film is somewhat diminished due to the perversity of the present material, it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young people training for war. <br /> <br /> I would like to know the experiences of Joel Schumacher with the army. Are men really so bold and brutal? I'm sure some of them are, but the film sees its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who is rebellious against war ideas. His personality instantly neutralizes with several other characters, one who becomes his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis), and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose inflamed temperament often exacerbates Bozz's tension with the idea of ​​going to war. The war portrayed in this production is not found on a battlefield, but in training camps of a Louisiana-based training camp between conceptions and fears of soldiers in training. This film is specifically about preparing for war, nothing less. It ends when the soldiers finally go to war, somewhat disappointing, since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a reward. <br /> <br /> Filmed in 28 days using a 16mm stock and a tiny budget, Joel Schumacher accurately displays a gritty, perverse, cruel and ruthless atmosphere using portable cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy, faded images make the film look like a documentary. This unusual style of footage only adds to the hard core realism of the film, rather graphic in its use of coarse language, perhaps a little too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words strike the audience, some in shock at what they are hearing. Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not prevent dialogue from prevailing as devastating, true and emotional. <br /> <br /> If there is anything, "Tigerland" gives us a little appreciation of how much our soldiers pass through our lives. country in the early stages of combat. Such bravery must lead to enlisting in the army during wartime, knowing the difficulties and risks that are being taken. These thought-provoking insights are made possible by the heart-piercing performances of young aspiring actors portraying the various trainees. This movie is not for all audiences, but the boys should take a look before they enlist in the army ... and the adult audience must watch to appreciate the courage to do so. <br /> <br />
