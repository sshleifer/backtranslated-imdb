I thought this movie did a good job. It was not as creative or original as the first, but who he hoped it was. It was very funny. the more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it comes out on DVD I'll pay the money for it with great pride, every penny. Sharon Stone is great, she always is, even if her movie is horrible (Catwoman), but this movie is not, this is one of those films that will be underestimated for your life, and will probably become a classic in 20 years Do not expect be a classic, watch now and enjoy. Do not expect a masterpiece, or something that is exciting and touching, just allow yourself to get out of your life and get involved with theirs. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is fun and I recommend people who have not yet seen, because what the critics say and the box office do not always count, see for yourself, you never know, you can simply enjoy . I take my hat off for this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
