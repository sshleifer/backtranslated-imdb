One of the best comedy series ever to come out of Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are great actors and artists who seem to be at home with drama and comedy. Enough supported by his writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they populated the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. Britain pales in insignificance as a poor imitation of its ideas. Consistently original and groundbreaking, I'm sure so many people hate these series as loving them, but I'm just as sure no one could have any opinion on the LOG. I have not yet seen the feature film, but I have heard good things and bad things, so I will reserve judgment. I do not know if the TV series came to the US, but I would be fascinated to see how the American public found the envy of humor.
