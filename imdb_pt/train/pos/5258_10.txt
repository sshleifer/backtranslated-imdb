The Ladies Man is a funny laugh, with a great diverse cast, as well as some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). <br /> <br /> Ferrell is your usual quality self in a brilliant side role. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and wrote some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth a purchase as watching every 6 months or more will lead to you still laughing as much as you did the first time. <br /> <br /> I am disturbed to think, by the time I write this, that it has a scant 4.7 / 10 and I ask you to vote! <br /> <br /> And remember children - "There is more movement in the ocean"
