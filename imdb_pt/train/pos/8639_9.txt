I have to start apologizing because I found that the first 75-80% of this movie was hilarious. It's mainly because of Brad Pitt's performance. Spot on. <br /> <br /> The acting of everyone involved was very good, but Brad stole the film. The atmosphere was perfect in every way. I'm not a giant fan of Pitt, but this has to be one of his best roles ever. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I was reading a previous review and the person said that the rationale behind Early's violence is not explained. It is explained, but fortunately, they do not have to go into graphic detail to understand better. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave a 9 because each scene bar 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor in the first half is perfect for this movie. Underestimated
