"And all over the house" is a special episode of the crypt not only because it's the first season, but this episode was the first I saw! I remember as a young man on vacation with my parents that summer of 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO. I saw this episode and was buried in the Crypt at that moment and forever! I've always been a fan of horror thriller series and I enjoyed monster movies, and with this series started by HBO I again had a terrible pleasure. This episode being the first I've seen is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's so nice with a cool twist. "And all around the house" has a nice and cozy setting on a snowy Christmas eve, which is a perfect way for you to relax for holiday poo! Well, anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who plays a number of warner brothers, usually small parties) as a greedy, greedy woman who looks after her husband while waiting for some money and a new romance. Just like most horror series, things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. Chances are very great when a maniac dressed in Santa Claus escapes from a local nut house, making a late holiday slicing on Christmas Eve! From the old comics lessons of the US, you learn that bad people get what they want! Well, this tale ends with a perfect holiday cry! Also this tale was in the 1972 film and featured Joan Collins, this is undoubtedly one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all time!
