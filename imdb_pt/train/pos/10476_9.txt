My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album of the same name, which I bought around 1993. I was reading the notes and the band said that the album, which remains in a prominent place in my collection, was inspired by Canada. author of the book by Paul Quarrington. <br /> <br /> I took the book a few months later and devoured it! An incredible read! Since then, I've read the book countless times, always finding a new element for Desmond and his desire to complete Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996 on video. I have not had many good experiences with Canadian films, but this has worked for me. Claire's role might have been different, but overall I think Paul Quarrington's vision was transferred from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> Maury Chaykin makes a poignant performance as an isolated genius. The movie deals with family relationships, love and find someone who understands. I would strongly recommend "Whale Music" not just for music fans, but for anyone who has already lost something or for someone else, and tried to find their way around the world.
