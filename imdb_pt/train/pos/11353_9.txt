This movie was excellent. It details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia during the 1980s. I give this film high marks for its staring at the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated community (thanks to the " Scheme "). This is a graphic film. It presents an un sensitized image of violence and its tragic remains. Nothing is "clothed with candy" with exaggerated blood or blood to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This film is based on Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I'm familiar enough with the actual story to have a very thorough appreciation of how real they have kept the movie. It's not a comedy, but for those who enjoy dry and gloomy humor, this movie is a must-see.
