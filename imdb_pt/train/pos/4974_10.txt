This was a lovely presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well interpreted by animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbery superiority and innocent wonder. The citation (or scene) I remember vividly is when Hemo gets tired of "all that plumbing ... you still have not learned my secrets" and threatens to erupt, the scientist answers in a single word "Thalassa" - salty water that horrifies the writer of fiction, but appeases Hemo and follows so precisely the chemical aspects of blood. <br /> <br /> Such a splendid mix of entertainment and information makes this a classic as fresh and captivating today as it was the day it was released. Stimulating interest and imagination is key to teaching children to love learning.
