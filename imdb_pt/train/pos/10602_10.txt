I have to say that I totally loved the movie. There were funny moments, some comforting parts, all right. I personally enjoyed the movie because it is something that I can finally relate to my childhood. This movie, in my opinion, is geared more towards the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy would be treated as he grew up. All the insults, swearing, and not knowing is something I, like most other young boys, will always remember, and now finally a movie that illustrates how difficult it is to grow up gay. So I definitely recommend watching this movie. Probably should not really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand
