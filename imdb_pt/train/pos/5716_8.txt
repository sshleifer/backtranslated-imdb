I did not see any of the Grudge Japanese movies, but I really like this movie. I'm rarely scared when I watch movies. I can jump, if the effect and sound are surprising enough, but being scared of a movie is a rare thing for me. But I was afraid of Grudge. Maybe because I did not expect anything when I watched. I did not expect to be scared. I did not know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you apparently love or hate. Most people seem to compare it to Grudge's Japanese films, but even if I have not seen them, I do not think it's right to compare any movie, actually. This is his movie. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree. The story is minimalist and purposeful. The techniques of storytelling used - the interrupted period of time, for example - are done to perfection. The director knows exactly what he's doing, and I believe he got his vision as he wanted it. <br /> <br /> I gave this 8 out of 10 movie. It's a movie that you will enjoy watching, or hating. It's that simple.
