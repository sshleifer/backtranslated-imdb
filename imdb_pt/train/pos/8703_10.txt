I got into this movie after having read that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift who was turned into a monster by society. Suffice it to say that I was expecting something totally different from what I received. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I thought the film was very romantic (the fact that the male protagonist is not bad to see for sure helped), and there was enough plot development, action and even humor 3) part of the movie now the name of the other had the whole theatrical movement laughing) to keep you entertained and invested in the story. So in short: not what I expected, but a very good surprise, in fact. I'm definitely going to buy this movie when it's released on DVD.
