There's something about every "Hammer" movie that I see that really drives me into a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies, anything can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one such type of film. He ventures deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring a different kind of horror fantasy. All in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10.
