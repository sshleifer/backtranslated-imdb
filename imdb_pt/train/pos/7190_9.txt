Best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite serials, period. This is a period series set soon after the birth of Mexico. The new nation is counting on the gold produced by this city to keep the republic solvent. However, a gold god, Don del Oro is stirring the Indians and stealing the gold for himself. His fox and his pack of men to the rescue. Reed Hadley is a winning Zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he enters a good selection of scraps (most of which were reused by the Zorro series later as well as other serials as well). The story moves and is not very clear . who is the real thug. There's a reason I've seen this more than any series I've seen, it's simply a great action adventure movie. The only thing I can compare is the Mark of Zorro with Tyrone Power or one of the other fanatics of the period. It is super and highly recommended.
