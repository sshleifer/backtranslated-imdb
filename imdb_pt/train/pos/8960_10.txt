this may not be War & Peace, but the two Academy names would not have been screened were it not for the genius of James Wong Howe ... this is one of the few movies I fell in love with as a kid and came back without dissatisfaction. If you have any interest in what you offer in a fictional or otherwise, BB & C is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's his best job, I'm no expert at it, for sure. but the look of this movie is incredible. I love everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, the cat, the crazy crazy, the retro-low; but the way it was put in the film is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above, and the "special effects" that seem late now. All of this creates a truly consistent world.
