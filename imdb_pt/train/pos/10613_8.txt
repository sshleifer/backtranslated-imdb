This is a long lost gem of horror, starring Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it's hard to locate a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This movie is scary, but tacky at the same time. It seems that three young women (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California, to cover a festival when a mess surrounds their hotel room and they seek refuge at Earnest Keller's (Lassick) house. and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feeling bad, while the other 2 will film their story. She is soon murdered at home, in a very tacky way by some unknown force hidden in the ventilation system (she is decapitated by the closing cap of the vent as it collapses on it as it is being pulled into the basement). ). Soon Karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal manner by having her face pounding on the vent cap. Jennifer is struggling with her (ex?) Lover in a rather annoying conspiracy and when she returns home, her hosts (which we now discover are brother and sister and whatever is in the basement is their son) a plan to try to kill her too. Virgina does not fully agree with Earnest's plan to murder Jennifer, but she is taken to the basement where she meets Junior. Here the film becomes almost comical, since Junior (portrayed hysterically by Stephen Furst) is a deformed, mentally deficient man, whose actions and movements cause some laughter, even if this is scary. This is where the rhythm of the film begins and the ending is well done. The actors do a great job with the material, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made, it's a lot of fun!
