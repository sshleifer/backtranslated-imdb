I really liked this movie. The acting was great, just like the plot. Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized. The only part of this movie that I would change was the ending. The creature's death was too horrible for the Sci Fi Channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this movie. Jeff Combs obviously played a figure of the Messiah and the creature (or shark, if you prefer) represented the anti-Chirst. There were some particularly scary scenes that had that "end of the world". I only noticed this after my third showing of this classic creature feature. I know that many people will not get references to Christianity, but if you look closely, you will understand.
