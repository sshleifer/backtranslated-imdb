I really enjoyed this movie. (That's why I was surprised to have such a low rating on so many users on this site!) I'm not saying it's a cinematic masterpiece, but it was a great way to spend a cold snowy night on Saturday. It's funny, poignant and a great tale of the ups and downs of women's friendships that linger on hard times and the bad things that friends tend to do to each other! Bill Paterson shines as Reverend Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove that she can be a good actress when the role is right and she is dedicated to it. (And truly, there's the best "wedding escape" I've ever seen or dreamed of in this movie ... more courage than anyone I've ever met!) You'll laugh and cry --- ignore any marketing campaign and as this movie is being marketed ... it's a hidden gem that should have made TONNES at the box office. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
