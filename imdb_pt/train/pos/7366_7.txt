This is a movie that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it does not give the viewer an easy view. The story about the troublesome Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night movie, but it has a unique advantage and I found it amusing. There are moments of brilliance, since the film was filmed on such a low budget, as when Spike inhales the aerosol. However, I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and, to be honest, I made myself spend most of the film trying to solve it. And also I did not like the fact that most of the movie is spent with the two friends talking and not much "action". It's a small movie that's complex to watch and that's what makes it appealing.
