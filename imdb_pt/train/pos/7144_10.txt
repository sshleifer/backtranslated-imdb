I've seen the movie Holes and say that it has to be the best movie year-round. This brings the child in everyone. I mean, who would have the idea of ​​having troublesome kids digging holes like punishment? Louis Sachar is who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, the cave man / Stanley should be the biggest one there. Wise weight and wise height, but ZigZag / Ricky was taller and Axila / Theodore was bigger. Also X-Ray / Rex should be one of the smaller kids, but it was not. The only thing I did not like about the movie was that the flashbacks were pretty persuasive and long. I'd rather see more of the present than of the past, but that's just my opinion. I especially like boys work. As Squid / Alan, who was played by Jake M. Smith, should be a tough-tempered kid. Jake M. Smith did just that and did a great job, as did almost all the actors at Holes. So I would say if you have not seen Holes then you should definitely see it when you leave again or you'll be missing out on a lot of fun.
