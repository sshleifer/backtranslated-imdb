I lived during those times and I think the show caught the heart of the time. I think I should have handled more of the African American issue, but I think it covers a lot in the program. It was scary to sit and watch the tumult on TV, hoping they would not go to their families and not be burned. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a great job portraying a veterinarian coming back from the war. I went to school with guys who came back. Some have changed more than others and others not so much. It bothers me when someone comments that a problem has not been covered enough or was not fun enough. Live and make comments. I thought the movie was great and that everyone did a remarkable job. Thank you for a trip (sad and good) by the road of memory.
