This movie has it all. Emotion, power, affection, the lovely naked beach of Stephane Rideau ... It exposes the need for true inner communion and external communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple that happens to be gay does not mean that there is not a very useful view for anyone. I would probably rate this as a gay movie, but it can be enjoyed and loved by heterosexual people as well as by homosexual and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to deal with his emotions discloses the way our society does not encourage us to act differently, and this is what engenders the discord between him and Cedric. This is definitely a must see !!!!
