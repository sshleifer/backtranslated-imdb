I've been a fan of Jodie Foster since we were kids, from the Disney years. I loved his antics in films like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> "Foxes" was a major departure from all of this. <br /> <br /> Where other young actors of that era turned to sex. ("Darling," someone?), Jodie went to a depressing, tragic tale of teenagers dragged to death by the powerful lure of temptation and addiction. <br /> <br /> This was not Disney. This was not Porky's. This was not "Halloweed". This was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of young lives. Unfortunately, it's a tale that still happens daily across the country, this movie can be repeated (with a current soundtrack) and still be totally relevant. <br /> <br /> It's not the best film of all time, it's tired in some parts, not all performances are particularly notable. But Jodie Foster continued to show off her skills as a real adult actress (a trend started when she was very young in Taxi Driver). <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Barky
