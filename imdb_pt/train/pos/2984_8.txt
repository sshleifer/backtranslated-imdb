David Zucker directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, it is a matter of acquired taste and depends on a wealth of jokes, but it is consistently fun unlike some recent comic endeavors. The movie is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the obvious obvious to the more subtle type that you should watch for everything on the frame or you will probably miss them. Like his previous efforts, which include "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun", humor flies almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it is easy to ignore the few that fall flat. What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the genre of spoofs is that it has a real plot. While others have depended on making fun of many famous scenes in almost random movies (get "Mafia!", Please), this movie tells a new story with friendly characters. She plays sports films in general as well as satirizes the true sports industry instead of satiriating any particular movie. Even for people who do not care for South Park, its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of important actors with natural chemistry. The film also makes extremely effective use of special appearances from athletes, sports advertisers and other celebrities, especially a little hilarious with Robert Stack from "Unsolved Mysteries." By the way, get the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker achieved, in words, perhaps applying the film's sports mix, one buried at home.
