It was circulating on TV and HBO was showing a double hit of incredibly horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, "Hey this sounds like fun," - I really love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first, I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but it was later explained that, because of his condition, he never went through puberty, so the loud voice and the smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried, I watched a little more, I laughed, got up to get another tissue, and then I cried a little more. When Jonni Kennedy's "time is up," he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he learned the lessons of this life and he was free. I recommend it. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart.
