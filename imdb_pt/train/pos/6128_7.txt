Yes, this is Grade B horror. But at least the producers, directors and cast do not pretend that this movie is manna from the sky. The plot is tacky, a psychotic serial killer on his way to execution is filled with genetic acid, turning him into a snow man. Snowman Jack Frost then goes on a murder attack to find the small town sheriff who finally arrested him. With a limited budget, the staff had to settle for limited special effects, most of the money seems to be spent on the snowman costume. Particular tricky photos are managed by cartoons or distant photos (shots where the camera moves away to disguise the details). <br /> <br /> This is not a children's movie and should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same title. If you do not allow your children to watch pg-13 movies alone, parents should not allow their children to watch this movie. This movie has two claims to fame. 1. Beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made her first major role in the movies. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth is worth watching sometimes. 2. This movie has the worst snowman joke of all time. The joke is so bad that the directors credit the joker counter on the credit list.
