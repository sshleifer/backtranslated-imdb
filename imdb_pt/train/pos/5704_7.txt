To be fair, I expected car chases in this movie. There was only one, but other than that, 'Freeway' was a great movie that I'm happy to have on DVD. The only really important names in the cast are HOMICIDE's Richard Belzer as radio psychiatrist and villain Billy Drago, resembling B-Movie, as the self-reveling killer who quotes the Apocalypse. But the rest of the cast usually gives good performances. I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character, Sunny, a little courage. She could have been a helpless victim character, but she is fully rounded while she seeks out Drago with the help of bounty hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Russian, I'm afraid, looks a bit wooden, but then again, the character he plays, Frank, is not very well prepared except for a story in the past. Sunny is given by his former commander. The threatening tone is maintained superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely Los Angeles freeway at night with the killer prowling his length in his sinister gray sedan is a great way to increase tension, and the music used to underline the film is suitably composed. I do not know why there are some people who hate this movie. Different traits for different people, I suppose. But I absolutely enjoyed 'Freeway' and I highly recommend it.
