This is not a deep movie; most aspects of the plot are quite predictable and "tried and true," but it was well-interpreted and made some interesting points about what we might regret (our "mistakes" as the film calls them) as we look at our lives. I had not read the book so I did not know much besides being the story of a dying woman who has strong memories from a long time ago that she did not share with anyone. Fortunately they got a first-rate cast .... Meryl <br /> <br /> Streep's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays the young Lila, and then Meryl appears at the end of the movie as the old Lila ... beyond of an incredible likeness (duh!) the younger actress did a great job (maybe not so much with her mother's caliber, but who is it?) All the others in this movie were fine, although I wish there were more of Glen Close and I thought Buddy's character was a bit too dramatic. <br /> <br /> This is more of a girl movie than for boys, but a good thing to do with your mother, or your daughter, and maybe start some dialogue. How difficult it is to know a father as a "person"!
