Full House is a great show. I'm still growing on it today. I started watching when I was 8 and now I'm 12 and I still watch. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor. in case there are people in this vision who hardly see the program, you must because you will get addicted to it. I got hooked on it after the first show I saw, which happened to be the first episode in 2002. It's a really good show. I really think this show should go for many generations in families. and it's great too because it's a show suitable for all ages. and for all parents, teaches children lessons about how to get on with their lives. nothing terrible happens, like violence or profanity. it's just a great sitcom. I give 5 of 5 stars. What do you think? OH and the best time to watch is when you're home sick from school or even from the old office. It will make you feel much better. Trust me I'm almost sick at home but I still know this will make you feel better. and for everyone who thinks the show is stupid, well, that's too bad for you because you will not get that far in life, even if you're happy with your life. you really should watch and you're going to get addicted to it. I'm just saying what happened to me and with everyone else who started watching this incredible show. Well, I need to go to lunch. remember you should start watching full house and soon!
