in an unconventional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a child, and I just recently remembered it, and thought about looking for it. Although many of the details are not clearer in my mind, the general feeling that the film has given me has been with me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes then I recommend this movie. He taught me a lot about life and death and brought me a lot of emotion. To this day, it's still one of my favorite movies.
