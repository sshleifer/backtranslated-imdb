In my honest opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. It really put things into perspective while I watched. Although fictional, this movie is about something that could happen to your kids. <br /> <br /> It shows how two children can hide both their hatred for school and their plans to kill innocent students. This movie would not have worked in any other format. They took the handheld, perfectly. <br /> <br /> It reminds us of April 20, 1999, when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves. It also reminds us of the media storm that followed. Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the Basement tapes. <br /> <br /> This film is a fictional version of our dreams come true. We see the child behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it did not go well on the market, and few people know it existed. If it had a preview in a single box office champion film, everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I believe this is the best cinematic adaptation of a school shooting. of the few who actually tried it. The shooting itself takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half movie long because it focuses mainly on Cal and Andre, and what they did up to that point. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, you will rent it and watch it. I guarantee that when you're done, you'll be speechless.
