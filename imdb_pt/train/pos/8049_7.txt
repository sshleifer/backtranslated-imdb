Overall, I would have to say I enjoyed the movie. Some of the fighting scenes are very good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene, you see one of the fighters on the ground is laughing. Otherwise, Sammo perfectly copies Bruce Lee's fighting moves. 5 out of 10 stars.
