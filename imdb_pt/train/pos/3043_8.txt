This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one man industry. This movie will also tell you why Indian movie goers are cunning shoppers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the height of his Bollywood domination when his old godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use his image again. Prakash has a habit of choosing themes and building stories from it, adding liberal doses of sensitivity and clich√©s to it. Zanzeer saw the creation of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about master-servant loyalties. <br /> <br /> But then, the subject was limited to moving the script through the regulation of three hours of music, dance and drama. What makes up the film is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and becomes a regulating hero. Amitabh's vocal ability and diction saw this movie make a lot of money, thanks to his impeccable Haryanvi accent. For me, that's the biggest draw of the movie. The rest is typical of Bollywood writing. <br /> <br /> Amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his films. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The shoe at the party, the monologue on Vijay Merchant and the considerations of Vijay Hazare, The Mosquito Challenge in the Boardroom and the customary drunken scene that has now become a standard Amitabh fare. Shashi Kapoor added an Extra mile to the film with his melancholic, spoiled character (Remember him asking Ranjeet for "Shaaadaaaap" after the poisoned cake incident.) His was the important role of the master , while Amitabh was his loyal servant.But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind ... and so Shashi had to carry on his act with the rest of the film.He was a character who could have been more developed to make a serious movie. This is a trick, remember? And while he stayed That way, people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and returned home happy.The end is always predictable, and the good guys take the gallon and the bad guys go to jail, the old loyalty theme is once again emphasized and all is well when it ends well. <br /> <br /> So, is this what makes this movie almost classic? <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bacchan as Haryanvi. <br /> <br /> Prakash Mehra has created yet another icon in Chuck the story, the characters and the plot.My brands are for Amitabh alone.
