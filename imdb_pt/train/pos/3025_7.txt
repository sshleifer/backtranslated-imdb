Bacall does well here - especially considering that this is only his second movie. This is often overshadowed because it ranks between two great hits: "Have and Do not Have" (1944) and "The Great Sleep" (1945), both of which matched her with Humphrey Bogart. Granted this is not on par with the other films, but I guess not because of it's own. I think there was some mistake in getting her to play a lady of British high society. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were distracting-Boyer certainly was not Spanish. It was hard to keep straight from what country people were. <br /> <br /> I liked cinematography in black and white. Humor is used for a great effect - especially liked the fog scene. Lighting also does a great job, increasing intrigue and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is simply beautiful. Boyer simply does not fit into the role of main romantic man for me - so he and Bacall together were a little strange. Not a great chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still really liked this photo. There is great tension and it moves well enough. I must say that I found the murder of the girl quite bold for this period film. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as support cast. Paxinou as the guardian of the hotel is absolutely vile and evil in his portrait. Her only scene in which she laughs madly as Mr. Muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the killer of the child is quite disturbing. Lorre also does very well in his picture of snake and slimy Contera - a cowardly con artist to the end. Wanda Bendrix also does very well in portraying the child Else - especially considering that this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (although she looks much younger). It turns out that she later married Auie Murphy, which proved to be a stormy and short marriage.
