Some movies that you know you will love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. Tracing his origins to "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the 1940s - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 1990s. Nick Cage plays the main character of "Down on His Luck" who gets entangled in a murder plan for husband and wife - and his fate goes from bad to worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people, city, violence and threat of Red Rock West. Lots of twists and turns, great performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic musical background, and direct direction make it a real joy. Favorite Line: When Cage looks at the empty gas meter in the car, he shakes his head and says, "F *** in the story of my life."
