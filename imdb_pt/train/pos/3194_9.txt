There was never anything like that, for sure. This seemingly redundant, episodic trilogy only makes really sense as a whole and as such is not a movie about Groovin 'Gary, a cross-dressing sensation in Utah. It's very self-conscious a film about how filmmaker REAGE to Groovin 'Gary. For Harris, the whole project is clearly an extensive and spectacular contortion of guilt and regret. He is trying to atone for his sins - yes, Gary attempted suicide after the initial document aired - through correction, comment, and convention, claiming these Hollywood narratives as the best friend and the happy final challenger (two different, with a revealing adjustment in the Glover version) and transform them into their own very personal uses. So while thematically remains a film about gender and difference, the structure ensures that it is also a movie about MOVIES - but at an almost unprecedented level of complexity. There is so much going on; In telling and retelling this story, Harris is in the right place, at the right time, three times in a row, and he does not lose the opportunity to do any of this. Immensely moving, and as deep as the field ever comes.
