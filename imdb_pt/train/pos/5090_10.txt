I loved this movie Great storyline and actors and good movie sets. He told the story in a way that I can easily understand and pay attention without falling asleep. I'd like to know where I could get the soundtrack. I can not find him anywhere. Please email me if you know where I could get the soundtrack. In addition to not being able to find the soundtrack, I find the film fascinating. Swayze did a great job. I think this is one of his best jobs. His previous films were OK, but this one really told a story for a change. This will go down in history as one of the best TV movies ever shown. Congratulations to the producers and writers of such a great work.
