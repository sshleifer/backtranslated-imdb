This was one of those movies that I probably would have never picked out on the shelf, but one day it came on the IFC and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I had changed the channel, I would have really lost a treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is depressing - young author paralyzed in convalescence of escalation in low-class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to make it a tearful manipulator. But this is not because it was written by Neal Jimenez, after he himself was accidentally paralyzed. No Hollywood happiness here. All patients in the ward come from totally different backgrounds, but share a sense of helplessness, of being at the mercy of others. Stolz is very good as a kind of "lone wolf", forced to depend embarrassingly on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is very much like an old lady whose family is crumbling; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a determined tough guy to make someone pay to take away their independence. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
