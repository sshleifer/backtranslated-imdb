In the film, several references are made subtly to the Blade Runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact that the Cain 607 and its unit are all genetic constructs, which can be expendable warriors. But as my favorite line from the movie is, "you should have done them as well as fast." Kurt Russell did an incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of reporting the story, then the rest of the cast combined. Even when he falls in love with Sandra, but does not know how to deal with those emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his shudder when given a hug, and his attachment to the dumb boy that in many ways reminded Todd of himself even, and what he might have been if it had not been for his selection to be a soldier.
