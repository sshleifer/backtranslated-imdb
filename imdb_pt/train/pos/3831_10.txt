This is a free adaptation of Clarence Mulford's novels; Fans of the Willaim Boyd films will probably feel a little at sea (and the comments here so far reflect this). But I met Hopalong's novels first, and I never cared much about Boyd's movies when I got close to them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise choice - he did not do a nostalgic "western"; instead, he approached Cassidy's story as a slice of what we used to call "American"; or what the older critics called "homespun." As the film unfolded, I remembered more and more of the great Hallmark Theater version of Mark Twain's Roughing It with James Garner narrating. Both films remind us that although movies about the "old west" will probably always be mythical to Americans, they do not have to be "Western"; they may well just be movies about what it means to be American at that time, in that place. <br /> <br /> I never feel attracted by watching this movie; there is no effort to push the legacy of Boyd-Cassidy down our throats, without irony, without camp. Consequently, I have the impression that these characters walked - or rode - across all of western real America that I too could have walked a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Given that the clarity of the film - positively avoids anything we call "style" - is all in your favor; and the simple performance of the performers fits this perfectly; Wow, it really looks like a story told around a campfire on a cattle road - no visual dressing, just the quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect from the good storytelling of a thread of adventure. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, and if the viewer puts aside acculturated expectations, he or she will find considerable pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie 9 stars, but I'll give it a ten just because most reviewers here completely missed the point; and I urge you to leave Boyd's memories aside and give this movie another chance. Note 1: One reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots dead people in this movie instead of firing the weapons from his hands. (to Boyd's Cassidy wing); first, Cassidy shoots dead people in the novels; Second, if Cassidy was a real cowboy, he would have killed people - the problem of taking weapons from people's hands is that they can always get another weapon - which happens to be part of the subtext of the same movie. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, that they have the Director of "The Godfather" among them, who may have every opportunity to make movies that I can not; but a good movie is a good movie; and this is a good movie. If it's from someone with the name "Coppola", well, that's just how it is. America is the land of opportunity (or was, until Bush took office) - that's what the great American novels are all about.
