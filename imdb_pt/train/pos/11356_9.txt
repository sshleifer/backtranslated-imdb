This is a great movie. These are many things: the search for a serial killer, the Soviet bureaucracy, the urge of a man, and the relationship between this man (the chief detective) and his superior. <br /> <br /> What ties me most is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (sorry for the bad spelling, please!). For some reason, it is moving to see its evolution of hostility and offense turning to respect and cameraderie and working together. One line in the film comes down to me: "He would say something witty, but he is overcome by emotion." <br /> <br /> Excellent acting from the entire cast, even the smallest parts were made with credibility. . <br /> <br /> This is not a fast-paced action thriller; in fact, it sometimes moves like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very gratifying and not exploitative of the crimes. <br /> <br />
