Bette Davis does a coolly entertaining performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film seems a little dated now in 2003. No doubt it's worth watching movie fans and fans of Bette Davis, but may not have as much appeal to the movie watcher of today. It was amazing for me to see how young Ms. Davis seems to be in this movement. The actors make performances that are basically sound and the story is significant and interesting. Leslie Howard is well chosen as Philip Carey, the medical student of club feet. This is a movie with a strong message about who we choose to love and why. However, "Of Human Bondage" does not seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt a little indifferent and detached about the movie after seeing it. I have an intuition that this may be the reaction the director was wanting. You are the judge! <br /> <br />
