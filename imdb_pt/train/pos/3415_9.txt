This movie was incredible. It is an inspiring piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed through the truth that the director, Lucy Walker, brings to the film. I recommend this to anyone looking for that special movie that shows humankind in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker shows the beauty of the landscape. This film is a true example of man versus nature and sometimes man vs. woman. men. The internal turmoil and triumph are tremendous in their subject matter. The subject of how the Tiebtans see blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker gave a voice to Erik Weihenmayer when he normally would not have been heard. Thank you Lucy for being true to your vision as a filmmaker.
