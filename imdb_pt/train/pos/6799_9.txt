This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say you have to start from the beginning, but I have to say I got a little confused from the beginning! <br /> Clark picks up a blow to the head and wakes up on the floor of Fairview Mental. Institution and is ridiculed for believing that he is a superhero. Clark is informed that the life he knew was all in his head. He also finds some things that are unusual: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is stuck in a wheelchair with limbs cut off after the accident on the bridge; and Lana is dedicated to Clark. But he finds a familiarity; Someone more dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also thinks that a mental patient is also from the known world of Smallville. And the doctor is a fugitive from the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me of a Buffy episode called "Normal Again," where Buffy begins to have vivid dreams about a mental asylum. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was an invention of her imagination and that, in fact, she was crazy. Her parents were still married, they still lived in Los Angeles, her friends did not exist, Angel was never her boyfriend and she did not have a sister named Dawn. Demons and vampires did not exist either. Both episodes are a bit sad because doctors are not just telling the characters that it's all their imagination, but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and that brings us back to reality. It is good, however, to have a sense of reality from time to time, but we watch these shows to escape reality. It's good again because the characters need to overcome new challenges.
