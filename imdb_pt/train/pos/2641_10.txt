Green Eyes is a great movie. In the current context of supporting our troops, it is interesting that this film showed the lack of respect that the soldiers received when fulfilling their duty during that period. From a historical point of view, the end of the Vietnam war left us all with something to remember and learn. Gene was very proud of this film, and he deserved the credits he received for writing "Green Eyes." I agree, I do not understand why this movie is not shown more often, or at all. This movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on TV every year, much like the Wizard of Oz. The dedication of a man to his lost son is utterly moving. I was Gene Logans' friend and was proud to meet him. Rocky
