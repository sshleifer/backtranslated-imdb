I liked the innocence of this movie and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. The gorilla looks great, and the eyes were especially vivid. It's even a little scary at times and should have kids a little scared without going overboard. Rene Russo plays her wonderfully feminine role. Usually, these types of Hollywood movies that happen in the past feel the need to create a villain villain, but the only opponent is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans, how they feel the same emotions as us, and yet how we really can not treat them like people because they are not. There are not many movies that venture into this territory and it's worth seeing if you want to contemplate the similarity between humans and animals.
