Really good horror movie with the biggest ones, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) is on an expedition in Africa trying to find an ancient meteorite. After finding him, Rukh is poisoned by his radiation. Everything he touches dies and the dark side of Rukh makes him become a selfish killer. His friend, Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) finds a limited remedy for the problem and, at the same time, realizes that radiation could be used for the good of humanity for the cure of diseases. The two demons will fight for radiation possibilities. Very good special effects. Others in the cast: Frances Drake, Frank Lawton, Beulah Bondi and Frank Reicher.
