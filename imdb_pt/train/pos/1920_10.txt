Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate must deal with their two teenage daughters and strange son ... But after John Ritter's untimely death, the show turned out to be more about dealing with the loss of a loved one ... < > <I found this show by going through the channels one afternoon and I have to say that I was laughing until my ribs ache, simply in the range of characters; the witticisms and the situation where Paul would be dealing mainly with his daughters ... From then on, I took the rest of the show when I was free and I have to say that the writing was very good ... But then I read about John Ritter's death ... Soon after, I watched 'Goodbye' part 2 and I have to say I was almost crying, watching the emotions of the characters, missing a loved one ... How Rory hits the wall with anger and frustration . ..Cow Cate deals with having to sleep in his bed alone .... Briget and Kerry talking about what they should have done. <br /> <br /> But the show goes on, bringing with it Jim Egan and CJ Barnes who give a great laugh, as Cate's father tries to protect his family and give 'talk about man's issues' to Rory ... But the real gem is CJ ... which is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin. <br /> Always will be the masterpiece of John Ritter.
