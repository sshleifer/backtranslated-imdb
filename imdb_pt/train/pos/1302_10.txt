So often a band will get together for a re-union concert only to find out that they just can not get together. Not so here. This concert is just a glow of brilliance from start to finish. These three musicians obviously met in advance and planned and planned what was needed to ensure that this was not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy one's ego. This is obvious from the beginning, before they even entered the stage. Many faces in the crowd were not even born when these guys introduced themselves for the first time. From the first song they catch that old magic that was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, without fuss. Clapton, by his own admission, said he had to stretch to this show because there were no keyboards, synths, etc., so we can see it at its best. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many drummers today speak of him as a kind of drum guru. Jack Bruce is great. They have actually managed to assemble a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years. This is a 10 for me.
