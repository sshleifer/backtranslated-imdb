The daughter's words are poetry: "I can not go in another year. I have to get to a hotel room". "I lost my blue scarf in a sea of ​​leaves." "The marble faun is moving ... he just gave us a washing machine. That's the deal." "I'm pulverized by this last thing." "Raccoons and cats become a little boring for a long time." "... any little mouse nest, mouse hole I'd like more." And there is wisdom in the mother's words: "... yes, the pleasure is all mine." "This little book will keep me straight, like a dye." "You always have to do everything correctly." "Where the hell did you come from?" "... bring me my little radio, I have to have professional music." "I am your mother. Remember me?" The mother / daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film. This is a Mother's Day movie.
