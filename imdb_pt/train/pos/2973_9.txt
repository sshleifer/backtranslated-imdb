Here is a movie that is genuinely funny at all times that it covers. How can it not be given that this film stars the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker? When I saw this movie for the first time, I did not immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent in acting and writing came out quite impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were actually Matt and Trey later. The humor is sometimes rude, sometimes dirty, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes loud and sometimes stupid, but overall, this is one hell of a movie that is undoubtedly under rated. Well, actually, it's insane. Totally insane.
