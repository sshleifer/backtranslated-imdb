Walking with the Men of the Caves, presented by Alec Baldwin, is a retrospect of all species of hominids (ie, us!) Of the last 5 million years: who they were, how they were and how they were extinguished. In addition to being a very interesting scientific look at the information we have about these species, Walking with Caveman also examines what makes us human. I waited several weeks to watch this, and I was not disappointed.
