The Young Victoria is a beautiful film and presented Queen Victoria in a light different from what everyone thinks about it. The films erase Queen Victoria's "I'm not funny" impression and show that she was a cheerful young woman. <br /> <br /> As I love history, particularly Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw this movie announced, I was so excited and counted the days until I hit the theaters. I was a bit worried that it would not be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I discovered new facts about Queen Victoria that I did not know before and that interested me a lot. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria in many lights was one of our greatest Monarchs, and this film painted a picture of her. real personality and how his life was. She was badly abused by her mother counselor, Sir John Conroy, because he wanted Britain to have a regency. That was what inspired Victoria to be a fantastic queen, what she was! The romance between her and Albert was so profound and this was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, both brilliant! The young Victoria is a heartfelt love story, but at the same time a great look at an important part of British history ... I love it !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... without a doubt!
