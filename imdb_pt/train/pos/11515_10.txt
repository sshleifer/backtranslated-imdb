It has been many years since I have seen this, but I feel compelled to defend this preciousness against those who criticize it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinions here. That's what I suppose. It is subjective. It loads through your funny bone at 60,000 volts or leaves you cold and wondering why you gave the time. <br /> <br /> This show has some of the best comic actors in Britain together in a story that is silly and irreverent and the result is hilarious. Dialogue and visual comedy are beautifully conveyed and the two clues (Cleese and Lowe) are excellent together. This was done for them. <br /> <br /> I can say no more than beg for you to meet and watch. You will not be disappointed and in a world devoid of gentle humor, this is a classic inane and harmless piece of comic brilliance.
