The Ramones, whom I consider the founders of modern punk rock, lend their unique sounds to a terribly distorted movie about a noisy rock fan (PJ Soles) who faces a ruthless and unhappy director (Mary Woronov) for rock music. <br /> <br /> Featuring a soundtrack full of incredible music, RRHS is fascinating in concept and execution. It's filled with rampant visual jokes (like the mouse experiment), adolescent spirit (probably my all-time favorite movie opening) and bizarre and extravagant moments (the straitjacket scenes). If you are looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun at a molecular level, look no further. But if you're looking for a good, dignified and dramatic epic, maybe you should look a little further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell, and this is Rock & Roll High School."
