This is one of the best movies out there and that is saying a lot that is for the television. I really wanted it to be in d.v.d. <br/> <br/> Helen Hunt gave such a crude performance. She played a rookie cop played in the serial killer case perfectly. When she collapses because he kills another kid, it was incredible. She's so lonely, so he comes to her. When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber as the serial killer was so shocking! He really brought her into his dark world. It was worthy of the Oscars. When he talks about killing the kids, scary! When he realizes who she really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They really do not do that anymore. It was a real thriller without being bloody.
