A wonderful surprise of Spanish cinema. I never thought Jordi Molla could be a director so good, after all, I do not really care much about his choice in movies. However, this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all ... something I always like! It not had much publicity and really do not think that will be launched in the North American market. We'll have to be content with the DVD or VHS if even that ... I do not want to say much about the story, because I do not want to spoil it for you, but basically the film is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for fun and to get some money from it (as veeeeeeeeeery), before he realizes that is immersed in a life that he was not telling.
