I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy" come out, but the movie definitely worth seeing. Playing the title character, Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role he brought to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a great job as his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a person very prone to make his skin crawl. <br /> <br /> All in all, this comes out as good as "Braveheart" (maybe even better). I laugh as I think of how Hollywood has released two films almost taking turns against England. Very good. Also starring John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
