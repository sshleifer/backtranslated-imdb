I'm writing this nine years after the last episode aired and I'm still recovering from the impact that Wildside had on me. <br /> <br /> It was effectively where several other police dramas were and were successful. But it took it further and did not stray from the realism of the streets, often portraying events and characters of life up to a T. <br /> <br /> I miss the series, instead we have the stupidity "Underbelly" who eventually dramatized and acted creating a whole load of American-Esquire rubbish. <br /> <br /> Wildside has remained true to the uniqueness of Sydney and so I am really grateful to this wonderful series. The performance was level A and it is a shame to see only a few actors have progressed in their careers while others have faded into obscurity. <br /> <br /> I do not want Australia to forget this wonderful part of your television story. So, I ask ABC to release the full series on DVD, not the top three. Give this series the end it deserves.
