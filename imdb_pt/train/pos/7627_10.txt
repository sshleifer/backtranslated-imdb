I remember watching this movie a while ago and after seeing 3,000 miles to Graceland, it all came back. Why has not this had a video or DVD release yet? It is a sacrilege that this majesty of making movies has never been released while other crap has been. In fact, this is the only John Carpenter movie that has not been released. Actually, I have not seen it on TV since the day I watched it. Kurt Russell was the perfect choice for the role of Elvis. This is definitely a role he was born to play. The pause of John Carpenter's horror brought this jewel that I would love for the TV to play again. It is well represented and well executed as far as the singing goes. Surrounding most of Elvis' biggest hits with enthusiasm. I think this was also the movie that formed the partnership with Russell and Carpenter, which made them do a lot of great movies (New York Escape, The Thing, Big Problem in Little China, and Escape from LA.) Someone has to release this before somebody make a remake or their own version of their life, which I feel would not only stain the king, but also ruin the magic that this one has, if this is not released then we will be at Heartbreak Hotel.
