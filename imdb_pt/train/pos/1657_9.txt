And this is especially true for lawyers and police officers. Puerto Rico, which boasts a small but powerful film producer, brings this multifaceted story of corruption, due to the drug cartel in progress that begins in South America, makes a stop on the island and then heading north America. Steven Bauer, the most recognizable face on screen here, leads a cast of top actors in a story of "Can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd?" Ricardo Mendez Matta mainly directs the adventure action for American television, in a script written by Matta, along with Poli Marichal. The rest of the cast (Elpidia Carrillo, Magda Rivera, Jose Herredia, Luz Maria Randon, to name a few) give themselves such good roles in a movie that makes you think "is there any respectable character here?" Speaks in Spanish with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA, this movie contains bursts of vulgar language, brief flashes of nudity, adult content and violence, some of which are quite shocking.
