On the surface, this is an above-average post-war romantic comedy. Below the varnish, is the MGM character actor who makes more fun projections. <br /> <br /> The leads are direct, but all the secondary ones are very much against the type. Margaret Hamilton (aka Wicked Witch of the West), Edward Everett Horton (obsessive-compulsive fussbudget), and Sig Ruman (Marx's enemy in "Night in Casablanca" and the always wonderful "Night at the Opera") , playing a well-intentioned gang trying to unite the two sides instead of separating them as their "usual" characters would. <br /> <br /> He also scoffs at many romantic comedy conventions, which is another indication that this might not be as much a "direct" romantic comedy as it is an ironic reminiscence of the many postwar romantic comedies and their two-dimensional action characters. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once, with interruptions, so I can not be positive, but this movie may be one of those that worked best in the context of the time it was made, but it's less successful now that the viewers "see" these secondary characters through a completely different lens. I'm assuming this is the case when I give 9 stars. I thought it was hysterical.
