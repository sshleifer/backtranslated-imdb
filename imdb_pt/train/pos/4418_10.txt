I saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) held a question and answer session. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to believe that this is the first director and all praise for Harvey Keitel. Again, take the risk and set yourself free for a script he liked. <br /> <br /> Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, it tells the story of the young director on the transformation of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect this to be a movie about the revolution, your political stance is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the obvious love of movie directors (a great tribute to "Bicycle Thief") and some capricious scenes that work without being pretentious. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
