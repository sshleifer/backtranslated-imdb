I watched this last night and was impressed by the sincere plot, the excellent character development, and the good karmic vibe that emanates from the acting and the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without giving much of the plot, it begins with an ordinary colleague who moves every day to his office job, which is inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way, the protagonist and the varied characters he finds in his quest to be gentle on the dance floor learn lessons about each other and about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue about what dance in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it is not exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as here in the US <br /> <br /> The film is gay ; you'll laugh out loud at some of the vision jokes. However, it is also worth a difficult way to describe. All the characters in the movie are taken seriously, just as they are, and none of them are diminished because of their "imperfections." <br /> <br /> I've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends. It turns out a friend lent me the video about learning to dance. Is this synchronic or what? I think so, because now I'm really geeked to try. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family movie (small children may not understand, but teenagers certainly would) and smile at the genuine affection you see in it over and over again. <br /> <br /> They will make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery as it is perfect as it is.
