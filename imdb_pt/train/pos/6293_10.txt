Buster shines absolutely in this episode, which is the only vehicle I saw at the end of his career that allowed him to make physical (and silent!) Comedy that made him famous. It's still a shock to hear his voice hoarse on the talkie strings - his voice is the only thing that does not interest me as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to make a stop is still unparalleled. He even repeats some of the jokes used in his first two releases with Roscoe Arbuckle. <br /> <br /> My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for introducing us to this episode, and for giving genius all of Buster's grasp. He did not have much time (one episode) to do it, but this is a tribute to the greatest Hollywood genius.
