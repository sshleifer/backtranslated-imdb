`Castle of Blood '(also known as' Castle of Terror') is a surprisingly frightening entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black-and-white cinematography, flawless dubbing, excellent casting, fairly logical scripts, deliberate pacing, and a surprise (though totally appropriate) have made that difference. Only movies sometimes distort music and the abrupt "love at first sight" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) is a surprisingly entertaining film. <br /> <br /> While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghost stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about the afterlife. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he can not survive tonight at Blackwood Castle, one night after Halloween when the dead walk. Alan can not pay the bet, so he bets his life for a £ 10 bet. <br /> <br /> Unlike Mario Bava's 'Black Sunday' (also known as 'The Mask of Satan'), 'Castle of Blood' is quite restrained, making the few moments of violence even more terrible, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space films of the 60s. It's a shame that the only version of this movie I have found is a poorly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. Even so, it's worth seeing, and calls for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch and have fun with a movie that compares well with "The Haunting" by Robert Wise.
