I rented the movie (I do not think it was released here) expecting the worst. The previews made the film look awful. I was actually very surprised, it was worth watching; was vaguely scripted, almost like a piece of film. He's had some really funny moments and though flawed, it's an effective satire on the show and people on the show without being too blunt. It is flawed, especially by the terrible soundtrack of menacing 'comedy' effects, but overall, it looks honest and generally true to the form of the show in an Almanor style or Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> Moment is the fashion to be critical of Jerry Springer, he is also an easy target. Springer could have done Citizen Kane and would be proclaimed "the worst film ever made." I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. A piece of flawed but innovative and interesting film.
