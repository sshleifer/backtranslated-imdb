Since September last year, I have borrowed four to six movies a week from the Harold Washington Library, which has an impressive collection of DVDs. (HWL really is a circulating library: three-quarters of your movies are released at any time!) Recently, I was thrilled to find The Short Films by David Lynch. Yesterday, knowing little about the animated series, I picked up Dumbland. I'm here to report that, for David Lynch fans, watching the eight episodes is half an hour well past. <br /> <br /> The most striking feature of these brief pieces are the soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. The respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Accent of scandalous voices pause the ends. Physical violence provides the knocks. The chirping of the birds and the buzzing of the burrows graze the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The rhythm of gross animation often remains in sync with the sound, but the soundtrack itself seemed to Lynch's main interest in creating and spreading that work. In a way, these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms. <br /> <br /> That said, the situations are strange, ugly, deep, stupid and funny as hell. And there is enough room inside them to reflect on how absurd we humans can be. I can not say I'm going to attend the collection again, but for those who revel in the Inland Empire suite, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
