EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is easily the funniest stand-up show movie I've ever seen. Most stand-up acts usually have lulls at some point, but not these folks. For 90 minutes, there is not a moment that is not fun. From the moment Eddie makes a hilarious impression of Mr.T, the laughter does not stop. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was done in 1983, and Eddie did not do anything so funny. It is unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS that was not very funny at all. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're out there, please come back and do a movie show in the vein of DELIRIOUS. Believe me, your fans will love you for it. And I think you know that.
