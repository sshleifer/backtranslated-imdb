I would almost give 10 out of 10. However, there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are lacking in leadership that undermine the flow / continuity of the film. The plot is great and well composed; You will definitely want to watch this in a low voice to fully understand. The characters are complicated and so is the plot, expect to be given just enough information to stop scratching the head, is a movie where everything is explained in the end. The animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir results in a great movie that is unlike anything I've seen in the animation. It's a black and white movie and its dark silence in some scenes, so it's worth watching it on a good T.V or plasma. The voices of the characters save this film in its English version, but it would have been more convincing if there were some French accents to emphasize that Paris is happening, I liked it more in French with English subtitles. An all your well worth buying on DVD or BlueRay if they have it! And personally, if you liked this movie, you might also like it; Waking Life & Ghost in a Shell 2 Innocence, this is just a personal suggestion.
