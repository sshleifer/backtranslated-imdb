This was a lovely movie. A real movie to feel good when you need one. The story is light (this is not the wind took), but sometimes, you need this kind of plot. Funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and gorgeous costumes / wardrobes. <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV show ER) is WONDERFUL in this role. She is definitely a brilliant new star for Hollywood. Everyone should keep an eye on her, she will be BIG in the future. <br /> <br /> It also impressed the soundtrack of this film. A good mix of modern and Indian songs. I was dancing for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need.
