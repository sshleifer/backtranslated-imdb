This fun Bugs Bunny sketch sees the return of the still unnamed Marvin, the Martian and his K-9 helper, the green dog. <br /> <br /> This time instead of trying to destroy Earth, Marvin is on a mission to land, capture a creature from Earth and take it back to Mars. Of course the creature he chooses is Bugs Bunny. At first, Bugs thinks that Marvin and K-9 are pranks or antics, but realizes that this can not be right when Marvin dramatically raises the bug rabbit hole with a lightning gun. Bugs tries to escape the situation in two ways, including persuading Marvin that K-9 is planning a mutiny. Eventually, he is captured using an Acme force jacket ejecting bazooka. Surprisingly, for an Acme product, it works as advertised and Bug's is forced to use his intelligence to make the K-9 drop it, the tables soon turn and the two disgruntled Martians are tied and Bugs is trying to take the saucer back to the land. <br /> <br /> I really liked that, although the ending is a bit weak compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice has changed a little here and he's visibly emotional when he's angry, but that did not make me like him or the cartoon less.
