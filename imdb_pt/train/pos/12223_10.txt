I saw True Crime when it was first released in the mid-nineties and I have watched it many times since. It's a great mystery about Mary (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school student in a California town who's younger sister of a classmate was tortured and killed by an unknown killer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how brilliant she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this. True Crime seems very "real" or real to me. I read a newsgroup review, where someone wrote that the total suspension of disbelief is present here and is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, just like the other actors. The locations are right and writer / director Pat Verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and Mary's loneliness (see the scene where Mary wakes up from the dream sequence after seeing the photos she took of Tony). I wish Verducci made more movies. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any other movie like True Crime. 10/10
