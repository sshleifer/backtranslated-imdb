"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great films of director Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, he is full of incredible actors like Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. They are the type of character actors that Hollywood unfortunately does not employ anymore. In fact, the movie itself is the kind of movie that Hollywood does not do anymore. (The creators of "You've Got Mail" claim that your movie is a remake, but that's nothing more than much self-praise inflated.) Anyway, if you have a fondness for romantic comedies from the 1940s, you you'll find "The Shop Around the Corner" to be nothing short of wonderful. So good with repeated visions. Appreciate!
