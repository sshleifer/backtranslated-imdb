Why is not this movie in the top 250? This film still looks surprisingly new 56 years after its production, but could only have been made in the aftermath of W.W.II because of the perception of the proximity of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped at an unexpected time. And what after life? I liked the scene at the end with the trial and all the people of all nations gathered. The phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer - a typical British judge), Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesey) defending Peter Carter (David Niven) and also June (Kim Hunter) against the American promoter Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - there is a reason why is an American-). It's all so imaginative! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing film which is a true "tour-de-force". The message of the film is clear: in the universe the law is the most important, but on earth nothing goes beyond love among humans. The way this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any Hollywood movie could do.
