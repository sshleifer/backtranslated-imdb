The cast is excellent, the performance good, the plot interesting, the evolution full of suspense ... but it is difficult to fit all these elements into a movie that is only 80 minutes long. If more time were taken to develop plot and subplots, it would have a much better effect. Another 30 minutes of substance would make this movie very good and not just good.
