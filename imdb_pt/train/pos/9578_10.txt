As others have mentioned, all the women who are naked in this movie are almost all absolutely beautiful. The plot very cleverly shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around, they want to be pursued, but when there are no "men" around, they become the pursuers of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy becomes a very fast man (we must all be so lucky at this age!). He then raises the courage to pursue his true love.
