One thing about Hollywood, someone has a success and is always rushed to be copied. And another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson has received so much praise for his performance in the Texas Giant-based movie that Universal executives must have thought, let's quickly move to another modern setting in Texas. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Robert Stack received great reviews from The High and Mighty as the pilot who was breaking under the pressure of flying a damaged aircraft, it was natural to give him another fissure. paper. <br /> <br /> Both ends were achieved in Written in the Wind. Before Hudson became the master of the ranch, he is now the son of a hunting companion to Robert Stack's father, who placed Hudson under his wing. In other words, the part of James Dean without the racism of James Dean of Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that Hadley's Oil Company of Stack uses. Hudson likes her, but she is dazzled by the millions of Stack and when he courts a girl, he has the means to actually pursue a campaign. She marries Stack. <br /> <br /> And last, but not least, we have Dorothy Malone, who is Stack's amorous sister who has a craving for Rock but that Rock is not going to get involved with this wild child. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone spent over 10 years on a bunch of heroin roles in flickless movies before landing this jewel. She won a Best Supporting Actress Award for her role as Marilee Hadley and was well-deserved. <br /> <br /> If you like technicolor Fifties novel than this is the movie for you.
