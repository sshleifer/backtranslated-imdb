This man is nothing short of incredible. You truly feel as if you have lived his life with him during these tragic events, and weep together with your family in the end. He was so passionate about her cause, not just for himself, but to ensure that others who would survive him did not have to go through this miserable pain. I watch this video every time I'm having a bad or bad day, and it always makes me see the big, bright side of life, just like Jonny, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret is not knowing more about Jonny since I visited England twice during his lifetime and would have been able to say that I knew him. It's comforting to know that Jonny is sitting in his cloud without pain! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
