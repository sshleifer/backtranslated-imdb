This movie is my all time favorite !!! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie! I'm always on the moon, watching !! This is a movie, which you really have to see, also if you're not a fan of MJ, because this movie writes, like Captain EO, E.T. and Ghosts, a little film and music history !! This wonderful movie, out of Michael's pen, is a must have !! E: Smooth Criminal, it's really the most wonderful, exciting and incredible song I've ever heard !! Thank you Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to beat on this planet, he is a good man and he always brings glitter in your eyes when you listen to his music !! Please, if you do not know this movie, watch it and do not miss it, because it would be too bad for you if you lost !! Highly recommended movie, for all movie lovers.
