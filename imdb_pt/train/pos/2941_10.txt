This is the last one-man show where Eddie Murphy is at his best. Just forget the nut teacher and the distinguished gentlemen, this is the real Eddie Murphy. His imitations of Mr. T. (pretending to be gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are murderers. I think it's also very bold to make fun of artists who are really popular back then. My favorite act is one in which he is at his annual barbecue with the family and plays his drunken father and Aunt Bunny who falls off the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you feel down! If you watch the "Raw" sequence, do not be disappointed. It's very good too, but it does not go with 'Delirious'.
