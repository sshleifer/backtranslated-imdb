Like Ishtar and the King of Comedy, other great comedies poorly understood, Envy has great performances by two actors who interpret essentially losers (can be a very harsh word, I'll call them suburban suburban). <br /> <br /> This movie was a jewel of the dark comedy, and I'm not sure what people expect. I like to see a great studio comedy that is not full of obvious humor, and I believe the little moments in this movie are worth it. The look on Stiller's face as he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment, a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. Yes, it was a rather simple story, but examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (J-Man's decrepit "lakeside hut", Corky's unceremonious burial, the role of Weitz's wife and Walken's J-Man - all great. > t support people who come into the IMDb and mercilessly trash movies when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one. I'm going to be jealous of almost any of the ten fundraising comedies of the year (except Napoleon Dynamite.) It's more wittier, wackier and an unusual and nice jewel. <br /> <br /> Remember, most of the time, Popular is not equal to Good.
