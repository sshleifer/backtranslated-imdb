FREDDY has gone from scary to funny in this 6th edition of the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> It's been 2 years, actually 11 since this movie happened in 2001. And FREDDY killed all the boys in Elm. street, except one, John Doe (part 5 Jacobb, even the movie gives a hint of who he is), in which he uses to bring more children to come to Elm Street. Not only does FREDDY get his wishes, but he also gets his daughter back on Elm Street. When she finds out what's going on, she and other children decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We can also see some of FREDDY's mysterious backgrounds. Rachel Talalay, who has been restrained to the series nightmare for a long time so far. Many people hate this movie but I liked it. He tried to bring out what FREDDY was doing with his wisecracks ... COMDEY and makes the series funnier than scary So this movie really is a headache to talk about. It's not the wrost in the series, Part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
