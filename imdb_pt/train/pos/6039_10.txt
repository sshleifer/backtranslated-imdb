I was lucky to be an extra in this great film and I loved every minute of filming. I went to the premiere in London and had a great conversation for Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon as did my wife. Fantastic after the party too. Then, a few weeks later, I had a trip to the movies with members of our bicycle club. What a brilliant movie, it deserves to be there with all the big motorcycle movies. Now we have the DVD Sue, my wife can not have enough nor the children. Get some club dick that seems to think I'm a movie star now, oh, well, you can only dream. I think they're jealous. The only downside of the first part of the shoot was the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but hey we were in Wales. I hope there is an accompaniment, so keep me posted on Jon. Danny Beck
