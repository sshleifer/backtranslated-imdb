I can give you four reasons to see this movie: 1. Four of the best filmmakers in contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, related in a grand scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest problems in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good history of comic humor about authority practicing extortion against ordinary people and still waiting to be appreciated for their efforts. <br /> <br /> Next, Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second play with a history heir of Italian neorealism with a story of "Peter and the Wolf." <br /> <br /> In the third story, what seems most independent of this series, even in context, Carlos Carrera tells the story of a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But after the recent lynching in Tlahuac and the tradition in this terrible subject in the State of Mexico, this story could not be more updated. <br /> <br /> And in the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to black humor in the "grand finale" in which he brings together most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the best comedy pieces ever filmed. Reprising the central scene of one of his previous films "Todo el poder", Sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme. And by the way, give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti doing a brief striptease. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you have a bittersweet feeling of having watched a good movie (and maybe enjoyed it) with a very painful subject. They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own misfortune and this is the best example. This film bears witness to how Mexicans have learned to live in the middle of a state of crime (and perhaps have accepted it), between two fires: the criminals and the so-called corrupt authorities. Even this movie is a positive thought because almost all good people have been victims of crimes and they are not so unscathed. If you had a robbery without a scratch then you're lucky. Meanwhile, do not miss the chance to see this highly recommended movie. <br /> <br /> And it's a beautiful life in Mexico ...
