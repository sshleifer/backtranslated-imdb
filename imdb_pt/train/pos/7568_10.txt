I saw this my last day at the festival, and I was glad I stayed around that extra couple of days. Poetic, moving, and surprisingly funny, in a strange way. It is so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without seeming precious, or disturbing the balance. It can seem improvised, but completely controlled. I hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers really digested their influences (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their own style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene ), you're in for a real treat. This is a wonderful film and I hope more people see it. If this movie plays at a festival in your city, go! go! go!
