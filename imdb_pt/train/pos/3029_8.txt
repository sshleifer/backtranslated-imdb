The novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations of what Greene wrote; for example, the silent but somber humor that invades the scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the obsession of murdered children that takes part of the plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to ridicule. <br /> <br /> However, I do not want to suggest that the movie is bad in any way. It always seems the part and the story stays in the mind like a good 'un'. Some of the secondary characters were stock actors who could turn their backs on anything. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible shame that the movie is not available on DVD.
