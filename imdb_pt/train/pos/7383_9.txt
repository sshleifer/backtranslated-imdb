Extremely tense suspense set in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest nightmare of the third world in Brazilian urbanization. To make it easier for those who are curious about this intriguing and truly well done film, he has the guts of the Mexican "Amores Perros" feature with a character not far from Max Cady of both Cape Fears, although this is not, for any medium, a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay the murderer Anisio (Miklos) to his third partner (and majority shareholder) in said construction equipment. The murder is attributed to the city, but things start to look very gloomy when the witty, charismatic ambulatory nightmare Anisio decides that he wants to be close to the partners always so nervous in crime, not only invading but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict social codes . that make up the Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and he wants to get in. The visual is almost entirely portable, grainy, with exceptional performances everywhere, especially as a beginner (and member of the classic Brazilian pop band 'Titãs'), Paulo Miklos, dazzling and confused. the spectator with his rather funny social terror. <br /> <br /> I watched the film at the Brasilia Festival in November 2001. Since then it has performed very well in Sundance and Berlin. About Me
