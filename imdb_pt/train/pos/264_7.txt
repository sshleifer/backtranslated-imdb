Hickory Dickory Dock was a good mystery to Poirot. I confess I did not read the book, despite being an avid fan of Agatha Christie. The adaptation is not without its problems, there were times when humor, and there were brave attempts to hit, was a bit exaggerated, and the events that led to the final solution were rather rushed. I also found there were a few slow moments, so a little of the mystery was filled. However, I loved how Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, had a visual style much like the brilliant ABC Murders, and really set the mood with the dark camera work and dark lighting. The darkest moments were a little scary, this was aided by one of the most astonishing scores of a Poirot adaptation, perhaps not as disturbing as One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, though not as complicated as the Buckle My Shoe, and somehow that's a good thing. The acting was very good, David Suchet is flawless (I know I can not use that word forever, but I can not think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) as Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran do justice to their characters in a brilliant way. And the students had great personalities and were well developed in general, particularly Damian Lewis as Leonard. All in all, solid mystery, but do not rank over the best. 7,5 / 10 Bethany Cox
