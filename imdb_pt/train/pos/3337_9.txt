This is a great movie for real romantics and sports lovers. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is at his best in this movie. As a Drew fan, it was great to see her shine after several failures. I had my doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he totally delivered as Ben the comic and passionate about sports. The comedy in this movie is great, there were several moments of laughter. <br /> <br /> Their first date began when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick of eating a new place. earlier in the day. Instead of leaving, he helps her take care of her, helping her turn into pajamas, then cleaning her vomit in her bathroom and bathroom, then telling her that she was "a lot like a lady ... no chunks." All goes well between Ben and Lindsay all winter, but baseball season begins. Lindsay begins to realize just how obsessed Ben is with the Red Sox and why this apparently big guy is still single. She tries to shrug and think of it as a good thing because she has a busy work schedule and she will not feel guilty about working overtime while he's at games. She even buys all the books about The Red Sox she can find, including one about "Bambino's Curse." <br /> <br /> Everything is going very well until Lindsay has a false alarm after losing her period. Both make them realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person with whom she wants to be. A very touching part of the movie is that after she tells him she's menstruating, he sadly shows off a Red Sox shirt the size of a baby he bought in case she is pregnant. <br /> <br /> Eventually Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends' birthday party after she says "I had to check my calendar and when I saw the game there was a Red Sox / Yankee, I knew I was going to be deer. " Ben tells her that it was "the best night of her life." Shortly after receiving a call from his friend who went to the game, he gave up the party and told him "IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER !!!" Ben freaks about missing her and ends up really hurting Lindsay when she says "A few minutes ago you were saying that this was the best night of your life," he says "well, that was a few minutes ago." <br /> <br /> So they separate for a while, he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his tickets for the season he inherited from his uncle, because if he did not "remind him very much of which he gave for them. " Lindsay discovers through a friend and decides to stop him from realizing that he is doing it for her. He ends up very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball was shadowed by a deeper new love, Lindsay. They still go to the games and even participate in the World Series final and St. Louis, and it's a happy ending on all sides. 2 thumbs up !!
