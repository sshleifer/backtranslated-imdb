This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen - it has it all - a genuinely touching script, great actors who make subtlety a fine art to watch, a really classy novel (it's a shame that this kind of novel just does not seem to exist anymore ), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the last song), an artistic score, and costumes and scenery that make you want to live in them. The ending was just a disappointment in that I was expecting a spectacular movie to have a brilliant ending - but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of the movies out there. Definitely check this movie out - again and again. There are many details that you missed the first time you deserve a second look.
