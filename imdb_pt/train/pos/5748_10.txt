This film was excellent - the emotional power of the performances of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this movie had been released in late 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce would certainly be at least nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. Definitely a must see!
