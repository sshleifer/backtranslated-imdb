Quick and simple, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As some others have mentioned, I'm not from the South too, I do not care about country music, and I've never worn a cowboy hat. (I never drove in a car with a corpse in my trunk too, but I love "Goodfellas".) That's just a great movie. Filmed at a ratio of 2.35 and beautifully transferred to DVD. (The VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a great love / hate story in Texas with great acting. Travolta is fantastic. Next to "Pulp Fiction" is the best thing he did. It's been in my top 5 for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Check this one !!! It's a 10 !!!!
