A comforting film. The usual excellent performance of John Thaw, who recently spent. A man who has always been so unpretentious. He was one of the 10 best actors in England of my time. <br /> <br /> He can be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan on the hit TV series of the '70s the Sweeney and as a lawyer in Kavanah QC. A must see for the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. Filming will bring back some memories for people who remember Britain during the war and certainly those who were evacuated from London to escape the German bombardments. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and boy William were very well interpreted and faithful to Michelle Magorian's book.
