A truly lovely heroine who is sometimes startled and terrified by gossip, struggles with mattresses, runs in front of closed doors ... just a few of the moments that glow in my memory of "The Naked Truth." I LOVED what I got from this show: fun scenarios and some good supporting characters provided the backdrop for the show's diamond - Tea Leoni as 'Nora Wilde'; beautiful, clown and wonderfully accident-prone - How refreshing to see an actress who knows how to make a clown - no wonder Hollyood does not know how to climb it. But where-oh-where are the DVD releases? The amount of (beep) they release, it's amazing that this little jewel is still buried. (Someone, please correct me if I'm wrong.)
