It was a Saturday night and a movie called BASEketball was on TV. I always wanted to watch, but I never got it when I was in the movies. Boy, I was wrong. Words can not describe how funny this movie is, starring the creators of South Park, who share a natural chemistry on the screen when they are funny. I recorded the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time, I've seen it seven times! I'm obsessed with this, and I know anyone who enjoys trey and matts work will enjoy this movie. ONE MUST SEE, THIS IS MY # 1 FOOD OF ALL TIME
