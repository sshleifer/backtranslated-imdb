Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world are gathered in this film to present their views and ideas on the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you'll ever see in any movie. Movies like this are rarely made and appreciated. This movie tries to play in all possible WTC nuclei. Here are some of the movie's most important stories that make this movie so unique. <br /> <br /> There is the story of Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) where some people from Iran are preparing for the attacks of America. There is a teacher trying to educate her students by informing them of innocent people being killed in the WTC massacre. Then comes a story by Youssef Chahine (Egypt) where a filmmaker comes face to face with a Dead Soldier in the WTC attack and a Mortal Core terrorist who was involved in the WTC attack. Then we see a story of Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), where a group of five innocent children sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win America's reward money. Then we see the story of Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico) where you see a black screen and slowly you see the actual footage of the WTC buildings coming down. And the people who are stuck in the building are jumping to save their lives. The other most important story is from Mira Nair (India) where a mother is struggling to get respect for her dead son, whose name is falsely stuck in the WTC massacre! After the Sept. 11 attack, our heartbeat begins to pump automatically if we hear two names anywhere in the world. First is the World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point, claiming something more for it. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to everyone who likes to have such types of Home DVD Collection. Definitely worth every penny you spend. But please do not expect anything other than the movies on this DVD. There are, of course Filmographies of Film Makers, but no extra features.
