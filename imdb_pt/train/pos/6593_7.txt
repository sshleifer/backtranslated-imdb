I have watched this movie twice now and I think it is very good for the limited equipment used to create this movie. (filmed in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory about the migration of South American pre-colubian Indians to the islands of Polynesia by rafts of large rafts. This documentary accompanies Dr. Heyerdahl and the team as they select ferry trees in Equidor and float with them downstream to the Pacific for assembly in Peru. They depart on a 101-day sea adventure testing the strength of their primitive raft, surviving only by the means available to the natives of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
