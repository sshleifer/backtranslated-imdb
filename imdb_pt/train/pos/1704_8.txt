"I moved here to get away from that sort of thing!" The sheriff of the small town regrets. <br /> <br /> "Does this happen a lot in Chicago?" Your vice asks. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians confuse a Halloween Rebroadcast from Orson Welles' World War as an account of a true Martian invasion and conclude that they need to take action! What follows is a lot of setbacks involving the random attempts of Mars to conquer the city of "Big Bean, IL." Everyone concludes that they are children with really good clothes, except for the daughter of the sheriff and his friend, a child dressed as a duck. <br /> <br /> The Martians themselves are comic, and you get the impression that they are not a threat to them. no one but themselves early. It's a fun family movie.
