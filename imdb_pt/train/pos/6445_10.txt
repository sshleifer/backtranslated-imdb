In addition to excellent direction, production, performance and predictable drama are an essential message in the roadmap: "Listening takes all the way" For the voice to flourish, listen.To harmonize with the other voice, listen. To get closer, listen. To find out the needs of any situation or others, listen. It seems the writers are conveying a "secret of life." The reading leads to the perception of the Being itself. It awakens the other senses, especially the vision and expands the horizon. The soul can also be discovered. The art of this film "As it is in heaven" magnificently displayed the unfolding of life, not only its joy and sadness, but ultimately life expectancy. All this by the first instruction of the main personage to the choir; <br /> <br /> "Just listen, this leads all the way"
