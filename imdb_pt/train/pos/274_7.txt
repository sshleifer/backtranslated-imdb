I watch most of the films that Nick Mancuso is in, because, frankly, I love the guy, even though as he ages he's usually picked as the villain (longtime fans should note that he's somehow blonde in that movie). It is a rather familiar movie in terms of plot (but most movies nowadays is not exactly original), but Rick Roberts is attractive because the imperfect husband, Martha MacIsaac is equally attractive as the daughter, and Mitzi Kapture does a good job , if that was your goal, to be angry and sometimes very difficult to like. Nick still got it in terms of showing charm and psychosis. However, much of the storyline happens off-screen - such as motivation, past behaviors, good times and bad times - and things that seem apparent to the characters never reach the audience (ie me). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the category "but what if ..." and, overall, I can not say that I care much about any of the characters. That being said, it was what it was - a reasonably fun way to spend the afternoon - and I still like Nick.
