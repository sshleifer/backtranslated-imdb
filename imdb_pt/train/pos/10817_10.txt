Well, this movie was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad that you just have to laugh, and acting, well, let's say it's not Gibson's honey. But Gary Browning, who plays a cop, is so bad it becomes good. I do not know how, but he even makes this movie a 10. You should see if your in horror / slash movies cause your blood and funny at the same time. Killer movie.
