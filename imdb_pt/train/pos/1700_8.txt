I loved this movie. you have to respect the dwarves who dress like little Martians. Of course the story may have been lean at times, but you can not take it off the way it was made. I used to watch it over and over again when I was 8 years old. It's a children's movie and, moreover, has some of the best quotes ever. Blanzee's interpretation of "Home on the Range" is incredible. <br /> <br /> very well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
