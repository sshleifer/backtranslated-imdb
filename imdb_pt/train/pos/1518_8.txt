THE HOUSE WHICH DRUG BLOOD is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. If THE MONSTER CLUB is included as part of the series, this will produce eight films. Although, the film is very different from the others. <br /> <br /> I see the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I used to love them as a teenager. My feelings for them today are equally strong. <br /> <br /> I spent many years trying to track this movie. The synopses of the stories were so appealing that I even paid a substantial sum for it when I finally found a copy. As good as the movie is, I felt a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It was not as good as I was led to believe. Although better than his two predecessors, he is not nearly as good as his four successors, as I shall show. <br /> <br /> The liaison story shows John Bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person living in a mysterious old house. His journey begins at the local police station, where he learns the stories of former occupants. The bonding story later sees him visiting the real estate agent who sold the house. Although this binding story seems appealing on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any Amicus anthology. I could not help feeling that John Bennett is a poor version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I'd rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in their role. We could even have the two here - one as a police inspector and one as a real estate agent. They could, and believe they could, have brought this weak element of the film to life much better. <br /> <br /> The film contains four stories, each of which focuses on one inhabitant of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story shows Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories. He is absorbed in an exciting story about a strangler, even drawing a sketch to aid his writing. Soon after, he begins to have visions of his own creation. Peter Duffell's excellent directing, particularly with the choice of camera angles, helps to narrow down the script. Elliott's performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story. The story ends with a semi-twist, but I could not help but get the feel of a script that did not allow it to live up to its potential. <br /> <br /> The second story shows Peter Cushing going to the house. He is a lonely man who is still yearning for a beautiful young woman who once left him and from whom he keeps a photo. Cushing's performance really brings this moving story to life. He is assisted by the director who chooses to include the solid focus on Cushing's loneliness. This is carried on with a great scene of hallucination that helps us see inside Cushing's mind. Anyway, Cushing sees a figure in a nearby wax museum that looks like his girl. Of course, her obsession grows, but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist in the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's rival, but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story is easily the best watch Christopher Lee - my all-time favorite horror actor - enter the house with his daughter. Mr. Lee gives one of his perfect chilled performances here. He does not show love or care for his daughter. He even brings a housekeeper from the school to educate her. The housekeeper, played by Nyree Dawn Porter in another of her great performances, tries to figure out what's wrong. Without revealing much, I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. The presence of Christopher Lee is really thrilling in every scene he's in. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the most frightening character in the entire film. The movie is worth seeing, even to see just this story. <br /> <br /> The final story is interpreted almost entirely by laughter, but it certainly is fun and that's what matters. Jon Pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house. He is very dissatisfied with the approach that his producers make to the films, seeing everything as cheap and fake, especially the costumes. So he decides to buy an authentic robe for his most recent vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent appearance as a merchant who sells Pertwee an old mantle. When Pertwee puts on the cloak, he begins to develop fangs and basically turns into a vampire. Pertwee's performance has to be seen to be believed. It's really hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story, but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much bigger. <br /> <br /> Link history ends with a loose connection to the final story. This is particularly appropriate since the inspector was looking for Pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house. The rest you will be able to find out for yourself. No matter how weak the bonding story is, it has a decent ending, though unintentionally not comical. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the blame for the deficiencies in what should have been a truly magnificent film is not with Peter Duffell, the director, who really does his best with what he has. I think the script was very restrained and without the ambition that can be found in the four subsequent films. <br /> <br /> In general, THE HOUSE WHICH THE BLOOD DROPED, despite its flaws, is a must for fans of the film. Amicus anthologies, fans of other Amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies. If my resume provides the film with enough appeal in your eyes, check it out. You'll have fun!
