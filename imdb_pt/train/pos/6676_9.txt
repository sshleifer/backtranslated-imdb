****** ATTENTION: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ************** <br /> <br /> So, who are these "Mystery Men?" Simply put, Mysterious Men are a group of sub-heroes who desperately try to live their adolescent fantasy lives while shredding both their real identities and their super identities. Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, he leaves his wife and children at home as he crosses the street looking for crimes to counter with his unique and unique Shovel fighting style. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silver for the newlyweds during the day and drags tablecloths into crazy villains at night if his mother is not occupying him with the latest gossip. Furioso works in a garbage dump to earn his salary, then takes his frustration out with his friends at night, throwing malicious phrases to friends and foes, and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone indignant). ?) Ben Stiller breathes such a life in this character, you can not help but love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend the nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they dreamed of ... becoming real. Super heroes. Obviously, this could happen. Champion City has the Incredible Captain, after all ... a flying super-cop and fighter with enough corporate logos in his costume to stop one or two extra bullets. Greg Kinnear has a stellar performance as a middle-aged man trying to recapture the attention of his fans in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring back that 'extra magic' that can gain endorsement again, C.A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, an exaggerated threat from WAAAAAY, who plays with Goeffrey Rush's refreshing perfection. This lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to distort Champion City into a reflection of his own insanities ... and ends capturing C.A. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mysterious Men to stop the evil plan of Frankenstein, but with goons like the Discus Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio will need a little help. <br /> <br /> Recruitment begins, and after a painful recruiting party. , the team settles with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent of the team, with his mystical bowling ball apparently enlivened by the vengeful spirit of his dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who KILLS becomes invisible when ABSOLUTELY NOBODY is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), received a mystical and powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much-underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to hack guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting puzzles and acting super-wise. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a joke between genres. Anyone who wants to shoot movies in small categories is fighting a losing battle. This is a parody / parody of the genre of superheroes - from pseudo-Burton sets recycled indefinitely (and occasionally decorated with more lying material) to ridiculous costumes, the genre of comics gets a good farewell. But at the same time, it's a serious superhero movie as well. Both at once. Although not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this film is somehow reflective of D.C. Comic's Inferior Five work, short), it's quite innovative for the big screen. He offers the comic book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then casts the inevitable desires - and we all know, if the superheroes were real, then these guys would be real. If the Big Guy with the S was flying around New York City, you'd see half a dozen reports about idiots in underwear getting their asses kicked out regularly. Of course, the Shoveller fights very well, and the Blue Raja casts with great accuracy - all parts of the superhero world. But does that make them genuine superheroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a comedy, albeit somber. Inevitable, while trying to point out the ridiculous nature of super heroes. A-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous chunks to throw off. Particularly wonderful is Janeane Garofalo's dialogue with her bowling / father ball. However, it is not a comedy in the sense of collateral laughter or eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never ventures completely into any of it. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie, in the end, is that it's very engaging. The good weak / weak are eventually justified and, for a brilliant moment, they really become superheroes; justice is served; and the film ends with a scene that smells like realism (as much realism as it is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the movie, the movie can be a great joke. <br /> <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani is bored and unfocused like Mr. Furioso's love interest despite having a key role as his conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, though his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villains are never more than armed lackey (a point of which is made in the film). Cinematography is unstable and disjointed (as it happens in the regular comic book, so it's excusable), music sometimes dominates the stage, and special effects are never very integrated with the rest. <br /> However, in general, this movie is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really enjoy this movie, but it's a fun joke and a good way to kill a few hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
