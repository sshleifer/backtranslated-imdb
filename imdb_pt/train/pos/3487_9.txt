Wrestlemania 14 is not often seen as one of the great Wrestlemania, but I would personally say, in my top 5, if not the top 3. There are so many good things, and this really meant the birth of the Age of Attitude, which was Best Time of WWE, in my opinion. HBK has the heart of a lion, and he putting Austin as he, on leaving, was pure class on his part. It has one of the hottest crowds you've ever seen, and it has J.R and The King announcing it best! <br /> <br /> Games. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? Royal LOUD pop battle team for the return of L.O.D. I'm not a fan of Battle Royal, and this is more of an average. Very predictable, even when you see it, it's obvious that L.O.D would win. Looking at Sunny for 8 or more minutes, it definitely helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF World Heavyweight Championship <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Vs Aguila. <br /> <br /> Taka has an amazing pop with his input. Fast, flying high and very exciting. If these two had more time, they would surely have ripped the roof off with their things. Taka wins with the Michinoku rider. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here, is Chyna is handcuffed to Slaughter. Good pop for Owen, mixed reaction for Trips. A very, very underrated game, which is among my favorites for Wrestlemania, actually. The two mingled very well, and Owen can go with anyone. Trips wins, with interference from Chyna. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> Mixed Tag Combination. Marc Mero and Sable Vs Goldust & Luna. Defining pop for Sable, unpublished of the time, for woman. Sable really looks hot, and the crowd is just eating her!. Sable's constant singing, and they erupt almost every time she enters the ring. Not bad for a mixed tag game, it had fun tricks and it was fine. Sable's team wins when Sable hits the TKO. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock | C |. Before reviewing the game, I would like to note that The Rock has shown its immense potential, with its interview with Jennifer Flowers, before its departure. Good pop for Shamrock, great heat for The Rock. Very disappointingly short, and I thought the ending was kind of stupid, although Shamrock's antics were incredible to watch, and the audience went wild for it. Rock retains the title when The Ref reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Combat Dumpster, WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws. The Outlaws are not as finished as they would be at the moment. The crowd is actually a little bit dead from that, but I thought I had some great parts of Hardcore, with some sickening problems. Cactus and Terry win the titles at the end. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Kane. Great ovation of time, for the Undertaker. Much better than at Wrestlemania 20, and for a big man vs big man match, this was very good. It was a big fight, with The Undertaker giving a beating on the table. WWE was smart, making Kane look strong even with defeat. After 2 tombstones, Taker finally puts him out with a third. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. <br /> <br /> Special Guest Guest "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Vs Steve Austin. Great heat for Tyson. Crowd goes to Austin, definitely one of the biggest pops I've heard. Mixed reaction, for HBK. This is really a special game, one of the biggest events in the history of wrestlemania, you can tell when the J.R is out of breath. HBK gives it all in what should be his last game, and Austin has rarely been better. The animosity and electricity of the crowd is incredible, and it is as exciting as it sounds. Austin wins with the stunner, with Tyson joining at 3:16, knocking out Michaels. Austin's commemorative victory, it's a wonder to see, with one of the noiest crowd you'll ever see, King said that's right, they were freaking out. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Wrestlemania 14 is one of the biggest real. It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania and it really started the Age of Attitude. This is very special to me because it was the 1st Wrestlemania I've ever seen in '98. "The Austin Age has already begun!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
