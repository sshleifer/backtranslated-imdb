As a young teenager at the time, Airwolf was a compelling sight for a generation that wanted their "cowboys and Indians" to have incredible gadgets and incredible explosions. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was essentially Knight. Rider in the skies: similar comic technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of a man making a difference. <br /> <br /> But in other important ways, it was thematically very different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of the time. On the one hand, the premise of the series is not based on the desire to help the needy, but in the possession of Airwolf by Stringfellow Hawke for essentially selfish reasons (such as leverage to try to find his brother MIA, St John). And then there is the somber advantage provided by firmly grounding the series in a context of the Cold War of the 80s, complete with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the internal enemy. Of course, Team A constantly referred to Vietnam and the status of the team as fugitives, but it was usually done with a light touch and was rarely central to the storyline itself. With Airwolf, intrigue was the key to the tone and direction of the show - although this was (not advisable) diluted with the run of the show. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the Cold War scenario dates clearly from the series. , many of the stories are shocking and thought-provoking, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. But that's not the point. Airwolf was fun, he tried to tell interesting stories without depending only on the great sequences of action, and did not cover everything, miraculously ensuring that no one died. Sometimes it failed, but it often succeeded - and on a TV budget to begin with. <br /> <br /> For UK readers, the DMAX (Sky 155 channel) has just started (January 2008) daily airwolf reruns. Set your Sky + box to this blast from the past - we can even get the fourth season re-shaped, reclassified (and sadly immensely inferior), which, as far as I know, has never been shown previously in the UK.
