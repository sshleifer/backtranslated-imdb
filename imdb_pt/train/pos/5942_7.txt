I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought I had a theatrical feel and that given a chance, Collora could make a great movie. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The plot, or potential story line, was very good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling I would have made a good TV movie or television show. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not as good as a superman. I actually thought he, in his brief appearance, made a decent Clark Kent. Sorry, I do not think of SuperMan as being that amateur. The suit Kent wore masks her size. Batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not the Superman. Supes is undoubtedly toned, but not en masse. Anyway, I did not care about all of her poses and her transformation from Kent to Superman seemed cheeky. Now, this may not just be O'Hearn's fault, Collora may have to give some credit for bad routing and direction. <br /> <br /> Second, the special effects to fly were cheezy. Superman flies across the sky. If it was obvious that this Superman flew close to the ground, with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him. I do not think there have been photos of Superman's entire body flying. Of course, the harness and equipment that support O'Hearn must be located on his lower torso. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a good trailer. I would probably pay to watch a movie if it ever was, and I would watch it on television. The plot, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, the super-envious man of Lois's attraction to Wayne, Lex and Twoface as a team to beat Superman and the merging of forces between Batman and Superman is good. I'm sure that with a bigger budget and approval for a full-length film, Collora and company, even O'Hearn could make a decent movie. Certainly, a better than most comic-based comics coming out of Hollywood lately.
