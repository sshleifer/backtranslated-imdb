2 WORDS: Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, Drama to make me cry and one of the biggest dance scenes to rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The acting was the top of any independent film. Jeremy Earl was in great shape for a long time since going through the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with dynamite precision and shrewd wit seen for the last time in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next appearance of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My bus !! It's .... Gone" This was the true turning point of the film. My grandma loved it so much I bought the DVD and recommended it to her friends. This will bring tears to your eyes and heat to your heart by seeing the white tie of Tony Donato and Nathan Davis. Through thick (being held to knife point) and thin (Nathan giving Tony tips on women), the new dynamic duo has arrived and is out to conquer Hollywood.
