I'm surprised no one thought of making such a movie before. Horror is often more effective when you use real-life dislike as a theme. And no one (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. The torture of the tooth has been done before (see The Marathan Man, for example), but this takes the terror to the suburb. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who descends madness. Now, our dear doctor was not playing with a whole deck, but, driven by jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder, begins to wreak havoc on those around him. The spiral mental condition of the doctors is very close to what we see in Micheal Douglas's character in Falling Down, but with a tone of terror. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, his witty and has a great flow. I also attended a police officer, always welcome Ken Foree. <br /> <br /> Now I believe this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance of Corbin Bernsen. Having really only seen him in LA Law before, I was impressed with his acting. <br /> <br /> The sequel to The Dentist 2 also deserves to be watched, but slightly below average compared to the original. Bottomline TTKK - A fun movie with some scenes that will make you shrink, topped (pun intended) by a great Bernsen performance
