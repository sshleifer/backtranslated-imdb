The riveting drama, scripted by William Mastrosimone based on his play, in which Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, attacked in his car by rapist Joe (James Russo). She is able to escape, but the police report that there is nothing they can do. She realizes, however, that Joe got her wallet and knows where she lives. When her housemates Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are off work, Joe pays him a visit to finish what he started. After Joe humiliates and degrades her in various ways, she has the chance to retaliate and imprison him. Knowing very well that she is in another situation "his word against his" and that no rape occurred technically, she has no intention of taking him until he confesses to Pat and Terry what his intentions were. <br /> <br /> The film amounts to a confrontation between its two opponents. Meanwhile, Marjorie demonstrates such cruelty that one has to wonder if she was not as unbalanced as her enemy. Fawcett does a credit worthy job, while Russo is really excellent as the depraved who does his best to manipulate the situation. With only two characters on screen for much of the runtime, the movie has an intimate nature that suggests it would work even better on the stage. Director Robert M. Young does not shy away from the ugliest and most exploitative elements of the situation; the film becomes uncomfortable to watch at times. And when Marjorie has the edge, things change enough that it is not so easy to encourage her to get blood, and it's hoped Pat can make her see reason. <br /> <br /> Extremities, "I felt, was a very good movie that at least kept interest and a pretty high level of intensity. <br /> <br /> Woodard and Scarwid are well on the stand (Scarwid has a great time when Terry reveals himself victim of rape), and the rhythm is consistent. Granted, the dialogue is not always very strong, but the material is compelling every step of the way.
