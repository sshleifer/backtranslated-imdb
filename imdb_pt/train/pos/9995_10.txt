This is the kind of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, the fire lit and feet up. It does not require much brain power to follow, so it's very good after a long day. I'd say it's very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, then do not bother, but it's very funny. Just the thought that a business man would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while, and then really enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
