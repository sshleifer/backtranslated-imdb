First, someone mentioned here that because it was released in "limited" quantity, it means that it should be bad ... that's exactly what the "big five" Hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they could "go" or " ignore". "to the point, this production has been released" limited "because it is considered" unpatriotic "by certain individuals. <br /> <br /> Now I have loved I think it's much better than "Charlie Wilson's War," even if it's a "fictional" account of something that "never" happens, but it's always so obvious.This holds true for anyone interested or affected by current US foreign policies. "or" on board. " the "Turakistan" and the "Emerald City" are definitely trying to resemble Iraq and Baghdad, just as the "Tamerlane" corporation prefers "haliburton" (with Vice President Dan Aykroyd as Dick Cheney, LOL). Quiet a moment, in fact, where the film is SERIOUS DEAD, nor more sarcastic (the prime example would be how the character of John Cusack deals with his depression, but not just). <br /> <br /> I have found that ALL characters can be related to something / someone or specific stereotypes. now word of advice; If you are not politically active, especially in relation to the "globalization" aspects, you probably will not make the most of it, since most of your content and internal "jokes" target certain "personalities" that are not "visible" to the general audience on a daily basis ... (the main exception would be Hilary Duff, who plays the well-known materialistic pop star, do I need to say the name (S)?). in your CORE the appeal is an anti-globalization show, period. the message is unmistakably delivered with comic revenge. Joan has a line at a point that goes like this: "and here we have a book written by you know who, how I conquered the world and solved problems with my father.") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> sister and brother Cusacks play well together, as always, even in "Grosse PointeBlank" I would say a little more "mature". Marisa Tomeihere does not show her ass and breasts to "impress" us (as she recently did in "Before the devil knows that you're dead "), but instead she plays a very serious role, and manages to make it very easy. <br /> <br /> Many critics do not understand (can not do this, or do not want to). This is not a "regular" movie, but more of a comic book documentary. this feature is to deliver a message and NOT to get the Oscar, or make the "visuals" lead the viewer to buy the latest TV sets "HDTV experience" ... I even noticed in my local newspapers that this film - because it is not "artistic", while the Iraqi PRO war films give a good sign of seemingly "enveloping" balance. It makes us wonder how big the world media is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of guys. .. <br /> <br /> I bet this feature will be a hit abroad as much as in North America. As I mentioned before, it's all a satire on American foreign policy and how it was kidnapped by "special interests" groups ... having the "regular" American soldier wearing the corporate logo "Tamerlane" in their combat dress is very insulting BUT EFFECTIVE in showing reality as it is, or will soon be the way things go so far. <br /> <br /> some shots IMPAGABLE: after the "liberation", the country is invaded by commercial ads; a hilarious scene about how future journalists are likely to gather "news" ("anything should be better than this ox-box"))); soldiers who deal with their "frustration"; <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend this for "conservative" or "hard core" patriots of one kind or another. This feature is not meant to reach people's "minds of souls" (as mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do) instead of containing a well-defined message for the realists, and for some seemingly " always "short of achievement.
