Gung Ho is one of those movies that I never tire of watching. Michael Keaton has always been one of my favorites, and he's absolutely hilarious in this movie. Combining it step by step is Gedde Watanabe. The two work wonderfully together. Although this movie is a comedy, I also like to show how Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) fight in their roles as leaders of their respective groups. They both try so hard to keep the peace, and then they finally get into a fight (which is hysterical to watch). First, both are on the floor. Then Hunt jumps on a chair. Kazihiro leaps on the table. Hunt jumps on the table with him. The fight then leaves the office for the factory. I love that after they are separated by the workers, you can say that they both feel bad for leaving things so out of hand. In addition, there is a scene in which you can see the influence that Hunt had on Kazihiro. He's at his house and his Japanese boss arrives and says he'd like to visit the factory tomorrow: Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: Why not? Kazihiro: The factory is locked and we can not find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can not imagine Michael Keaton saying something like that! <br /> <br /> I think I really like this movie because it's genuinely funny, and it also shows how people who are radically different may not only learn from each other but also become good friends.
