I found this movie very funny because you have a young black comedian (Chris Rock) who dies and is sent back to Earth on a white man's fifties body. He does not realize that his behavior must change and he continues to act as before . He listens to rap music, sings and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man. The real humor in this film was to observe the problem with which this behavior puts him in contact with the black community.
