The comic joke between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots of all time. Powell is probably the mildest detective of the 1930s, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a succession of tiny bells. They are extremely fun to watch, so take the audacity of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy watching it unfold. Eric Blore also has some twists as Powell's butler. Powell's contract with MGM included a clause that allowed him to refuse to be loaned to another studio, but he wanted to work again with Arthur and he liked the script, so he eagerly accepted the task. They had worked together on two 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both from the Philo Vance series.
