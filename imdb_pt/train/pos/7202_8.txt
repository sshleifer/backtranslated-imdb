Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years before), "Deathtrap" was the first time I saw two men kissing passionately on the screen, and frankly I was shocked. I understood this in terms of plot, and this did not really disturb my sensibility (not much), but it was the first time I've seen, at least in a "mainstream" movie. I thought it was a brave move for their time, and I took the courage for them to try, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as Superman. The male bisexuality on the screen may have worked out with "Brokeback," but it is interesting to note this much earlier incarnation.
