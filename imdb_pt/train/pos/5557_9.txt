"A mouse in the house" is a very classic Tom & Jerry cartoon, true to its tradition, but with its own jokes. It's hysterical, hilarious, very funny and fun. Works of art are also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and is trying to catch the mouse too, because "there's only going to be a cat in this house in the morning - and that's the cat that catches the mouse." <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many funny jokes in this cartoon. The funniest thing to me is, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two cats sleeping and says sarcastically, "I'm glad you're enjoying the nap" and that she hopes they're happy because she's not making two cats sigh. Another funny joke is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and hits Butch with a frying pan and Butch does the same trick for Tom. Of course, funnier than that, it's when the real Mammy Two Shoes show up and both of them (donkeys!). Cats think they are seeing each other in disguise of Mammy and then the two attack in the "back" - lol. Of course she gets angry and when she gets mad, she's not someone to move with. But even Jerry does not win this time, because he gets kicked out by her too.
