Along with Darkwing Duck, this is unjustly canceled. Disney has been in decline since Tarzan and we need a show like this to put Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?) The theme song theme is also captivating. Of all the villains, who are all great on their own merits, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo actually sound very much like the excesses of voice in the Jungle Book, which is not a bad thing. In fact, it's quite inspiring! The animation was on-site, and the screenplay was very clever which was severely lacking in animations for years. PLEASE BRING THIS SHOW BACK! 9/10 Bethany Cox
