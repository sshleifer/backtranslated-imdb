It may not be the best movie of 2006, but it was just a movie to excite and think. The Sentinel is a good political suspense film that looks similar or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies, such as In the Line. the Fire and the Manchu Candidate. The basic plot of this movie is similar to other films like this: a plan to kill the president of the United States. Michael Douglas is the Secret Service agent Pete Garrison, who leads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed. Kiefer Sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival with the name of David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin, who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of Breckinridge agent and Oscar winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine. An improvement for this movie could have been more action, as it is considered by some sources an action movie, but one good thing about this movie is instead of just a murder plan to kill the US president, it also concerns to a mole (traitor) in the Secret Service who is leading the president in the wrong direction.
