One of several musicals about leave sailors, is the usual sailor meets the girl, the complications follow, happily organized sort of conspiracy. It advances smoothly, but also creeps into places. The dialogue is not as exaggerated as "Cartola", for example, and Randolph Scott seems out of place. <br /> <br /> There are compensations. He has some of the best songs from Irving Berlin, including 'Let Yourself Go', 'I'm putting all my eggs in a basket' and 'Let's face music and dance'. There's Fred and Ginger who, when they're dancing, take any movie to heavenly heights and do not disappoint here. They do a tap dance, a comical dance and a graceful dance, all in the same movie! Great versatility and art. <br /> <br /> Also has Harriet Hilliard, who is very good in her role. She had a varied career, becoming the most famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she is playing without being sentimental. Your two songs are simply and effectively delivered. She makes a good contrast to Ginger, but you may believe they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> More tightening have made the movie even better. Very good though.
