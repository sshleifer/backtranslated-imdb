This is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home. Old and wise Golden Retriever Shadow, young American Bulldog Chance and Himalayan cat Sassy escape from the ranch and go to the desert to reunite with his family. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993) is a family adventure directed by Duwayne Dunham. It's a remake of a 1963 film. This movie had a sequel three years later. Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to do the Chance narration. Fox has some youthful energy that he brings to the role. Sally Field does a great voice job as Sassy. Donald Ameche is fantastic as Shadow. This was the latter's last film from this veteran actor. Also the visible actors are great. Laura Burnford-Seaver. Robert Hays is Bob Seaver. Justin Thall plays Peter Burnford. Veronica Lauren is Hope Burnford. Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver. Jean Smart plays Kate. It's amazing to see these animals trying to survive in the desert. Let's see Sassy taken by the river. and she seems ag oner. The bear scene is coming off and funny. Chance has no chance with that big bear, hungry. And his encounter with the porcupine looks painful. This is great fun for the whole family.
