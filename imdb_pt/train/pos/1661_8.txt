(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> While historical accuracy may be questionable ... (and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate LOTR .. such things are more easily excused now) I liked the art of it. Although it's not really an art film. It provides some emotionally charged scenes from time to time. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It is very short. and 2. The voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Replayable: 5/10
