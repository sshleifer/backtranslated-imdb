A meteor falls into Crater Lake, the heat of impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch. <br /> <br /> Alright, so the plot is just crap. But despite its obvious low budget, this presents itself as one of the most exciting and fun movies of loose monsters there are. There are also some good moments of humor. In a time filled with monsters called monsters that are no more than ridiculous creations of men in rubber suits or lizards dressed in ruffles and forced to tear apart each other (cheap style of exploration), it is refreshing to discover that Plesiosaurus in this little gem is an excellent stop-motion Harryhausen-style creature. <br /> <br /> A movie hard to find, but worth finding.
