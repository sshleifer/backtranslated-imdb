He submerged himself at work, lay down in writing, and Zandalee misses the attraction between them. Within that enters Johnny, and old friend of Thierry that already were artists in I exile together. But Johnny kept painting and only got a job for the rent. It catches the day as it comes and leaves its destiny to-morrow. There is an instant raw attraction between Zandalee and Johnny, and they come into a case. But Zandalee struggles with her desire to be wanted and her conscience and love for her husband. But none of them, nor Zandalee, nor Johnny, nor Thierry can prevent their relations from getting totally out of control. <br /> <br /> Comments: It's a thriller. But maybe more of a heart thriller than a normal thriller, where it's about life and death and threat of violence. Not that a heart thriller can not take on fatal proportions, but the threat comes from a different angle. And it's not really until the second time in Zandalee until the suspense shows up, and even if the basis for it is released in the first half, I can not really describe the genre as a thriller then. Much more of a romantic drama than anything else, but with the underlying currents of other genres. The developing thriller is there, but it also has more than a little sensual erotic tonality. Because that's what it's all about, which drives the characters and, therefore, the whole story. Wish. The need to have, and the need to be. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's very good, definitely much better than your current rating (4.1) anyway. It takes time, but it grows a good sense of suspense, and it handles very well with the erotic part, with good taste. It's always an integral part of the story; I needed to be there to give the story that it needed weight, and I never felt it was an excuse to show a bare breast or something like that. But unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end, and the end itself seems half-flat, even if, in its own way, it is dramatic. <br /> <br /> The cast is impressive, spearheaded by actors known as Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and very adept at representing the feelings of desire, sometimes subtle, she overcomes both Cage and Reinhold sometimes goes crazy and gets a little rude. Her career later is too thin for the talent she shows in Zandalee, I can only hope it is because of her own choices. Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the film, it's Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> When you're in the good mood this is a very good movie, you could have used another order to get the credit you really deserve. <br /> <br /> 7/10
