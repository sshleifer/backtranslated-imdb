I just loved this show. I watched it from the first time it aired in the late 90s until the last episode. In my honest opinion, it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your kids. Yes, things have changed a bit with Jo since we last saw her in the books, but she's still interesting, with great stories and good lessons. The actress who plays Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a wonderful job as the actor who plays Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). Throughout the series, we can see the development of the novel between Jo and Nick, as well as the stories and daily lessons. children and students learn. I recommend this show to anyone.
