Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian assassin or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers do not agree. In terms of content, this highly enjoyable action movie does not have one; in terms of pure fun, it's fun - it's very melodramatic, violent, pretty brutal, car chases are remarkable. "Arzenta" is an unpretentious film, but very nice, much better than the current Hollywood garbage that gets the same label. It comes from Delon's rather short flirtation with the Italian B cinema of the 1970s. He carefully uses Delon's dour persona, belonging to the bandit gallery he did in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really liked the fact that Delon made this movie, that he played a part in a good Eurocrime movie. <br /> <br /> The result is very good, with a good intro- ductory music. Making the taste felt by the Italians for the film considered as a synthetic work, where musical art plays an important role. In Tony Arzenta / No Way Out, the very attractive Erika Blanc (31 years old in 1973) appears as an unnamed prostitute. Meanwhile, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra, is played by Carla Gravina (a star who practically left the cinema after 75). <br /> <br /> Interesting "Arzenta" is filmed an ambitious visual conception, some peculiar Expressionist angles. The film was directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari, that also made Zorro (the comedy of Delon). It is undeniable to mention that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very different. The first is a violent bloody and melodramatic. action movie - the second is a cheerful comedy, more like a parody, though remarkably coherent and cleverly done. Duccio Tessari directed films like Kiss Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Sons of Satan, Blood Stained Butterfly, Long Live Death ... Yours! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
