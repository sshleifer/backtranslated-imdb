No prize show can appeal to all people. Clearly, if your favorite movies do not win, you'll say the show was not very good. This is understandable. <br /> <br /> However, the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for a magical moment in Hollywood history: <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's first appearance at the Oscars. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Allen often rejects the awards as being self-titled and meaningless, and never attended - although he has won several of the coveted awards. <br /> <br /> When the 74th Oscar was held, the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York. When it came time to pay homage to New York City, they decided to show a video of the highlights of the city movie. Then the announcer simply said: "Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar-winning director Woody Allen." <br /> <br /> The venue began on an extremely long standing ovation. The entertainment industry finally gave its applause to the New York man, who generally avoids the Hollywood scene. When the applause ceased, Woody applied part of his legendary wit to the situation. <br /> <br /> SOME HIGHLIGHTS: <br/> <br/> "Thank you so much - this makes up for the search for cops." <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted their Oscars back "he teased. "I panicked because the pawn shop was out of the market for a long time and I had no way to recover anything." <br /> <br /> "But it was not that, I could not understand why my movie was not nominated for anything this year, so it occurred to me - maybe they were calling to apologize." Allen also revealed why he had neglected his aversion to the Oscars for this special night. "For New York, I would do anything. So I got my tux and came over here," Allen said. <br /> <br /> "It's a great, great movie town. It's been a great, moving, and exciting setting for movies, and it's still a great city." <br /> <br />
