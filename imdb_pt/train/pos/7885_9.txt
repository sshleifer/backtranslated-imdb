First of all, I have to start this comment by saying that I am a big fan of Nightmare on Elm Street. I think it's the greatest horror series of all time. For me, Freddy is the bogeyman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, which tried to be the last chapter of the era, is a strange movie. It does not have the same atmosphere as the previous films. Freddy has a lot of time on the screen. Some find that makes it less scary, which I agree with. And that is, in my opinion, exactly the point. This movie exists so we can get to know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he was, how he became the man haunting our dreams. For some people, it is a bad thing, it is better if we never know why it is more frightening not to know why evil is evil. Obviously, these people will not like Rob Zombie's Halloween remake. To really enjoy this, you have to see things differently. It's not about a strange guy hiding in the jungle of your dreamland hoping to scare you. This was the first, and it was amazing. Over the years, Freddy killed more and more people, and no one could get rid of him forever. Now it's time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's reign of terror. In addition to the story of Freddy's past, I also really enjoyed the atmosphere of the movie. No more kids in Springwood, just crazy adults. The nightmare scenes are all great. The soundtrack is incredible, especially the opening song called "I'm Awake Now", presented by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can not believe it's so underrated. Maybe it's misunderstood or I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch. There are many scary moments, as well as funny moments, and many apparitions! Get ready for something different and you will not be disappointed.
