There have been a number of recent surfing movies that I seem to find without warning. I got this treasure in digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! The focus is on the pioneers of 60's big wave surfing, Greg Noll, our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks and Jaws. Hell, I could watch a movie just about Laird Hamilton - one of the great athletes of this generation - so the rest is just gravy. There is a lot of good surfing mixed with interviews of stars from the past and the present, in a nice, relaxed and unpretentious way. Of all the surf movies I've seen, the big wave story is the best, and I think it's my favorite. Appreciate!
