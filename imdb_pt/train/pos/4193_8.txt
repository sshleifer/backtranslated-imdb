Director Sam Fuller has a kind of cult, particularly in Europe. However, most of his films are more than forgettable. However, he directed a really fantastic film in "Pickup on South Street". Made very early in his career, the films that followed were much lower. From the first to the last frame, the "Pickup" works on all levels. It is filmed with flawless fluidity, boasting great performances at all times. Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with an excellent record of top performances are at their peak. Widmark, who was not weird in playing villains, while really important to the core, still manages to reveal only the lightest humanity that makes his character fascinating as well as make Jean Peters' character fall in love with him more credibly . <br /> <br /> Fuller does not hold punches in this genuinely difficult film. There's a scene where Jean Peters is assaulted by Widmark. It is truly shocking in your reality. This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography. <br /> <br /> Less self-conscious than many noir films of the period, this remains a great example of the genre.
