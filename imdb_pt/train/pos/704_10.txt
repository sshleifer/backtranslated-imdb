This film, with a budget as low as possible, is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. If you accept that it is a low budget from the beginning, you can appreciate how good the story is, how well written the script is and how great the filmmaker has produced something so wonderful with so little money. <Br /> <br /> All the elements of a great movie are here. The visuals, though digitally recorded, were beautiful in some places. The bizarre and dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well on the scene with the talking dog, that scene was simply amazing. It's a job so rampant, but not done pretentiously, and because of that I have a lot of respect for this movie. It is highly recommended for anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and unlike many of the repetitive films out there.
