We showed this film at the local Film Society, and the art house audience had the time of their cinematic lives. It's tasteless, groovy and very funny in a kind of sixties. The sketch of Kraft Kitchen's recipe made them laugh like maniacs. The rest is a mixed bag, but the highs definitely exceed the minimums. By the way, what happened to Ken Shapiro?
