I remember the original series vividly mainly due to its unique blend of ironic humor and macabre subject matter. Kolchak was a tough journalist at Ben Hecht's school of big-city reporting, and his determination and wise behavior made the most mundane episode eminently watchable. My personal favorite was "The Spanish Mosses Murders" because of its totally original plot. A poor and troubled young cajun from the Louisiana country participates in a sleep research experiment for the purpose of dream analysis. Something goes inexplicably wrong, and he literally dreams of living a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth. This malevolent manifestation seeks out all the people who deceived the dreamer into his conscious state and brutally suffocates them to death. Kolchak investigates and discovers this horrible truth, to the chagrin of police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (wonderfully rehearsed by Keenan Wynn grumpy) and sleep researcher of Second City founder Severn Darden, to understated perfection. . The frighteningly entertaining and distressing ending occurs in Chicago's sewer system and is a highlight of the series. Kolchak has never improved. Eternal.
