I first saw a track of this DVD on a hi-fi show in November 2006 in London (I was not really into cream so far !!) It was through a high end Arcam system, which sounded pretty good with dts. and I'll tell you that this is by far the most exciting music DVD I've ever watched. The performance of Cream at its age was just mind-boggling and the sound quality is the best I've heard on a music DVD. kind of music you like, this will definitely grow on you. It's the brilliance of your performance that will make you watch again and again. Even new musicians do not cut mustard these days, as do these old rockers.
