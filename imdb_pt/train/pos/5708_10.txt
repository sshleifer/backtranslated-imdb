This is so exciting! After I saw "La Roue" this afternoon, a little light-hearted movie, I consider this a real treat! This is absolutely delicious and one of the most enchanting images I have seen this year. It's most surprising since it's an early talkie and puts some great 1930's pictures to shame because of its innovative use of sound in the cinema. It is simply full of music and a lovely mood that is really optimistic and ultimately made me happy! Obviously, it would not be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket that the male was looking for, but the pace is so stimulating and the film is so spectacularly entertaining that I did not even think about it twice. The comedy is often hilarious and I think it is even superior to the Marx Brothers, possibly the greatest comic force of the time. This is perfect.
