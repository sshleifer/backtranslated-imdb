The master of the cinematographic spectacle Cecil B. De Mille goes to the west. Using three legends of the old West as their protagonists (they probably never met), Gary Cooper is playing Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur makes a good Calamity Jane. The story only serves for De Mille to hang some wonderful action sequences, such as the great Indian attack. Scenarios like this are extremely well done. If you do not mind the rather exaggerated performances of the cast, this is a fun Western Quake look at a very young Anthony Quinn rehearsing the role of a brave Indian who participated in the battle of Little Big Horn. This part gave him by least noticed in Hollywood.
