I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort by Whoopi Goldberg. Beyond it, there are no other stars in the film and its role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. As I work in a high school with urban children, I think this is an important film to show the South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a film about education and relationship of a teacher with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for practically nothing on a videostore. I watched and quickly stepped through the musical numbers. But I strongly recommend this movie to educators and their students to understand. Now while I do not know the other actors and actresses in the movie, I assume they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad they filmed with a South African cast and crew, with the exception of Goldberg in a small role, but if that makes people see this movie, then Whoopi reaches the world appeal.
