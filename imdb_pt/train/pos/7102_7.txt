Other users here seem to think this is a horrible movie. This is simply not true and a little unfair. <br /> <br /> The acting is of good quality and the direction goes forward with a decent fluency. I do not think there's anything wrong with the Tarantino-esquire way of putting stories together. Maybe it's just a new tool for the directors to try. I thought this made the film a lot more interesting. Maybe some elements of the script need to be reduced, but that's the only flaw I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives a great performance as Sylvio, also Antonella Rios is amazing and worth the price of admission alone.
