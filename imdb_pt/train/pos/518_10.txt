Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the USA. During World War II, British aircraft Peter Carter (David Niven) is shot down in combat, but he survives. He meets and falls in love with the lovely June (Kim Hunter). But it seems that a mistake was made in heaven - he should have died! A French spirit comes to fetch him, but he refuses. He is about to defend his case in front of a Heavenly Court that he should be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> It sounds ridiculous, but this is really an amazing movie. The script is good, with the actors playing the roles completely forward and wonderfully directed - the scenes on Earth are in breathtaking technicolor (I've never seen a beautiful blue sky) and the scenes in Heaven are in black and white. White! Niven is a little rough at times but Hunter is great (and very handsome) and Roger Livesey is great as a doctor trying to help Niven. The images are amazing (especially the ladder and during the final sequence of the trial) and the special effects are truly great (considering the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven comes across a naked naked boy grazing sheep! This is an absolutely beautiful and thought-provoking film - highly recommended. This remains unknown in the US, which is a shame.
