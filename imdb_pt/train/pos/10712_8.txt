This movie is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton's movie). But it's a less glamorous tale and more with you. And of course here is not the father, but his grandfather tells the stories. <br /> <br /> The narrative of the film also moves back and forth (so the story summary here on IMDb can tell you more than you'd like to read before watching the movie). It's funny and engaging enough, even if you move from one story to another and have dramatic moments as well. It also surprises you here and there with things you would not expect. A good little movie, then, that deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that! : O)
