You know, this movie is not great, but, I mean, come on, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find the plot hilarious anyway, this kid's father says he'll take him back if the angels get the pennant (because he knows they will not) Kid prays to his false god to help the angels win, God helps all the time (through the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his father does not take him back and leaves on his motorcycle in the face of children. It's hilarious until Danny Glover adopts you and be friends. <br /> <br /> I think the advantage is that the old lady is left alone to die with her sewing projects and her stories. The real winner here, however, is God. Because he later got a job as a writer for numerous play games. As a children's movie, it gains a 7. Like a movie about the mysteries of blind and stupid faith, and the nature of the "god" gets a 10.
