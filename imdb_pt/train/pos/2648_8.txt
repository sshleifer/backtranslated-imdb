Really the tale of two arrogant brothers and their respective falls of grace (via drug addiction) and subsequent redemption. A brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco, is his typical sensitive but intelligent man. The other brother is a future doctor who works hard and who becomes less critical because he himself is a victim of addiction while dealing with the stress of living according to the expectations of his family for both children. Not too heavy as drug fables are want to be, and all in all a pretty realistic outline of the family dynamics that cause drug problems. I would recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and would praise James Franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love.
