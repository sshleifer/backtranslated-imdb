Sandwiched between San Francisco and Captains Courageous two of the biggest parts of Spencer Tracy is this very curious movie about the war and the effects it has on some people. They gave him a gun stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone in the only movie they did together and Gladys George as the woman who loves them both. Tracy and Tom are a couple of members of World War I, Tom is a weak character who almost goes over the hill on the training ground, but Tracy stops him. Tracy is still playing the lovely kind of Wallace Beery, whom MGM imagined for him when they hired him to leave Fox. <br /> <br /> In the lead, Tom gets an opportunity and catches him when, during a fight, he manages to get to a church tower that sits in a nest of German machine guns. He learned to shoot now and does a York sergeant. But Alvin C. York has never been altered by the war as Tom has. <br /> <br /> Injured in the fight Tone convalesces in a hospital with Gladys George taking care of him. Tracy will AWOL if he visits his friend and he and George do something. Later, when Tracy is reported missing in action, Tone and George get married. Tracy is heartbroken when he comes back and learns about marriage, but sits in a stride. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is dealing with Tom applying the war skills he learned from the gangster trade. He is a successful man now and George really does not know what he does to live. I think you can figure out the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that gave me some problems is that I can not believe Gladys George could not figure it out. She is a smart girl on the street, her part is very much like the one she played in The Roaring Twenties opposite James Cagney. Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, the development of Humphrey Bogart's character is similar to that of Tone. not the central character of the movie. In fact, there are elements of They gave you a weapon that can be found in Taxi Driver and Clint Eastwood's classic, The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The sequences of World War I battles are very well staged by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin criticized this film, I think it is much better than he gave credit.
