As one of the previous commentators said, this had the foundations of a great movie, but something happened on the way to delivery. A waste, because Collette's performance was odd and Williams was believable. I just kept hoping it would get better. I do not think it was a bad edit or needed another director, it could have been just the movie. It appeared like a Canadian movie, something like the first X-Files seasons. It's not cheap, just mushy. Besides, I needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump out of place. The film arrived at that moment and disappeared; like a false climax. I can see how being very suspense would have taken away the "reality" of the story, but I thought that part was achieved when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie needs to have a director cut that tries to fix those issues.
