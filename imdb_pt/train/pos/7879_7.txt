As with most of Eleanor Powell's films, it unfolds along the most fragile plots. For some reason - ah, that's explained! It is selected to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good and evil compete for the mine and who is who gets confused. But, as always, Powell's dance is superb and worth the price of admission. And in this, Lahr plays her cowardly lion, evoking hot memories of the 1939 Technicolor movie. An irrelevant benefit is to hear a young Frank, with that wonderful voice and skinny vulnerability that he abandoned to his wise personality later. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has fun showing off his virtuosity. Especially note his unique duet with Dorsey's trumpet man, Ziggy Elman. I say "single," perhaps in ignorance, but I do not know of any other drum / trumpet sequence like that in movies or records. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's goofy person is relatively restrained. Powell again shows that she is the greatest film dancer of all time.
