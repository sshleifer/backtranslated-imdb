This movie is much better than the original The Jerk. I recommend it to anyone who likes quirky humor. We've incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime speech as we have from Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The card game with the hobos and then with Mr. Suicide. The scene at the dinner table and his disgust for tortoise soup. The original Jerk was very choreographed and staged. While I like Steve Martin, he seemed to be trying hard. Jerk Too is a parody and will be enjoyed by anyone. Jerk Too is familiar as opposed to the original The Jerk.
