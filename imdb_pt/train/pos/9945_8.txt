First things first! This is not an action movie, although there is a lot of action in it! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable, winning a game or tournament beyond expectations! In this case it is not about football or baseball, but Taekwondo! At first these street thugs seem to be good for nothing! But we'll soon discover that they do not want to be bad guys and really get something in life! It's good to see them fight and train! I was surprised at how funny this movie was! From the beginning to the end you will laugh at your pants! The young Korean actors are very convincing! Go see this wonderful movie feel good!
