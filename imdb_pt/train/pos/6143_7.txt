I've never seen this 1971 movie and was greatly entertained by this great production created by Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played a prominent role as a woman who had taken a witchcraft course and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broom and had several difficulties to take off. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed trip to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed her final exams to become a talented witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this course of witchcraft and he tries to help her in every possible way to find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose for his madness and that is to prevent the Nazis from avoiding England. Great family entertainment and we need more movies like this today.
