I believe this is the most powerful movie that HBO Pictures has done to date. This movie should have been released in theaters for the public to see on the big screen. It's available on video, so check it out and check it out. Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and script. The performances of Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are impeccable. A masterpiece of the genre.
