I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just referring to the breathtaking scenario. It's about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take some time out of their not-so-happy domestic lives. In the end, four women collect the place together, all with different personalities and different reasons to be there. In this magically beautiful place, everyone finds the peace for which they crave, and curiously, peace comes from inner reflections and resolutions, more than without. I also find it wonderful because of relationships that are developed kindness and understanding. The acting is a joy to watch in itself. I particularly love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
