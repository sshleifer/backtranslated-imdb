Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, maybe Dumbland to anyone except Lynch and that's what makes it funny and a collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Profanity? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful picture of some Americans who have no brain and beat wife and kids for fun. From Mexico I can say I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth are bleeding, all the noise around and the violence makes me want to scream and put me behind my bed. 2- Keep the stick! Yes baby, take and learn a lesson: some people will never be grateful for their actions. 3- ants. The most Lynch episode of all, music, surrealism and a very sweet revenge ...
