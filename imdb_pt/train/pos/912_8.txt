This film brings back many memories of the classic cinema of yesteryear, where the actors did not have to undress to make the spectators watch the film. <br /> <br /> First, I think the main positive point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between Shahid and Amrita, it's definitely the production of the movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen many comments about the film being sickly and overly muddy. In response to this, I think to some extent this is a correct analysis, however, considering that this is a Barjatya film, I think compared to MPK, HAHK, HSSH and MPKDH, it has been significantly reduced. HSSH was almost unbearable to watch in some places. <br /> <br /> In this film, however, when the sentimental moments appear, you see yourself smiling, wishing the best couple and hoping that nothing bad happens to them. <br /> <br /> Another great plus point is the performances of Shahid and Amrita. Both acted very well, especially Shahid, who looks great in the movie. Amrita looks simply stunning and must be taken seriously as a great star in the future. <br /> <br /> Although I really liked the movie as a whole, I feel it was too long. Some of the medium could have been trimmed and this could have caused even more impact. I also think the song, although it fits the movie when you see the situations, is a bit old-fashioned and the movie could have benefited if a more up-to-date soundtrack was available. Although the portrayal of the songs Mujhe Haq Hain and Hamari Shaadi Mein are wonderful. <br /> <br /> After all, I definitely recommend this movie, it's romantic, it has an impressive appearance and it has a dramatic climax (I will not go into detail in case you have not seen it. <br /> <br /> PS: If you're prone to cry, get a tissue (I needed several)
