I admit I'm not so in love with Oliver! as a small child - is long, and the story is a bit slow because of all the musical numbers. As a teenager, I discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself. Instead of thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as a celebration of classical history. The adaptation is loose at best, but in fact, if you're watching a musical, you're not there for the story. <br /> <br /> Music is the core of this film, and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy. Most or all of the cast was involved in the theatrical version of the musical, and that shows in their performances - and I consider that an advantage. The performances are all in a more "theatrical" style of acting typical of much older films, and are a lot of fun. The exception is the kid who plays Oliver, whose work seemed to be beautiful and stay out of the way of real artists. <br /> <br /> Fagin and the Dodger are the true stars of the film. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating onscreen presence like the menacing Bill Sykes. Even the Bullseye dog from Sykes does a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate music will despise it, as do those who take musicals very seriously. Nitrating over flawed historical details or confusing the exaggerated performance of the stage type by bad acting will ruin the pleasure of anyone. Just relax and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember that, like a musical, it's a vaguely organized fantasy around the book, not a rigorous adaptation.
