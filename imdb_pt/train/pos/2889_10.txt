*** You may not consider this to have a spoiler, but I'd rather be cautious than careless *** I've never seen this movie when I was little. I fell in love the first time I saw her with my three-year-old daughter. I can watch this again and again. <br /> <br /> For Ilene Woods' little performance in her life, she was a wonderful voice to Cinderella; very interesting; very believable. The song really fits perfectly into the movie. The acting was great; Loved the mice !! You really "hated" Lady Tremain and the foster sisters; they were terrible. The cartoonists described the spoiled behavior very well. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie, especially if you like love stories. My daughter watched the movie about 25 times and still gets excited in the end.
