I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love watching together. It teaches good old fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (albeit with a somewhat predictable story most of the time). It's also a lot of fun to make fun of ... you know, rewind and insert your own dialogue instead of the actors. <br /> <br /> I got my DVR ready to record all the episodes and it happened that I picked up the end of one episode (shortly before the next match ... so I do not know what episode it was), but there was one Sequencing error absolutely TERRIBLE! Adam handed Sheriff Coffee a small sample of "leather," which was ripped from some robber's coat while he tried to escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy happened to have the jacket, so he put it on the table and put the sample exactly from where it had been torn. The sample was EXACTLY rectangular ... which I think would be almost impossible to rip from a piece of leather (post-1950's Naugahyde? Yes. Leather? I do not think so). Well, the sample fitted perfectly and the mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> Not 10 seconds later, we see the coat again, still at Roy's desk. But this time the sample is more like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a COMPLETELY different place in the jacket (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the jacket) and the seam (which was right in the middle of the swatch) now disappeared ... as is the seam in the coat. My daughter enjoyed a good laugh as we played the short scene over and over and over again! It's paramount for youtube, I tell you! <br /> <br /> We still totally love the show, and sequencing errors make it so much fun!
