Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two San Dimas rogues who are sent on another journey of their life as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite of what was presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between Heaven and Hell and ends up being both. When they find the Grim Reaper, they have a chance to an afterlife to throw it for a chance to come back and prevent two evil robots from ruining the future they should have. In addition to playing roles that they ... er ... perfected, they also play (and revive some extra sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original copy of Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason I liked this movie more than the original is because it deals with "how could it be" instead of "what it was". Without ruining the film, I can not give more information about this (I think you just have to watch both of them and decide for yourself!) 8 out of 10 stars.
