Although this film has a list of excellent actors, excellent special effects and a plot full of surprises, it was not chosen for studio distribution and went directly to the DVD. Maybe it contains a lot of "anti-police" information, or maybe it's an over-the-top action movie released during an excess, but whatever the big screen missed the opportunity, fortunately the new concept of direct DVD release allows us <br /> <br /> The theme is old: the novice reporter discovers an inner circle of corrupt cops - in this case the FRAT (First Assault and Tactical Response) team, a group of well-trained police officers bred to clean up the mythical city of Edison from his low point of crime, drugs, prostitution, etc. Working disguised as a temptation to pockete confiscated property and money proves too much of an opportunity and now, 15 years after its formation, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, terrorizing innocent people, etc. The main dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terribly real gangster!) And his partner Rafe Deed (LL Legal J, still hotter than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor). Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) detects a "bad mistake" and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to the head of his newspaper, Ashford (Morgan Morgan, always trustworthy). Gradually, Polack convinces Ashford and later Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also an excellent character actor) and help Pollack in this investigative report. The closer Pollack comes to the truth, the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story takes the mall to a series of unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake does not have the charisma to lead, especially in the company of such artists. experienced actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott keep the well-oiled machine from a movie rolling to the end. No, it's not a great movie, but it's a movie that makes an action movie edge with a message.
