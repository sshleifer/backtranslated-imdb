Not knowing this movie before seeing it on the Rialto Channel, I discovered that it is a nice, pungent and enriching movie. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a little overdone in some places (but this is a movie). The way it looked and the fun ride that the main character took until he turned evil, as real life can and does. Yeah, I thought Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested in watching this movie once it started because people often play about their acting skills (I find this very strange because she is always a solid actress in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I loved the part in the end, where Andy's character said "sometimes I feel like he's never been here" etc., it was as completely as it really is in a situation like that (with the which I personally identify myself with), then there was that beautiful classic piece "Nocturne". I think by Chopin, it was a nice way to end (bar the light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I say "well done" to the filmmakers - I've seen 1,000s of movies worse!
