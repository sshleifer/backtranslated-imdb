Definitely one of the most witty and twisted I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and kept me up all the time. <br /> <br /> Very elegant pieces and props really give a sense of atmosphere to the process. The minimalist feel works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not with the movie itself, but with the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the DVD movie. I own the fullscreen version (which proves that I love the movie enough to support the full-screen presentation), but an incredible Deluxe or 'special' edition would surely bring my money.
