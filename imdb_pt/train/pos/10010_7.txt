There are many diseases born in the mind of man that have been given life in modern times. Constant vigilance or information accumulated in the kingdom of Pyschosis, have kept psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last for decades. Occasionally, some of these mental phenomena are discovered by those who are unaware of its remedy or even of its existence. This is the premise of the movie entitled "The Night Listner". He tells the story of a popular radio host named Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends his nights haunting his audience with vivid stories about gay lifestyles. Maybe it's because his show is losing his authentic veneer that makes Noon admit that he's not himself anymore. Feeling abandoned by his boyfriend Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), he seeks shelter in his deep despair and isolation. It's here, a mysterious voice in the night calls for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches the desperate voice that belongs to a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). By reading the boy's harrowing manuscript, which portrays the onset of life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents, Noon is captivated and wants to help. However, things are not what they seem and noon soon finds itself wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale plucked from a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and if it were not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, this may be comical. Instead, this may be one of William's most serious performances. ***
