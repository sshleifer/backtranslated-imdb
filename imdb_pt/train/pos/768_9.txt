Cinematically, this movie smells bad. The same happens with a lot of acting. But I do not care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80's were (for many of us in the interior anyway) and that hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> nation and break dancing were really like. Great music, great < Dancing! It seems almost a documentary of a time now past when hip-hop was a lifestyle. It's also interesting to see New York looking like the ground zero of a nuclear strike. Some viewers may be too young to remember that it was a poor and run down town during the 1970s and 1980s. This is the best of all the hip-hop / break dance films that came out of this period. Of course, 80's are considered a joke now, with all the bad tv shows and movies, but those of us who have lived will always remember that. > <It was fond of a time when music, dance and graffiti were cool, yo!
