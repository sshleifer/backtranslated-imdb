This is one of those unique horror movies that requires a much more mature understanding of the word 'horror' for it to be appreciated. The main thing people fail to realize is that this story is told from a boy's point of view and, as with most young children, it scares easily. Mainly because he just does not understand things, like why his father is almost never there for him. By watching the movie, you can see the husband discussing with his wife the balance between work and family time, and you can understand it easily, but the boy does not. One can also imagine the boy being afraid of the woods, as is established at the beginning of the film, that the family is from the city. Also, at the outset, when the family is traveling home, they hit a deer, then get stuck, then argue with the villagers about it, and the little boy certainly did not find that introduction in the woods pleasant. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is ultimately what your innocent, young mind makes to explain it all. There is the legend of the American Indian, but when one looks at the scene in which the boy hears about it, it is explained to him as bluntly and simplistically. Not because it's what Wendigo really is, but because that's how he understands. When you look at the movie from this point of view, you can really start to appreciate it. Obviously, it was low budget and fired at low prices, but jumping mounts, the use of light and the lack of general brightness compensated for this. And the last question the movie asks is: Is it all in your head, or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: Profanity, violence and a sex scene
