I've always liked Johnny Concho and would like this movie to be on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this. <br /> <br /> When we meet Frank in the lead role of the film, he is the brother of a notorious gunman out of town at the moment. The brother feels terror in the heart of the city and Frank takes the maximum advantage of it to intimidate the people of the city in safety. Only Phyllis Kirk has any feelings for him. She is the daughter of store owner Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other gunmen arrive at William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it happens that Conrad has killed Sinatra's brother and he is coming to his city to take control. They humiliate Sinatra and drive him out of town. Kirk follows. <br /> <br /> During the night Sinatra passes from punk to the coward and becomes a man in search of some kind of backbone. It's a well-represented performance, almost as good as his Oscar-nominated role in The Man With A Golden Arm. Too bad that for some reason this has not been seen for years. <br /> <br /> Two other prominent performances are Keenan Wynn as a former gunslinger who became a preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to face Conrad and Dark. And then there's Conrad in what I believe to be his on-screen career role. He is a villain of incredible malevolence, pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> However what I like about Johnny Concho is the unforgettable climax where Conrad and Dark are treated. Let's just say that I believe Johnny Concho was MGM's response to High Noon and a primer to what you do when evil causes a breakdown in all law and order.
