This movie was great, a little scary, but great at it. For those of you who have heard of columbine and know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. In the back of your mind, you know people think about these things, but you never realize how bad it is, and this movie makes you realize. It feels so good. It also makes you think twice before making fun of someone you know for sure. I read a book about the columbine massacre and it made me think, this movie makes me worried and scares me to death. On the down side it's like killing a guide to serial killers. Recently I received a threat, and I ended up losing my reasoning, but after that movie, I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never really know what they are, so take it seriously and do not underestimate someone.
