This is an extremely long movie, which means you can become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its duration provides an opportunity for your characters to find permanent attachment to their sympathies. <br /> <br /> If you are moved by the guilt of the disgusting you will find it particularly distressing because it is a story that finds its heroes between the bad and the weak. If you can love a monster, you will cry for Magnus Pym, the spy who betrays everyone - notably his country, his friends and family - a man who has also been manipulated and shaped since childhood by these same people. <br /> <There is not a truly agreeable character throughout history, nor a loyal, 'moral' personality to sympathize with. But watching the whole thing without the help of a fabric would be quite remarkable. <br /> <br /> I really liked that in the end. It pays off for people who like incisive movies about more basic human characters.
