I'll give it to you straight away ... this movie is incredible. Foreign gay movies are so fast surpassing American gay movies in production quality and history. while so many American indie-gay movies are grainy, bad sound, amateur acting, trivial stories and a surprising lack of nudity or erotic, high-quality foreign gay movies have come out like this from France. cinematography is beautiful, thoughtful, meaningful. the story is adult and complex (but not difficult for anyone to follow), the acting is intense and professional. both clues are fantastic as are the entire cast. the boys are more than just cute and there's plenty of full frontal nudity. You follow the whole year of these boys, from the meeting to the end. all the little nuances of a relationship, the details of getting in and out of love are beautifully accomplished. It left me wanting more. Check out!
