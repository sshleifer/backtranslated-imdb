I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger performed above average, I think the sets were representative of the venue and the season, I liked the soundtrack and the band Charlie Daniels. However, I think the photography was amazing! Once the inner scenes were filmed in the royal club and Gilley's had low ceilings - perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that supposedly simulated a "smoke-filled bar" hung six feet below the ceiling. The camera was able to take photos through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dance, the low level of light that really was in the bar! What a feat! Of course there was auxiliary lighting, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be a dim light. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was excellent! He got some photos he had no hope of getting and their impact brought a sense of reality to the film. Thank you, Ray - great job!
