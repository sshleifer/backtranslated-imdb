Gandhi, my father, is like seeing a book, chapter by chapter, you read it (with your eyes) and learn more about Harilal Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. Little is known about both and this movie describes them in a unique way. The title fools, however, is a film about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya do full justice to their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Such films are like leap years. They come after all this time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, my father, also speaks of an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any struggle for freedom ever achieved. <br /> <br /> Watch, if you like quality movies.
