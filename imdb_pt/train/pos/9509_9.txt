Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really do not know why everyone says they have a slow pace. I thought the rhythm was perfect. The film is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks to perfection, who is a killer type who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He does not like this job, but does so because Rooney paid for his home and helps financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But, his children do not know that this is his job, and when someone witnesses a cold-blooded murder for him, he is placed in an uncomfortable position. And when an atrocity occurs, he goes out with his son and is willing to take revenge. They steal jobs and more and build a bond. They are the perfect team. Hanks does a great job as always, as does Jude Law, who plays her chilling role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and shows a lot how the 1930's were.
