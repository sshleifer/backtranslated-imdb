I had not seen this movie since the late 80's and decided to take the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance movie. Music, hip hop / freestyle artists and breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. Breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "Breakin '," but I have to say that "Breakin' 1 & 2" takes the energy and excitement to the screen much better. It's a movie I'm going to keep in my library, but it's not a movie I can watch over and over, just once on a blue moon.
