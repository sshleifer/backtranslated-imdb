I am a man, not given to women's movies, but this is really a special story well done. I do not have personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does a great job while DeNiro is her always-on self. Everything is so well done: acting, direction, visual, settings, photography, cast. If you can enjoy a history of real people and real love - this is a winner.
