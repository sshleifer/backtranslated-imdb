Theodore Rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression !! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece, Jonathan R. Betuel aligns with the great 20th century filmmakers such as Francis Ford Copola, Martin Scorcese, Orson Welles and Roman Polanski. The special effects are nothing short of breathtaking and make any work of Spielberg seem banal and elemental. At the time of its release, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary jewel that it raised the level of film production to levels never anticipated by the filmmakers. The concept of doing not just a movie with a dinosaur, but adapting an action-packed detective novel, exciting, co-staring a dinosaur "talking" with a postmodern name like "Theodore", and an existential female police officer changed the humanity as we know it. The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty. Watching Theodore Rex is much like looking at the face of God and hearing him say "you are my most beloved creation". This is one of the few movies that is simply DYING !!!
