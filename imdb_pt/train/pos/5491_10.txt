Even if we know how the story ends, this is an exciting film that plays almost like a political thriller. During the calm before the storm, we met Hugo Ch치vez as a charismatic man, bigger than life, who has an unbreakable connection with the mestizos that make up 80% of the population, but who were previously excluded from Venezuela's political process and its wealth in oil. He seems as dedicated to them as they are to him. He travels the country at a frenetic pace, reaching out to the peasants, addressing large crowds, hugging and kissing ordinary people, accepting letters on scraps of paper, and hearing requests for help. People are excited that one of them has reached the highest office in the country. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that change for the better is coming to suppurated neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. The Spanish-speaking Castilian elite of pure blood, which is a small minority, but previously controlled all wealth, is full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most unintentionally hilarious moments of the film is when a look-alike Ann Coulter, in a meeting of residents in an exclusive closed condominium, complains of the mestizos, "they have no notion of struggle or sacrifice." Minutes later, a speaker tells the meeting that "be careful of your domestic servants - they could be supporters of Chavez." Duh! Of course they are. <br /> <br /> In a late-night interview alone with the film crew, Chavez reveals something of his soul as he tells the story of his grandfather. He may be a sensitive, poetic person, albeit with a mischievous, even clownish sense of humor (as we saw when he addressed the UN and called Bush a devil). <br /> <br /> Then the storm begins to gather. force when organizers of the coup call for a mass protest and cynically manipulate their supporters to change the route at the last minute and marching in the presidential palace, knowing that he is surrounded by Chavez's supporters and that violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot fits when snipers begin firing on Chavez supporters, some of whom shoot back. The local equivalent of Fox News shows this return and claims that Chavez's supporters are massacring the demonstrators. Then the camera turns away and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protesters took a different path. Needless to say, the filming of the empty street was edited by private anti-Ch치vez TV stations (which had been broadcasting a constant wave of propaganda calling Mr. Ch치vez mentally sick and sexually attached to Fidel Castro.) Immediately after the coup, we see the leaders and their media propaganda masters bragging about TV about how they manipulated the situation with careless indifference to the lives of sympathizers and opponents. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers remain at the center of this chaos, a rapidly changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bombard it. Chavez ends up surrendering to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to resign and is taken to an island where an airplane waits to take him - where? The USA? How can remaining cabinet members avoid the arrest and defeat of this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and ultra-wealthy businessmen who are intimately connected to the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If your only knowledge of Hugo Ch치vez and Venezuela is from the US media, then you know nothing. He is not an "unelected tyrant" and does not "rule by decree" - he is enormously popular, having been elected and re-elected several times with more than 60% of the votes (something George Bush Junior has never achieved) and devotion he inspires in the ordinary Venezuelan people is, ultimately, the reason why the coup fails. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The filmmakers' ability is to be discreet and let history unfold through the voices of Venezuelans at every level, from the neighborhood to the presidential palace, the tumultuous scenes, the chaos and confusion from which a coherent whole emerges that is tense, fascinating and in motion. To not lose!
