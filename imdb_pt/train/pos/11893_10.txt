The two subsequent seasons of this original series were less than dull. The last disastrous seasons of remodeling have contributed to its short duration of three seasons. Maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season, it would have won a follower cult. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first season was really hilarious! Witty, clever with excellent writing was promising. The excellent drink of the first season had the right ingredients - characters / actors, plot and so on. In addition, a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original. Nora and her fellow "photographers" lurking, night after night, day after day for the exclusive. <br /> <br /> Many things do not make sense to me. I like this show, and another of my favors - Gross Pointe has never "done". If only the first seasons of Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, please, anyone out there ?!
