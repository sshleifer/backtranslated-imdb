This is one of my favorite movies of all time, PERIOD. I can not think of another movie that combines so many movie qualities like this. This film has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad and even some Romance (even without an innocent "kiss" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). Perhaps best of all, you do not have to be in Mensa to "catch" and enjoy the movie as you do with some of the other Miyazaki movies (I do not know about you, but I watch movies to pause thinking). This is just a nice movie that everyone will enjoy, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. The only sour note is the American dubbing. I found the Vander-Geek simply annoying. But all is not lost, the original Japanese version is in the set of two albums and it's awesome! Who cares if you can not understand the Japanese spoken? If you can read on a second-grade level, watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret.
