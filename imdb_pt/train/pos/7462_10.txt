Note: These comments are for people who saw the movie. <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a brilliant, complex and thrilling film that explores existentially exactly what the slogan says: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. Perhaps the storyline of the film might come into focus for confused moviegoers if we look at it from a different angle. <br /> <br /> Now, I have not gone painstakingly through the movie scene by scene, so I will have to examine my assertions better, (and I thank your thoughts), but try it out and see if the movie does not fit: where exactly does the devious "mend" occur? <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not talking about the splice as explained by the 'technical' LE, since the sequence itself could be interpreted as a rationalization within David Aames's mind / dream / coma state, but the true connection between reality and dream. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the reality of the car accident, the way it is filmed (without explosion, for example) is a likely point of "splicing," and that any particular sequence containing an existential / of dream / coma / non-reality - whether it is shown on the screen before or after the accident - is actually a part of Aames's personal journey toward self-realization within his own mind. <br /> <br /> In this respect, then, we have two questions in the end itself (if you know too much, let me know): Aames is really disfigured, and where does he wake up? <br /> <br /> If you do not get completely involved in the exact sequence of details in the plot, or at what particular point your dreams are scattered everywhere, this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human being on a journey to find yourself and this means in today's pop culture society. <br /> <br />
