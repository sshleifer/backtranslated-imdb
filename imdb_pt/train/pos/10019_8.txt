When it comes to movies I can be very picky, and I will complain about everything and everything that is done wrong. Although all the films had their flaws, The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count. <br /> <br /> If you read the last review (it was difficult since half of it was written in capital letters and did not contain actual information about the film), you may have been led to believe that this film did not go very well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same review, you discovered the reason for the scorn: he does not like the fact that the director is gay (or that the production team smokes crack ... apparently). So despite the fact that I have never written a review before, I found that this movie deserved one based on its merits, not the sexual orientation of its director. Let's take a look at a quick checklist: 1. Great plot? Absolutely. I will not give up a bit, but the plot is highly convincing and definitely not what you would expect based on the commercials. This is a thriller, not a horror, and should be addressed as such. The story will really amaze you, even more so because it's true (and the plot stayed pretty true to the actual events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful performance? Oh yes. Robin Williams long ago got rid of the currents of the comedy cast, and ever since he flourished into serious roles that many people would have written him only a decade ago. Again, he reaches high form in his role in The Night Listener, playing a radio host who becomes increasingly bothered and entangled in a case of ... well, I'll let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent steering? Certainly. Now, unlike the other poster I mentioned, I actually know something about direction. I have been sutdying the art of driving in school now for 3 years. Of course I do not really think that makes a difference (the only thing that matters is if you like the direction), but I thought I should simply state once again that I am basing my views here on something substantial and relevant ... by example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug habits of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's direction was somber and somber, and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create the much sought-after feelings of "tension and release" instead of the fast and cluttered camera work and quick cuts that we are so often subject to today. Some people can actually show a story through their camera, while others feel as if they have to do the story with the camera. I really appreciate it when someone nowadays has the guts to simply use the camera as it should be used, which is like an eye through which we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, cinematography and editing? Great on all sides. I've already written a lot, and I could continue on these last three things for another ten paragraphs, so I'll summarize. <br /> <br /> In short, go see this movie. Do not listen to people who have secondary motives to destroy you, especially if they are so stupid that they reveal that motive 1/4 of the way. Enjoy the show! -Ben
