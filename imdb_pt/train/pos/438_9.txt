From the rainy, gloomy late winter of England in the early 1920s ... <br /> <br /> --- where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled veterans of the great massacre of men and killer of their women's dreams . - now known as the First World War ... <br /> <br /> Four women share this sunny little Italian castle on a hill; a young widow drowning her sadness at frenzied parties, two women who rediscover their own husbands and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends ... <br /> <br /> These four women will be reunited with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual "renewal" for one of the great holidays of April in the early 1920s in Italy. <br /> <br /> NOTE to potential filmmakers. Study this movie how humor and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a movie to please many men ...) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Make a stock of coffee and hot chocolate and invite the girls to a sad winter's day ... Spring is coming ... Enchanted April promises to you!
