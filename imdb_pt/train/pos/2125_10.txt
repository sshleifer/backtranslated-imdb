This, despite not being the original - began life as a play in Central Europe - withstood the various incarnations that followed (the remake of MGM with vintage songs In The Good Old Summertime, the Broadway show She Loves Me, the excellent revival of the Paris theater a few years ago) and remains the definitive version and one that everyone has to win. Several previous commentators have identified the contributing factors that make it so successful and memorable, the fashion prevailing in the 1930s and '40s Hollywood for squandering attention and detail in the ensemble rather than just two, as so often happens today - for example, by removing Ugarte, Ferrari, Renault etc from Casablanca and yes you would still have Rick and Ilsa and Viktor Lazslo but they would just be icing without the rich cake mix below. Jimmy Stewart and Maggie Sullavan were both ideal and irreplaceable leads, but the brighter they shine when their performances are reflected in those of Frank Morgan, Felix Bressart, Joseph Schildkraut and Andy Haddy Sara Haden and that is BEFORE taking into account the 'touch' of Lubitsch. Okay, maybe they were a little more naive, innocent even in this Jurassic Age, but how many genuine movie lovers, fed up with eschatology, fucking and having direct sex, return to those days of Stories, Style, Slip and Skill and wallow in great movies like this. By far the best thing about this technological age is not CSI but the DVD that can at the same time make these classics available for nostalgia and show the Matrix freaks how big boys used to do that.
