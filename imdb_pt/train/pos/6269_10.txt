A pleasant surprise! I was hoping for an additional demotion along the line: The Rock (9) -> Ar Con (7) -> Armaggedon (4). Especially for such an exaggerated movie. Perhaps that is why so few have approved of this new type of Bruckheimer tariff. Smart dialogue instead of short sentences, decent background / motivation instead of "shake-n-bake" stereotypes and when the chase came, you really craved it. Fanboys waiting for an Armageddon roller coaster: stay away. This is one of the smarter action fans. It did not even bother me, Jolie looked so small.
