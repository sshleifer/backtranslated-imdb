Street Fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. This is not a movie you just watched for fun. It is not a comfortable experience, although it has a few moments of laughter. This is a movie you watch when you need food to think. <br /> <br /> To dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point altogether. This is not just a satire of Song of the South, it is also a scathing comment on the prejudices that Americans still have as a society. All the ethnic groups portrayed in the film are shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this exaggerated exaggeration, the filmmaker shows how absurd these true beliefs really are. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who is willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevailing prejudices that American culture still has, and if you are not afraid to see your own prejudices in the eye, this movie can be for you.
