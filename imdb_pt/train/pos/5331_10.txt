just watched on Sky TV lost the first half hour. I wondered if it was a true story, so I watched until the end. There was no summary at the end to say what happened to everyone. this reminded me of speed, but at the end of the day I did not think it was released in the movies, as we saw the following error. the joke we saw was that they remove the hood (hood) and later there are two shots of the car with the police car in front trying to slow it down when the hood is back. had me on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought the baby was going to hit the bridge and of course when the bridge was not going to be lowered and then it was. I'm afraid I started crying, so it was not so bad !!!!
