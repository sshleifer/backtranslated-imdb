A very close and acute description of the bubbly and dynamic emotional world of an 18-year-old guy who makes his first experiences in his gay love for another kid while on vacation with a part of his family. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie because of its extremely clear and substitute narrative, with all those "Sound-close-ups" and quiet moments that were full of intense moods. <br /> <br />
