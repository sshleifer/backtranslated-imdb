"Foxes" is a movie I remember for portraying teenagers in the late 70's. As I am exactly the age of Jodie Foster, I related to this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships and rebellion of youth. The soundtrack is great with inspiring rock, for example. "More Than a Feeling" from Boston and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donna Summer. The music of my late teens. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it is not huge.
