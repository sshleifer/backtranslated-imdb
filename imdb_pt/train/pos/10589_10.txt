I liked Longstreet, who was following in the footsteps of Raymond Burr's hit TV series Ironside and intended to give it competition. But this show was canceled after a season because it was decided - erroneously I believe - that Longstreet was not able to compete with the Burr Ironside. <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot of this program was especially well done and very memorable. I hope a Longstreet box pops up. <br /> <br /> Writers should note that this idea of ​​the story was briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and the interaction of deficiencies on TV. .
