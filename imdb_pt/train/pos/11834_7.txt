I love horses and admire hand-drawn animation, so I expected nothing less than awe of the new animated Dreamworks, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. I think you could say I was a bit disappointed. You have a wonderful animation and at the beginning what appears to be a perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. Animals do not sing cute songs or even talk - a big plus. Unfortunately, the film has an unnecessary narration by Matt Damon; a soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare him to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the filmmakers stayed simply, we would have a masterpiece here. This is not a great movie, but it is good entertainment for small children. I would recommend this movie to families because it has the heart in the right place and it is the only thing out there now that is not offensive to small children. Not bad, but could have been a lot better. Very cute visuals though.
