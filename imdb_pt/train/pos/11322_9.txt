This anime seriously taped my socks. When the anime opened for the first time, I felt it was very slow; the story was not going much further, and Shirou was a rather blank man. Once he learns more about tracking, and you learn more about the Saber and the Holy Grail War, the story unfolds and you can see multiple facets moving together. It was fantastic. <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that the way the characters developed was very true to the way real people develop in the real world. There was no completely obvious stupid thing going on; The development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch, but I think the way Shirou and Sabre grew up in their personalities was very interesting to watch all on. Some of the "surprise" people that appear (Gilgamesh?) Seemed to be also unique from the rest of the cast in one form or another, which means we did not have "Generic Bad-ass A" being replaced by "Generic Bad-ass B" so A died. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I loved the song. The opening song rocked, and the final theme of the final episode just ... Seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more. Good job, Type-MOON!
