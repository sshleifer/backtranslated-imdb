This is the beginning of an interesting new Star Trek series. It has a "floor down" - kind of scene with darker and less "complicated" scenarios. <br /> <br /> Characters need more time to develop, but have potential. One thing that is quite disappointing (with the entire Star Trek series) is that they portray such a grim picture of equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture on everything else. (Earth stopped war, hunger, etc.) The female characters here are two, Subcomandante T'Pol who is a Vulcan and communications officer Hoshi who is human. Hoshi is very weak and T'Pol is made to be a "Vulcan baby". <br /> <br /> Some of the crew's attitudes seem a bit American (as opposed to the more international feel of the TNG team). but creates interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> A very good driver for a very good series.
