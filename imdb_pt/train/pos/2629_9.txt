I was not sure when I heard about it coming out. I was thinking about how Disney is getting dumb. I was wrong. I thought it was very good. I mean, it's not the Lion King, but it's nice to see another side to a certain extent. It was very funny. Also it was not one of those tacky disney sequels were the animation sucks, it was like the animation of the Lion King. The only thing that stimulated me was the whole movie thing throughout the movie. Not to give anything, but you know what I'm talking about. I also had fun that it was cool to have most of the original cast to return. It was a very good movie.
