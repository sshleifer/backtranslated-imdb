If this is a portrait of the American serial killer, it will be decidedly common. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Duchovny] travels across the country to California to document America's most famous killers, unaware that one of his fellow white trash companions [Pitt] is a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Predictably everywhere, this has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well, but I did not bother to see it again.
