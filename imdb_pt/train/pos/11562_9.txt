I just can not understand how brilliant the pair of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's as if the film does not need additional characters because you can never get over the dialogue between those two. Lemmon has been in several films known as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau has been out of his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder movie also with Lemmon). This particular movie was not as good as this one because the story could not sustain such a long time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this takes about an hour and a half, although the introduction of the events that led to Lemmon ending up in Matthau's apartment is a bit long (as well as that phrase). This is a simple problem and for the rest of the runtime, you have a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> I've already written a comment about how the continuation of this movie sucks and I will not delve deeper. for this. The reason this is such a joy is probably that the film was made exactly as the innocence of American films was beginning to quickly disappear into oblivion. There are some sexual references, but they are treated so innocently that you could not even get a "Well, I never ..." from the most humble person out there. It's fun to watch a movie from a lost era a long time ago and that's probably why the sequence did not work because you made Matthau and Lemmon say some f-words and it just does not fit them. <BR> Of course, now they are gone and you can be happy that you can still enjoy them in a wonderful movie like this. I think the only actor in this movie that is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So you have it. Simply one of the best comedies and movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Add: I just learned recently that John Fiedler died, so for all his fans I'm deeply sorry. I did not mean any disrespect and I will try to be more careful with what I am blah blah blah next time.
