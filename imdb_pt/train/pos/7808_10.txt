This is a movie that everyone should watch. In addition to raising extremely important points (while South Africa is on the way to recovery, there are still many countries in similar situations now), it is superbly directed, while Denzel Washington gives, in my opinion, the best performance of his career so far. Kline also performs well, though perhaps not as impressive as Washington. John Thaw also makes a good presentation as Chief of Police. <br /> <br /> There are so many possible areas where a film about apartheid may fall, but all of them have been avoided. It would be easy to simply portray whites as bandits and blacks as the good guys, but Attenborough did not. Of course, there were some white characters who seemed intrinsically evil, like the Captain in the Soweto insurrection, but adding extra dimensions to all the characters would make the movie unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the movie, but I think it takes two and a half hours to tell the whole story, because it's really incredible. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is the funeral of Steve Biko. When the whole crowd starts singing the South African national anthem, it's probably one of the most moving scenes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, watch it. It may not be a comfortable viewing, but it certainly is worth it.
