Watching this movie from beginning to end without falling into laughter at some point requires almost an act of faith, as one has to keep saying to oneself, "it's old," "it's a classic," "be gentle," not because a movie is so bad, but because at its best is so good. This is a dated movie. It's also a classic, if it's a stained. I'm not inclined to laugh at people in any way, in principle, and I get more than a little annoyed when others do. Making fun of the Informant is a bit like laughing at a silly sage when he sucks his orange juice all over the tablecloth. Yes, one says to himself, he is an idiot, and yet when he is at the top of his game he is also a true sage. The same goes for the Informer, who is actually very terrible, and yet boasts a splendid photograph, a good performance, a wonderful soundtrack and a simple and decent story. In the end, which I will not give, politics, religion, and psychology come together in a church, so as to make the scene look cheesy and exaggerated, and yet life is sometimes. People ignorant of simple faith behave differently from us (presumably brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so unbelievable (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as embarrassing. However, people behave like that, say things like that. Not everyone is cool, and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be cool. Are people today far superior to those of seventy or eighty years ago? And in what way? I think not. We're just different Now go watch the movie.
