This review is for the extended cut of this movie. <br /> <br /> I watched Dragon Lord for the first time when I bought it on DVD many years ago. I've always liked this movie and you can read some of its more positive reviews to get a general idea. <br /> <br /> That said. I always found the plot a bit confusing. The film is, after all, a love story. And it always seemed strange to me that a love story would end with a 20-minute fight scene. <br /> <br /> Well, in the extended version this is not so anymore. The old version "original" begins with a huge sequence of barrel-climbing / rugby, which is the new final sequence in the extended version. The opening sequence is Dragon (Jackie Chan) hanging in your home and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father's around. <br /> Other sequences have also been changed or extended in the extended cut and the story makes much more sense when you watch. The pace is also better and, overall, works better. It seems more like a love story and does not let you ask questions about why it ends as drastically and dramatically as the regular version. <br /> <br /> I suggest everyone who is a Hong Kong film, or just Jackie Chan, the fanatic talk about the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally planned. (Or at least that's how I think it was planned. Why they could do this and rearrange some of the scenes?) When I was done watching, I felt like I had seen a completely new film Jackie Chan, although most of the sequences were the same.
