Previously, I wrote that I loved "Titanic", I cried at its end (many times), and I'm a 60 year old guy. I also wondered why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, received only a rating of 7.0 from imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the unfolding of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes scored 10, 10.7% gave a 1 rating. These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users actually reduced the overall rating to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden increase in 1 rating, with a high score of 10, falling only gradually and suddenly reversing course and jumping level 1 rating) in just one thing: hatred by Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I tuned in enough chat rooms to see the jokes of the young men (mostly young men) who smeared him on the left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in "Titanic". (To respond to another user: I'm not talking about someone who does not really like the movie so much, and gave a 5 or a 6, etc. Everyone has, and is entitled to, their own taste.But nobody can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for the "Titanic," drawn to that level by an excessive number of ridiculous ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall film. Let me demonstrate my point, comparing the voting pattern of the user imdb from "Titanic" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was withdrawn of the movie theaters quickly after a very bad box office, and imdb voter rates were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating 6.1). "Big Top Pee-wee" (1988) ) "Cat People" (1982) scored 6.1% and rated it 10%. 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) scored 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) scored 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2). WHAT ALL THESE MOVIES HAVE IN COMMON WITH "TITANIC"? ALL THE PERCENTAGES OF ITS 1 CLASSIFICATIONS ARE LOWER !!!! THAN "TITANIC", AND NO OF THESE PATTERNS WERE INDICATED FOR A SINGLE PRIZE. Once again, "Titanic" got 10.7% 1 votes! Compare that with the other 5 movies I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Can there be any other explanation besides the hatred of the Leo factor? <br /> <br />
