I watched this movie a second time to try to find out why it was not as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit - which may have been its commercial ruin. /> <br /> First, this movie tries "serious" science fiction, social commentary, more than action-adventure. There is action in this, but that is not quite what it is about. If you focus on this, you'll end up with (as others have noticed) a bad clone of "Aliens". But again, that's not what it's all about. <br /> <br /> The film is about Todd's (Kurt Russell) transformation from human to quasi-machine and back to human (mostly * back *). But since he is not trying to give you a typically Hollywood answer, Kurt Russell needs to make that transformation without speaking, and to a large extent, without broad expressions. And he really does a wonderful job - it can take two visions to enjoy it. The "social logic" surrounding is flawed and is never adequately explained if Todd's ability to stand against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound discovery humanity or what, but the film is still a wonderful showcase for Russell's talent (easy to underestimate).
