Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and medium performances, it certainly is not. When I saw the movie, I knew it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of a fairy tale than an adventure movie. It has this magical aura from the beginning to the end of the movie. The plot is well written and holds you at the tip of your seat. Like every tale, it has a bit of morality. Therefore, we know in our hearts that the evil brothers will not assume the throne, but the innocent boy who can overcome all the obstacles and difficulties that he encounters during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the material girl who is superficial and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to give extra credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this movie. Your eyes have that glow that totally fits your character. In addition, she and Cox have chemistry that makes the novel in the film even more remarkable. The rest of the cast are well-known actors and actresses who, of course, make Stardust an interesting and highly rated film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is FANTASTIC, the magic places and the plot are interesting.I was very disappointed that the movie was not nominated for more prizes. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this.
