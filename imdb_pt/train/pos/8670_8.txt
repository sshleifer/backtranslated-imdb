WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Live Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs MVP in a game Inferno: So this is the fourth game ever in WWE and it's Kane vs MVP ( wonder why it was the first match on the card). I just saw the final parts where Kane puts MVP's ass on fire while they're in the apron and then the MVP is running through the arena while screaming ?? eventually, the referees put out the fire with a fire extinguisher, while the MVP spreads down the entrance ramp. Funny and visually quite funny ending. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: Originally it should be William Regal and Dave Taylor against Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) in a regular tag team match. However, GM Teddy Long arrives in the ring and announces that it will be a fatal fight of 4 teams. MNM and The Hardys are played and it's all chaos. A word to describe this eye-opener? Wow. Dude, I really can not remember how many sickly points there were in this game and words can not really do it justice. There was a particularly remarkable spot where the Hardy mounted a ladder in a seesaw position and Jeff jumped off the top rope while Matt held MNM to kill, and then WHAM! Nitro exploded while Mercury apparently ruined everything and was bleeding like hell with lacerations on his face. He had to be taken away and Nitro continued the game by himself. Another point was when Jeff powerbombing London while FLIPPING off the ladder. There were other breathtaking places that flew too high to be remembered. London finally unties its belts to win this rave show thief. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The bogeyman vs. Miz: The two men are thrown in and around the ring until Boogeyman blows a powerbomb to victory and then drools Miz's mouth as usual. 5.5 / 10 for this three-minute incognito. <br /> <br /> United States Championship: Chris Benoit (c) faces Chavo Guerrero in another typical game of Guerrero. Some good points included a superplex off the upper rope by Chavo and a strange long chain of German suplexes by Benoit. Vicki Guerrero enters the ring with the belt to preach Benoit, but Benoit frightens her and it takes a long time deciding whether to place her in a Sharpshooter or not. This allows Chavo to roll-up, but Benoit plays once again and Chavo is locked in Sharpshooter. End of the game. Good hard battle, although slow at times. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) against Jimmy Wang Yang for this, in a very moderate game. Did the game have some good high points? most notably Helms' moves away from the upper rope? but the crowd did not seem to be in it after witnessing the departure of the stairs, and Yang needs to stay in the air. Helms won the game after sending Yang away with a facebuster in the knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker Vs. Mr. Kennedy in a Last Ride Fight: After a series of games between the two, this time it's a Last Ride fight, the second of the genre and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse. Very good indeed for what these two could offer. Kennedy manipulated a good deal of Taker and even freed himself from a chokeslam to play Taker out of Armageddon about 5 meters down; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would have been brutal. Kennedy almost got the win until Taker got back into the hearse (I liked the sight of the camera inside the hearse). Taker then lost a steel barrel at Kennedy and broke the hearse window, but then knocked Kennedy open with a chair, and followed with a consecutive Chokeslam and Tombstone on the roof of the hearse. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker led him out of the arena to win. I really found myself really interested in the willingness of these guys to take / give really sick pictures. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Santa enters the ring, I go "what the heck?" like many of the children in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie contest" comes to my ear. Interval time. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena Vs. Finlay and King Booker talk about charisma vs. technicity. This match was actually a fairly good main event, with the time to move rationally from one team to another and maintain good suspense. Even Finlay got some good legitimate moves against his opponents this time (I kind of doubted his strength against the champions), and he and Booker were not able to cheat at all? except at a point where Booker slammed his scepter into Cena's throat. Batista hits the bomb in Booker for the win, failed to see the F-U; Cena performed the 5 Knuckle Shuffle anyway and I think he also did the STFU. This was probably the best technical game of the night and the participants did superbly in fact what they could without a ladder of 7.5 / 10. Being a WWE fan on-and-off, I have who would agree that The Armageddon was laced with numerous eye-catching eyes, and the ladder fight ended up swallowing half the show; The Last Ride game had some very difficult points, and the main event also performed very well in its category. All other games have also fulfilled their billing, except perhaps Boogeyman vs. The Miz and the ever useless lingerie contest. Overall, Armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view and, despite some major setbacks at the beginning of the PPV chronology, Armageddon wished this year goodbye with respect. PPV standings: 8/10.
