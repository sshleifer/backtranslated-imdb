This is the moving story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Every family has a gay son. The stories are interrelated at this point, but this movie is about all family members, not just the two kids. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well designed and the story is consistently interesting if it is a bit gloomy.
