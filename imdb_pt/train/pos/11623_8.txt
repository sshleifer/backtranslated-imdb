(You'll know what I mean after you've seen Red Eye ...) Overall, Red Eye was a better-than-expected thriller. It starts slowly and builds slowly. But by the time it turned out, it's a thumper! <br /> <br /> It's hard to pin down exactly what makes this thriller as ... thrilling as I found it. Except that the director simply did an honest job of putting him in the action of what otherwise would have been a common plot. I'd rather forget I was watching a movie. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors, I think, are the "closeness" of the victim and the villain ... and that, over time, you begin to relate to the victim. A meager 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but this is very good!
