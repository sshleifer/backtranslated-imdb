Keep in mind that I'm a fan of the genre, but I've only recently seen this movie for the first time. How I've forgotten all this time is a wonder to me. For me, this is a better movie than the highly touted "High Noon". It's a great western with great acting and a great story. The DVD is in beautiful black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you like westerns or James Stewart this movie is not to be missed.
