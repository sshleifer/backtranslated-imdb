I first saw this movie when I was flipping through the movie channels on my DirecTV parents. It was on the Sundance channel and was just beginning. I love music, especially in the late 60's and that's what the BJM looked like (The Dandys is alright). Everything about the Brian Jonestown Massacre intrigued me from the music, for the Anton and Joel personalities, for the illicit use of drugs. It was funny because while I was watching the scene of the first party when everyone was queuing, my parents passed by and decided to watch (The look on their faces was invaluable). Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the Brian Jonestown Massacre, which is now my all time favorite band. <br /> <br /> just notice ... seriously
