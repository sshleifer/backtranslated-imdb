The TV series of the 1960s Bewitched owes the idea of ​​this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made shortly after they were cast together on Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This is not as obsessive as this, but Novak is so captivating. <br /> <br /> This was the 10th film by Jack Lemmons and he is a good supporter here, as is Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this film, almost as good in support here as in The Music Man. The cast is very solid. <br /> <br /> This film has a late 1950s New York City feel and a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie. It is worth watching as it is a love story with all the excitement of anyone, and a bit of magic also boot. <br /> <br /> It's not Vertigo, but I think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - surely I'm happy that William Asher saw it, so that the series 1960 was created. I'm not so happy with what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is way better than that.
