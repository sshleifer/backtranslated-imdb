This is one of my all time favorites. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a flaw, it's like it's a furious bull. It does not involve as much the spectator as it assaults. Scarface is as voracious and inflexible as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the imagination of the beholder. <br /> <br /> Moroder's languid synthpop adjusts action to a tee. Like the choir of a Greek tragedy, it moans and cries, weeps and pulls, a constant reminder of Tony's inexorable fate. <br /> <br /> It's not so much a cautionary tale as an ongoing disaster, '' Scarface '' rips the screen with the uncontrollable force of a runaway train.
