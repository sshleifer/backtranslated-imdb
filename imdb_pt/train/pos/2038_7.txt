This movie exceeded my expectations. I thought and I heard it was going to be rubbish, so I was not expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I did not get along well with the main girl and I did not really care if she lived or died. After a while she definitely grew into me and became a nice character. It's not just a horror movie where people die for no reason. There is a background story that takes only a few seconds of the movie, but it explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you are not sure, just watch anyway, it's only an hour and a half of your life. You will live for 80 years anyway.
