This movie was just absolutly brilliant. It really made me think. Throughout the movie I was confused as hell. I loved everything about it ... it was so confusing and so distorted and strange, it was hard not to love. All the actors were phenomenal, and no one could have done a better job ... This is one of my favorites of the year ... deserves a nod.
