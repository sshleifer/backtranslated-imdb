Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the best in film history. <br /> <br /> I think we can all feel for "Gypo", because we all struggle with what is right and what is not wrong. This was one of the first pictures of the house of art to be released by a major American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> Joseph H. August's cinematography is at its best here. However, the stunning part of August was virtually ignored; he did not get the Oscar nomination he deserved. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all transmitted with as few words as possible.
