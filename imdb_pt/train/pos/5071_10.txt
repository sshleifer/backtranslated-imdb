I saw this movie on the Hallmark channel and found it wonderful, especially since it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the English solitary man who assumed the persona of the middle race Gray Owl. The photograph was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film made me do more research on this character, Archie Belaney, known as Gray Owl. I want to read as much as I can about it. At the time, I did not know that Richard Attenborough had directed that. But I'm not surprised. I like all of your movies whether it's acting or driving. I gave the highest note. However, I would have liked to have seen more in the film about why he took over this persona since it just showed the two aunts who made him and his room in his house. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong with this movie if you're like me and enjoy a beautiful story without listening to coarse language and invented special effects every few minutes.
