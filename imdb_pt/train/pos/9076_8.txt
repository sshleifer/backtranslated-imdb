This would have to be one of the funniest sitcoms on TV to leave the United States since the disappearance of "Everybody Loves Raymond." Warburton is always hilarious and complements the rest of the cast to perfection. David Spade continues to greatly please my funny bone with the pretty exclusive delivery of his lines. After getting enthusiastic about the British series "Coupling" I can see exactly where the creators of "Rules of Engagement" had their original idea, but this is not meant to be a "brickbat" - absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way it is transmitted, completely define this particular series. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been part of a team of professional TV comedy writers for the better part of 7 years in Australia, I can particularly appreciate the role of the director and the perceptive and creative talent of the film crew. One of the few complaints I have with the series is the obviously "canned" laugh. Certainly a live audience could have been used in the filming of the series.
