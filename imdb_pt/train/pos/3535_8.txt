** ATTENTION - CONTAINS SPOILERS! First of all, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this game. I got it for Christmas after two months giving tips to my parents. I'm glad I did that. <br /> <br /> First, I would like to say that the individual player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game when you're at a party in London, and some bad guys spoil it by abducting the prime minister's daughter. Of course you have to rescue her, and it's a very large level, but it should probably take at least five minutes. The best part, and I also find the funniest part, is when you're in the jet-pack, and people are coming down Big Ben. Just equip the most reliable rocket launcher of the jet-pack and blow up the clock dials and enemies. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but very short. There are four mini-levels that you can unlock, and that's one of the bad points, because only the first two are really fun, and the last two to be unlocked are just 'kill 25 enemies', ie c'mon! We have many points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> Multiplayer, I and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging even if there are no bots. Halo had no bot, but there are still some multiplayer games! You can be a load of thugs, and you go against the other, and you can also set traps, which is the best way to kill people without regard to their character. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus quests can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there is the odd bad graph, but this is not extremely frequent). Multiplayer - 10/10 (no need for comments, just great, you can drive in jet-packs and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Repeat value - 7/10 (the only levels I go back to are the Loondon level and Part 1 of Istanbul). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> Could have a bit of improvement, but still good.
