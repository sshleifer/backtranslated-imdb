Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, "Jacknife" did not arrive too late nor was it superfluous. He is one of the few who try to deal with the second sad side of war: the time after. Unlike films like "Taxi driver" or "Rambo," which used to feature its main characters as broken heroes in a bad post-war environment, this film allows audiences to take a different view of Vietnam veterans. Its development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all this tragedy there is always the feeling of some hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" may be the quietest movie in Vietnam, but after nearly 15 years it's really plausible and therefore justified. Besides, it may make us believe that the war is not over yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are incredible. De Niro did one of his best works, but Ed Harris is the star of the film. Possibly, this was his best ever performance.
