Peter Weir's first international success, THE LAST WAVE, is a mostly effective chiller with a fascinating story based on the Aboriginal myth. Richard Chamberlain performs well as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unrelated to reality as he delves into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries. David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does everything possible to guide Chamberlin through the realm of dreams (Dreamtime), a central alternative / chronological reality to native Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy on the air, deliberately ambiguous in the plot, the film builds a disturbing ending that is somehow diminished by poor effects, probably due to budget constraints. However, an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread that hides just below the surface of what we perceive as "reality" will remain with you.
