Most war movies made in the US during World War II were a lot of fun to watch but suffered with serious gaps in realism because they were being produced more for the sake of advertising to raise the spirits at home than anything else. I'm not hitting these movies as many of them are still very watchable. However, because they often have no realism, they are prevented from being truly great films. A perfect example was the John Garfield film Air Force - in which a B-17 almost alone consumes half of the Japanese air force! However, Pride of the Marines is a welcome departure - scoring high notes to portray a true story in a reasonably accurate way. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was not a true story, as it seemed very unlikely to be true. However, after researching more, I discovered that he was, in fact, quite faithful to the incredible story of two men who had done so much to win the Medal of Honor. This is a case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!
