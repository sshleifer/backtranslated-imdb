In Cold Blood is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is also so inclined to be realistic, sometimes it is more clinical than fun. Recalding the brutal murder of a Midwestern family, author Truman Capote focused on the minutiae, engaging himself and the reader in the subject AND in the affairs! Brooks wildly departs from this approach in favor of something closer to the docudrama. Although he films in real locations, he keeps away. The killers are portrayed as depraved jerks, which they certainly were. They are not seen as misunderstood souls (as in Capote's book) and the savagery of their act is terribly blunt. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as the killers as well as the supporting cast including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as the reporter (the character of Capote?). The striking photograph is of the great Conrad Hall.
