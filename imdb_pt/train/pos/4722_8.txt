Given the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. It is plausible, realistic and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian knights who lived in the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a downtrodden American pilot of relentless and savage Nazis.) We are attracted by strong feelings for the young, impressionable, still very brave boy - that admires the American pilot. If you're looking for special effects, superman heroes and magical endings - this movie is not for you. If you want to feel what it must have been like dodging the persistent, amoral Nazis and their lack of compassion , then you will be delighted with this movie. I really enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to this end, this movie will be one you will remember for a long time .
