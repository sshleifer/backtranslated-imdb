Firstly; I'm a dedicated fan of Modesty, and I've been reading comics since I was a kid, and I found the previous films about our heroine unsatisfying, but where they fail, that's a ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well then, here we go: Mrs. Blaise is working for a casino, a gang of thieves appears and she starts playing for the lives of her friends. If the thief wins a round, she will have to tell him about herself. If she wins twice in a row, one of the team members is free. (It sounds stupid, yeah, well, I'm not that good at explaining too ...);) <br /> <br /> She tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about having her helped an old woman in the refugee camp and how they escape, living according to the rules of nature. They hunt for food, and he teaches them to read and fight. As they approach civilization, they are caught in a war, and when they are led into rebellion, they are being shot and the old man dies, leaving him to know the city by himself. <br /> <br /> So she knows the man who is the casino she's working for now, and then the story ends. <br /> <br /> What follows is that there is an incredible fight and the line is totally legal. Alexandra Staden is a modest Blaise! As modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as that of comics. <br /> <br /> It seems strange, we also hear Modesty speak with a slightly broken accent, but this is not relevant, since the comic book can not speak out loud, but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent. (Not to mention it's weird everyone speaks English in the Balkans ..) <br /> <br /> The acting is very good, even the child who embodies the young Blaise must have a round of applause! <br /> <br /> My favorite part should be where she rips the dress to kick the idiot thief's ass! Totally awesome! : D I can not wait until the real adventure starts in the next movie / s! <br /> <br /> See, you will not be disappointed!
