The arrival of a world famous master sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by how it handles the church choir and how people gradually change. This movie is comforting and makes you leave the movies with a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It's about bringing the best of people and Kay Pollak wrote an excellent script based on the ideas for which he became so famous. The actors are notable, Michael Nyqvist we met before, but Frida Hallgren was a new and charming acquaintance to me. She has a more vivid face that does not leave anyone untouched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost very well, he's too horrible to see. One wish is for him to be cast to play a cool guy one day, so we can see if he dominates the character as well. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you have not seen it, do it today!
