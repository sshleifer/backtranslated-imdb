This story is beautifully represented. It's sad and comforting a young woman's journey to find out where she came from and where she's going. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car accident, and since she was labeled as the "miracle baby," she is dyslexic and is finding life a little difficult. His discoveries along the way affect the people closest to him. Your relationship with your guardian and ex-boyfriend of your tutor is treated with sensitivity and sensitivity, and the entire support cast is genuine, three-dimensional, and compelling. Set around a peach cannery factory in the small town of Australia, this is a warm, gentle and erotic movie, and leaves you feeling nice when the credits close. After reading some of the other superficial comments on Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly scaled up and extremely sexy. No, he's not Brad Pitt, but that does not mean he's not attractive.
