When I sat down at the movies I was in a good mood and I was not planning to change that. But this movie is a dramatic power. I was all sweaty and needed a shower after. So what do we have? Theoretically, a maturing story of a Turkish teenager who lives in Copenhagen, Denmark. It soon dawned on me that the plot seemed almost completely borrowed from "Bend it like Beckham," where we had an Indian girl playing football and spoiling her sister's wedding. Here we have transferred to a Turkish girl ruining her brother's marriage by making Kung Fu. And we also have a love story and a competition, of course. After I accepted this, it really became an emotional and emotional drama, and it shows a beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert, though). The lead actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's women's champion but also performs well, so it seems safe to assume we have some autobiographical impressions here, given that this is her first movie and she has no education as an actress. Rest of support cast is fine, good camera, intense Kung Fu. Sidenotes: - The Turkish male audience showed respect for them to have done something right. The audience exploded as our heroine finally retaliated and attacked the boys who were beating their brother in revenge. - Xian Gao, a Chinese Kung Fu film instructor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) played the main role of the master <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it in the movies, you will probably have a good experience and intense and I do not know if this works on the small screen too
