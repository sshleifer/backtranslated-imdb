The Hidden Frontier has been spoken and reported by various news agencies for their long-standing commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and for providing an example of the union that was Gene Roddenberry's mission. Its focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of different races is equal to or greater than other series and films in the Trek series. The value of production began as smaller and unstable, but over the course of 7 production seasons the performance improved, the stories are more complex and the visual graphics became softer and more impressive. In the season 6 episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the biggest space battles in the history of the Trek. The ships are rendered well and the space battles are awesome and exciting. The real attraction for Frontier is not the ships or the backs, but it's the people, the interaction and the growth of the characters. There are also nods to other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know about. I recommend any Trek fan to check Countermeasures and you will be hooked!
