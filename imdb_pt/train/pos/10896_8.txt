At first I did not think Ben Affleck could really make a funny Christmas movie, boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to watch it with her and I was not disappointed. James Gandolfini was funny, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O'Hara was also good, the plot is what really sold me, I mean, I also ate with the family, at the table for the people you hardly see anymore once or twice a year, and probably do not get along anyway, you really need as much alcohol as your system can withstand to deal with Christmas, so I thought the premise was good there, buying the family with $ 250,000 , it was a little far, but it worked out very well for me, because it was a riot all the time, shows the class struggle of the different families. There are many funny moments, including embarrassing things on the computer for a teenager. All in all, I loved this movie and watched it again next Christmas or sooner if my daughter wants it too.
