I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 13 years old. It surprised me and in many ways still does it now. But I'm less inclined to see this as a historical piece needs now. There is very little effort made to examine and interact with racism - and therefore fails to recognize that the most potent anti-racism weapon is to understand it in its essence in those who commit it. What we have instead is a dichotomy - on the one hand, the beko and the forest in the 3D panoramic view of the rainbow - on the other, two three-dimensional characters are portrayed as an unthought and thoughtless evil. <br /> <br /> All this contributes to a great story of the film, but I worry that people see the picture as "accurate."
