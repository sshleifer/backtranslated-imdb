What a fun and sexy movie! They certainly do not do it any more. 4 sexy au pairs come to London and have all sorts of sexual misadventures. The tone is strangely innocent, as considerable nudity evolves from ridiculous situations, rather than any obvious sexual desire on the part of the characters. It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become unbridled. Richard O 'Sullivan literally receives' Randi' (sic). The film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties movies and old school naturism. My special interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I am a big fan of Gabrielle Drake. If any actress has ever looked better naked (she's thin but beautifully curvaceous), or dressed, come to that (I've loved her since the original UFO race - who else could wear a purple wig!), I'm going to eat my hat.
