About two hundred members of a Cinematheque film society from Cleveland, Ohio, met on August 19, 2000 to see a film print of Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 movie, "Zabriskie Point." Cinematheque director John Ewing, who does a superlative job of getting the best prints for his series, shared with the audience beforehand that this engraving was specially brought from Italy to this only showing. <br /> <br /> The audience was fascinated when the film unfolded artistically on the huge panoramic screen. Watching this superb print, shown the way Antonioni intended, made one aware that this is indeed a work of modern art. It was even more fitting that the series was at the Cleveland Insti- tute of Art at University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions are created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful balance of images, impressive use of colors, radical choreographic movements, all are the work of a genuine artist, using the screen as his canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally, the public could understand "Zabriskie Point". As his narrative unfolded, it became obvious that this work is not about the story itself, but about the impressionistic representation of an artist of fleeting images of his subject. The setting for some of the more turbulent activities of the 1960s provides only a dramatic engine for the artist's sweeping collage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not limited by conventional narrative patterns, and can stop at any moment to creatively embroider an event with grandiose embellishments. The audience willingly followed the flow of their remarkable imagination, while their enormous images on the massive screen held an ecstatic attention. Although the audience may have been only tangentially involved in character relationships, he realized that the theme here is the human allele, the director's recurring theme. <br /> <br /> It has also been realized that no lower or lower quality printing than this original on Cinemascope can do justice to this particular rendering. The audience was therefore even more grateful to see "Zabriskie Point" in its original and breathtaking format, and came to thunderous applause at the end.
