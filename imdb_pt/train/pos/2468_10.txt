I went to see Hamlet because he was among the jobs. I figured 4 hours would be great, I'm Branagh's fan; Dead Again, Henry V. I was completely impressed by the direction, acting and cinematography that this film captured. Like other reviews the 4 hours passes quickly. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he's Hamlet, he was born for it. When I watch this movie, I'm constantly trying to find flaws, I looked at the nonsense and did not notice them. As he was able to move the camera in and out of the Hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This film was filmed at 70 thousand. It's a shame that Columbia has not released a Widescreen version on VHS. I own a DVD player, and I would take it to the Titanic at any time. So Columbia, if you're listening, put this movie the way it should be seen! And I do not know what happened at the Oscars. That should have swept Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, best cinematography. What movies were they watching? I felt sorry for Branagh at the Oscars when he did a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They should have paid tribute to Branagh for bringing us one of the greatest films of all time.
