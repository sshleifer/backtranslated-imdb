Even Shirley's longtime fans may be surprised by "Now and Forever." Was the movie filmed with Paramount Studios? not with Shirley's controlling company, Twentieth Century Fox? in 1934, before Fox's producer Darryl Zanuck had perfected Shirley's successful formula (cute songs, cold hearts to melt her, young couples to play the cupid, happy endings). So, "Now and Forever" falls into the category of a Shirley vehicle without the standard story of Shirley. It's an uncomfortable position for any movie, but this impressive and talented cast does the job. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star as irresponsible and entertaining swindlers, Jerry and Toni Day. The only thing this devoted and dysfunctional duo seems to hate more than being together is being apart. When they are suddenly landed with the custody of Jerry's young daughter, Penny (Shirley Temple), is Toni ?? and not Penny, as many believe? which convinces Jerry to give up his criminal career. But Jerry gets fumbled in his work at the table, and desperate to prove that he can support his new family, he soon returns to thieves and dishonesty. In a standard Shirley device, Penny tries to melt the heart of the grumpy Felix Evans, victim of one of Jerry's cons, but his attempt fails, as Evans is revealed as a rogue and blackmails Jerry to help him steal jewelry. The drama, shooting, death and sadness that follow make this film very unusual for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, no dancing, and only a string of songs (the cute number "The world gives me a life"). <br /> <br /> But that does not mean Shirley fans should avoid "Now and Forever." "Instead, it's divergence from the usual Shirley story to make it more interesting and memorable than many of his other films.But beware: you should avoid the color version of this movie and see it in black and white if The color is bright, garish and unreal, and in many scenes, Shirley's famous curls are actually red rather than blond.
