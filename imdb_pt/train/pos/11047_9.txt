I waited for a few years before this movie was finally released in England, but I was very pleased when I finally saw it. There are many good things in the movie, to get acting. It's not something I need so much in a horror image, but the people in this movie put it all in a good job. This and the constantly exciting and interesting script, with a good luck of Lovecraftian, give the film a true solid backbone. Add to that the doses of surreal nightmare images and occasional gore horrors and the films a winner. Also has my favorite type of blood, supernatural and splattery. In addition, the characters of Marcus, the transgender bodybuilder and Daisy, his mentally retarded lover / toy are genuinely extravagant and unnerving at times, and step out, anything goes through the morbid madness that works well with the frequent Freudian connotations . . This is one of the most impressive recent horror films, far more shocking or more than anything Hollywood can produce. My only complaint is that I wanted the ending to be somber in tone, but it still works, so overall, I would really recommend this to serious horror fans.
