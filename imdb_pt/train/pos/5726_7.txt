"The Grudge" is a remake of the popular Japanese horror film series from Shimizu. Shimizu knows he's not dealing with anything new, so he does what any intelligent person would do instead: he forgets logic and focuses on giving viewers a fun ride. He uses commonly known cliches associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative way. Nonlinear narrative is not a mere trick, but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. In the end, all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror movie is to scare the public (just as a comedy is to make people laugh), this movie was successful. I watched a theater with an audience and it was fun to watch viewers go crazy about it. Probably does not play so well in your living room.
