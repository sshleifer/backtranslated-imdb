The most agile fat guy in the martial arts does it again. An old Sammo movie that makes him imitate the hero of his character, Bruce Lee, Sammo is unbelievably similar to Lee in his actions and struggles. The way he slides in Bruce's style and then back to his own, more familiar kung fu, is a joy to watch and shows how talented and adaptable he is in his art. Play some such beloved slapstick humor from this type of movie and this a movie that has it all - comedy (some unintentional, like the fake black guy), action and some amazing fight scenes. <br /> <br /> A great beer and friends movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone's time.
