The movie Freddy is dead the final nightmare is as horrible and disturbing as any other Nightmare on Elm Street, yes it has comedy essence on it so have all the other movies but how can anyone say that you would not find Freddy Krueger scary , if you came across this man in your dreams, you would not find him even more scary with a comedic essence about him because his comedy shows that he does not mind killing you, which he finds extremely funny, and Freddy plays too comic games with them, which in their own way is very disturbing, using their comic ways, I think it makes horror movies Nightmare on elm street what they are today, Writers are extremely intelligent making Krueger comic and scary how to oppose to Jason Vorhees, who says nothing and does not have the wit to really scare his victims, this movie is as good as Freddy's wit, and I would recommend him to lquer one with a sense of humor and by the way "do not fall asleep! ".
