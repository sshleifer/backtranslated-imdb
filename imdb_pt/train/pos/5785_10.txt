While reading the comments left for this show, I could not help noticing that a large percentage of the reviewers had not actually watched any episode of the show either completely or of their own volition. The Thing About Kerching! is that it is a program for children, FOR CHILDREN, so obviously if you are older, it will seem extravagant, forced and probably stupid. I even met someone saying the scenarios were stupid, but I remember an eight-year-old wondering why the Taj had icecube mold on his wall and also wondering if my parents would let me stick a little in my ). Yes, this can be annoying, the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird stuff with their hair, but as a kid show, I rate it 10/10. Compared to the things they put in their place today, well, let's just say that I would like to be re-displayed. DVD release, anyone?
