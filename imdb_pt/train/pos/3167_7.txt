This is one of those films that exploit the cultural clash of Eastern-born people in Westernized cultures. <br /> <br /> Loving in Tokyo Time is a sad movie about the inability of opposites to attract due to great cultural differences. Ken, a rock n 'roll fan, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so she can stay in the United States when her visa expires. It is hoped that the marriage is only temporary, that is, until Kyoto gets legal status again. But Ken, who seems to be lost in every relationship, likes Kyoto and strives to make things work. This, despite his friend insisting that abandoning Kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n 'roll, except to inspire a few compositions about broken hearts and all that. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese education, and does not expect to marry Ken for so long. Not only that, she's homesick and wants to go back to Japan. It's sad that this is finally someone with whom Ken thinks he can love and be with all of it except the one time he thinks he's found someone to feel so the girl does not expect to stay that long. It's not that she does not like Ken, it's just that she's accustomed to a different way of life. She says, "I can not tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a sad love story with a techno-nintendo soundtrack from the 80's. <br /> <br /> I caught Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 1980s films, Tokyo Pop. those who liked Loving on Tokyo Time, check out Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a cover band from American Japan), except it's a movie with a happy ending. <br />>
