"Sasquatch Hunters" was not really as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> < Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet (Stacey Branscombe) escort Dr. Helen Gilbert, (Amy Shelton-White) their boss Dr. Ethan Edwards, (Gary Sturm) and assistant Louise Keaton, (Juliana Dever) to find the site of some renowned bones found in the area. When they camp, the team discovers a giant graveyard and more strange bones scattered around the area. When group members begin to disappear, they begin to wander the forest safely. It turned out that a Sasquatch was behind the murders, and the team came together to survive. <br /> <br /> The Good News: This was not as bad as I thought it would be. The film really begins to gain strength in the middle of the path when the creature attacks. This is a masterful series of scenes, as the entire group is subjected to creature attacks, and suspense throughout the play-out is extremely loud. The wooded area is most appropriately milked during these parts, increasing the tension and wondering when a single person wandering through the forest will receive their reward. Also spreading quite liberally through the film is the effective use of roars off the screen and roars that are truly unusually. They really add a lot to make this part so scary, just like the other times the growling cry is heard. It is quite effective and works well. It's good that the back of the film reaches the beat, as it does very well on a high note of action. An especially scene that I feel must point out as being a special scene at first viewing. When a man crosses the forest of the creature, he sees the expedition still searching for it. Raising his hands for help, the second he will announce his presence, he is attacked from nowhere and killed hastily. He caught me by surprise and really gave me a little jump the first time I watched. <br /> <br /> The bad news: There were only a few things to complain about here, and one is a usual complaint. The creature here is mostly represented by horrible CGI, which made it seem totally ridiculous and destroys whatever credibility it may have had. The air of threat conjured by the opening of the film is almost thrown by the window when the creature appears on the screen. It's so disturbing that it's a shame that a little more work was not put into it. I've complained a lot about it, and it's something that really should be eliminated, since it does not look so realistic and is quite false. Another big problem is that the off-screen kills here. Often, in the movie, a person is grabbed and then ripped out and then finds the body bloody afterwards. It is very aggravating when the deaths seem good and succulent afterwards. Otherwise, I do not really have much problem with this, since everything else that is usually criticized for this does not bother me, but is asked of others besides that stuff. <br /> <br /> The Final Verdict: I kind of liked this, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie. It's not to be taken seriously, and if seen that way, it's really enjoyable. Fans of these movies should take a look at this, and those who like Sci-Fi Creature Features can find some cool stuff here. <br /> <br /> A: Graphic Language, Violence and some graphic frames
