I'll be honest, I finally checked this movie out not because of the stars - although they were reasonably watchable and convincing, particularly the three clues - or even the compelling story of a violation in the Presidential Secret Service (something, I ' DVD extras of this show, still have to happen. Whereas that's true, this is remarkable!). I understood why it was directed and has a choice of cameo by none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Okay, Clark Johnson, one of my favorite "Homicide: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mostly) TV director. I'd say he does the most he can with a project that is assistive, but fairly average, despite the possibilities. <br /> <br /> Veteran and secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) has to find out both who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend, blew and blew up an Air Force One helicopter and is shooting at Prez ( David Rasche. Does anyone remember "Mallet"?). Your affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger, clearly one of the first hottest ladies we've ever had, fictitious or real) is certainly not helping in her position. He has to uncover the real mole in the service and avoid the dog as hunter of his former best friend and companion agent and chief (Kiefer Sutherland, almost still completely in "24" mode). Join some other important Service agents (Martin Donovan and Foxy, a bit hard to buy as the Eva Longorria show) and obscure foreign characters and you have a fairly standardized political thriller that does not aim to reach the desired level. , if nothing astonishing, it turns out. <br /> <br /> The summary line is about the best way to describe how this show unfolds without giving spoilers. The DVD extras for me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie, although the movie itself was fun enough to keep the majority (myself included) interested.
