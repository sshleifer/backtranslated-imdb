I really do not understand why people get so upset and make this movie! Remember folks, this is an SNL movie, not something that is unpredictable and original in the plot or direction! The Ladies Man is a hilarious, albeit sometimes stupid, movie with a perverted cast and, as usual, WONDERFUL performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are unbelievable, but its comedy! I really do not understand how anyone could not laugh too much during this hilarious movie. Anyway, all I ask is that people take it as it is - an SNL comedy, silly and irreverent. Nothing that will win awards, but nevertheless some modern comedy of gold. "10-4 Apricot!"
