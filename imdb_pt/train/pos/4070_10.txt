I know anime. I went through this long before it became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z was. And just so you know I'm not bragging about mine, let me just say: Of all the anime I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious that people say Spirited Away is the best, but I really disagree. Most people only know this movie because it's an Acedmy award; this is not an exaggeration - I showed Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who had only seen Spirited Away, and they agreed that the last two are the superiors of the three. Personally, I never thought anything could compare to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think the prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with him; In many ways, Castle has important elements that Mononoke was missing out on. In both cases, if you've only seen Spirited Away, and you think this is the best Miyazaki movie, be prepared to have your land shaken.
