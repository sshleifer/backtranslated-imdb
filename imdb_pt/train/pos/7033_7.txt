First of all, DO NOT call this a remake of the movie '63. Even though this version is more faithful to the stage, it is extremely long. The cast was good with a few exceptions. Chyna Phillips was not a good casting choice. She was almost 30 when she made this movie, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. Tyne Daly overcomes his part as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny as Harry McAffee, and showed that he could even hear a song. Like the 1963 movie, they cast a stranger to play Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch amused himself with his role as Birdie and showed. I even have the soundtrack and I love to hear your singing. So what made it a failure of the audience? It was time consuming for one. They put in new songs and scenes. Although some of the new songs were good (like "Let's Settle Down"), was it really necessary? Now, do not get me wrong, I like it, but I'd rather watch the 63 movie (see my review). This was just a case of some actors exaggerating in roles, making some changes and, once again, LENGTH. One more thing I forgot to mention is Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with paper and music. Give her any letter and she could sing them. So here's my advice coming from someone who did some Bye Bye Birdie productions: If you want to watch a fun presentation of the play, watch the 1963 movie. If you want to watch a more faithful version of the game, watch the version '95. Just take it in moderation. Do not be a hero and try to watch everything at once.
