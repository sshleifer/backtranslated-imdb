Shocking and well-made chiller is an underrated story of atrocious murders and forces of evil. <br /> <br /> A small town doctor tries to figure out who, or what, is committing a series of violent sex murders. <br /> <Incubus is a mystery, with some horrible murder sequences that turn into an off-beat and mysterious climactic turnaround. The murder scenes are intense and bloody, so this is not a scruffy movie! John Hough's direction, along with a bizarre soundtrack, combine to create a dark atmosphere of fear that runs through the film. It also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well. Beautiful movie locations and some stylish camera jobs also stand out. <br /> <br /> The cast is not bad either. The great John Cassavetes makes a solid performance as the city's new doctor. Also good are the performances of Kerrie Keane as the local reporter, Helen Hughes as city historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a tormented psychic teenager. <br /> <br /> All Incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated. out of ****
