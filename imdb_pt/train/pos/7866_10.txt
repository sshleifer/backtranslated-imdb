PAGE 3 4-Star **** Madhvi (Konkona Sen) enters her boyfriend's house and is empty. She looks here and there and then goes to his room and you take the picture - 'Ah! another girl? that baddie two-time and yes, in fact he his two timing her, but he's a guy this time. And I say "Brilliant!" <br /> <br /> END OF SPOILERS (The above scene is not really a spoiler ... but for me that's how I did not want to take my chances) <br /> <br /> When asked how this movie was , my friend replied "ah, it's just an expose of the P3 staff", which made me believe that I would be watching a stupid movie, if nothing else. When I went to the theater, I thought to myself, 'I'd better get a pen and paper to write down the bad things about this movie,' but they proved me completely wrong? and then some because I could gather only the goods. This movie was great. Great, not because it's an unconventional and non-commercial movie, but because of the intelligence in the script and how this movie tells you how to deal brilliantly with a movie that could have been a stupid and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands. /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is grace. She is so beautiful that she nailed her role perfectly as if she had been born to play this role. One of the most charming actresses I've ever seen. But this is not the only performance that is good in the film, there are Sandhya Mridul, Boman Irani and Atul Kulkarni. Particularly Sandhya Mridul, who just fires the screen. (And guess what even the uncommonly accentuated Tara Sharma normally speaks) <br /> <br /> The movies star with some bizarre parties from the movie industry celebrities and all of you and you have the idea of ​​what this movie will be about. And for about half an hour through the movie you feel almost the same. But then the film picks up the rhythm of a good plot and never lets go. Does even Boman Irani agree with this statement? 'It was a good story, Madhvi.' (Thank you). The great thing is that it addresses the question of how these people are silly in style and does not surpass it, and also addresses social issues and does not make them tedious. In the end it's all a roller coaster and Madhvi informs us that just smiling at all these people. Just the reason why I love watching movies. Eclectic film production. The script is beautiful, intelligent and witty.
