I thought the movie The Grinch Stole Christmas was a really good movie. It was not horrible, nor was it great, but it was nice to watch. I felt like Jim Carrey was a little annoying at times. They made the Grinch look like a special education person, when all he needed was to be perverse and dishonest, but still he became retarded. I thought the landscape, if not inside Grinch's cave, was beautiful, and there were some parts where I laughed. but most of the time I found it to be simply annoying. This movie might have been "so much better" if they had changed the Grinch's personality, and they included a few more laughing scenes because most of the humor was not funny. I liked How The Grinch Stole Christmas Anyway, but not is nothing to get excited about seeing.
