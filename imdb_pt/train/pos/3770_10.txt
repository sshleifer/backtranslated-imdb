When will people learn that some movies are made for fun and do not necessarily change the world? If you realize this, expect to have lots of fun while watching "Bill and Ted's fictional journey." This is a fun-to-watch movie, Keanu and Alex make a great onscreen crew by replaying their characters from "Bill and Ted's excellent adventure" with even more "style" than the first film. It's not rocket science, but it's great to laugh at, the characters are extremely capable and the story is so radical that you have to laugh. Do not expect "deep and meaningful" just expect pure fun!
