First, I do not like almost every Neil Simon movie. But there's something about it that's unique, that appeals to me, and I'd say it's among the most entertaining comedies I've ever seen. The second time I watched, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandparents? <br /> <br /> Ah, afraid that they could sue, so he turned them into men. And how boring it would be if they were just housewives, show business stars are more fun. Well, this is a personal critique, and my grandmother still lives at age 97 (she still survived the magnificent imitation of Walter Matthau!) I would deny this - but some of you must find resonance in these characters. Second, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he performed in one of the best supporting performances I can remember (and my late grandmother even liked it, though I did not recognize the similarities remarkable that she shared with the character of the movie). Very ethnic in taste, and on top, you will laugh and laugh or turn it off. For me, pleasure remains.
