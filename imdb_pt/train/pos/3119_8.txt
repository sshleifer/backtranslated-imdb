"The Ultimate Bourne" begins recklessly in the middle of the chase and explodes from there as Jason Bourne (absolutely superb Matt Damon) traces the brains behind CIA operations that made him the perfect assassin in a final attempt. to learn their true identity. A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the "man behind the curtain" is added to the cast of regulars like Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent). <br /> <br /> As the second entry in the series, I wanted the Paul Greengrass's shaky handheld camera would stay static for at least the few minutes of inactivity. However, having said that, it's a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate scenes hand-to-hand and works equally well in the chase scenes that are mostly walking and through rooftops with an occasional pile of big cars . -above. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant movement and manipulation of technologies and communications that seem to challenge the laws of physics and current capabilities. Bourne movies seem to exist in some kind of hyper-reality that is full of technology-based magic. It does not make sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but I'll be damned if it's not a blast to see them get there. With the absence of the emotional and involving Franka Potente, the writers try to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so inexperienced that it never leads to anything. Yet this can be forgiven, for, unlike "Identity" and "Supremacy," this "Ultimatum" reveals everything and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. It's a fun and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any common sense, and Damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.
