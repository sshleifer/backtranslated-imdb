Rich and alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with secretary Lauren Bacall. He marries her and is so happy that he stops drinking. However, Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks' best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stacks' nymphomaniac sister, Dorothy Malone, covets Rock. Give some complications and the movie will go out of control (in a good way). <br /> <br /> Very brilliant film in beautiful Technicolor, with clothes and jaw-dropping furniture (check out Bacall's hotel room at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in pretty, tight clothing. Basically, this is a novel with grade A production values. The story itself is a lot of fun and some of the dialogues at the beginning are hilarious. The performance of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not so good, but seeing them so young and glamorous is great ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, my knees went weak! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she deservedly won the Best Supporting Actress Award for her role. She's sexy, violent, vicious and nice ... all convincing. <br /> <br /> Fun, shiny junk. Do not miss it!
