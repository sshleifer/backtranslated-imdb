First time I watched Buster Keaton's first feature film and I have to admit I liked it a lot and would just have stumbled on it years ago. The synopsis Rohauer at the beginning warns that the impression of single nitrate Three Ages was rediscovered and recovered in 1954 well before the combustion, and many pictures that seemed hopelessly glued were separated. So it's a rocky view in some places, but I've seen and survived much worse. <br /> <br /> It would have been good as the 3 short films, but as an approach on intolerance is inventive and funny from the beginning to the finish: In the Stone Age with the villain Wallace Beery riding an elephant and the Buster helper riding a pet brontosaurus; In the Roman Age Buster riding a carriage with wheel locks and adapted for sleigh, the No Parking sign in Latin; In this technological age of speed and greed, your car falls apart in the first hump. Both he and Beery are after the girl through the ages, an endless struggle. Favorite bit: Like the caveman, he is knocked back over the edge of a cliff, but still blows a kiss on the camera - an incredible second or two! <br /> <br /> Great things, reaffirming my love for silent movie comedy.
