Elmer Fudd is laughing as he rests in his armchair and reads his comic book, with the dog comfortably near sleeping in front of the fireplace. Everything is peaceful until a flea comes jumping. (The flea is dressed in a farmer's outfit with a big sombrero and carries a bag with the name "A. Flea".) He takes the telescope and sees the dog. (We see a big figure in the dog's butt and the flea whistles in excitement, shouting "T-Bone!" He then sings, "There's food on the corner, there's food on the corner!") the plot of this cute but nasty flea, haunting the poor dog. The mutt is hilarious when it reacts to the flea. <br /> <br /> The pictures of his huge chewing teeth next to the fleeing flea are clever and the dog's dialogue made me laugh out loud a few times. This may be the funniest canine I've ever seen in a cartoon! The poor dog, under the threat of having to take a shower, not to react when the stupid flea causes him pain. It is almost painful to see how the flea uses pickaxes, jackhammers, and the like in the dog. He puts fireworks on the dog's back. It's brutal!
