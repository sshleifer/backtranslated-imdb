I have to admit that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the Festival's Artistic Director specifically recommended this film to an audience of over 200 people before another film was shown, I decided to go see it. Wow!! <br /> <br /> This film addresses the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does so without any commitment. I found myself crying several times during the movie and laughing at others. Talking about an emotional roller coaster. The main actor (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer (who was only 14 at the time of filming) and had to face this incredibly complex and difficult role. She reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider, but the role here is much more demanding as she has to play a child prostitute. Chances are she will win numerous awards. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl who was sold into prostitution by her family and kept as a sex slave in a brothel in Cambodia. She meets an American (played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role that we are not accustomed to see with him), who after spending some time with her decides to help her. At that time though, she is sold again and he is going on a quest for her around Cambodia. The story revolves and turns and the audience can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The performance was strong in all respects with a very interesting international cast. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourist), Virgine Ledoyen (playing as a social worker) and Chris Penn (one of his last films). The Asian cast was also excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult subject, it focuses on telling a compelling and powerful story. It was filmed in Cambodia (some scenes in real operation brothels), which adds to the feeling that you are almost watching a documentary. It seems that DP used many cameras and close-ups and overall it made you feel like you were there as part of the story. <br /> <br /> After the performance, I was listening to other members of the audience when they left and it seemed like they were all stunned. This is not an easy movie to watch and I salute the filmmakers for not making a "Hollywood Movie". <br /> <br /> It's by far the best movie I've seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Opinion shared by my husband and a couple of other friends.
