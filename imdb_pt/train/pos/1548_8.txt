Luckily, not knowing anything about this movie, I was curious enough to record it on TV. And then the tape was over, just five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I got it for the most part, because this is a great spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and some nebulous plots, but also very scary and even daring moments. Considering the production year of 1969, the slight lesbian tones must have raised a few eyebrows. Of course, it does not surprise anyone now, and these scenes actually look very beautiful. And it's not just about George's two actresses. <br /> <br /> The gas attack seems to hit every bystander with great force, no wonder, and it certainly hit me. Very effective. In addition, the views of both sides of the opponents give the whole story more depth throughout the usual suspense and action. This is not just a heroic tale of war on one victorious side, but it shows what lies behind victory in good and evil. Well, being a case of war, mostly bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of the composer Ennio Morricone, this is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching, but never exaggerated. And I think I have to try and get more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Let's hope they put it on DVD soon, so I can have the whole movie in my collection and more people get to know this little-known jewel.
