Yes, I'll say before you start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone excels in her role as Catherine Trammell, as well as Morrissey as Dr Glass. He is an analyst sent to evaluate her after the death of a star of the sport. The glass is drawn to a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The acting was good (besides Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent for that role. She is smart, naughty and seductive and does not look like a day older than the first. She really impressed me (as in the Casino). Morrisey was good, too. He showed a lot of vunerablitity in a role that needed it. Thewlis however was lame. He ruined his character and was over-the-top all the way. He really sucked. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not as good as the first, but Stone is a joke to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.
