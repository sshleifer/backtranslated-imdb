Unlike Tinseltown's OLLO version, DOLLY !, Jay Presson Allen's film adaptation of Ira Levin's Broadway thriller could not wait for the onstage incarnation to close before putting it on screen, so the producers decided to take advantage of the maximum White Way Rush! The opening and closing scenes of the film are filmed at the intimate Music Box Theater in New York, where DEATHTRAP has played for nearly five years. Even the finale of the movie about the marquee of the theater is a version of the famous logo of the play. (Although marketers decided to go with a more fun Rubik's Cube icon for the movie). <br /> <br /> Now with a low-priced DVD release, DEATHTRAP looks as innovative and inventive as ever. The cast is perfect (better than their counterparts on stage) and the local boy scouts should be applauded for finding an appropriately scary house for the "one room, two act thriller" to take place. Opened in a surprisingly simple and innovative way, director Sidney Lumet wisely labels any "new" material at the beginning and end of the film and leaves the perversely sinuous center of Levin alone. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the movie is a great Hollywood exit from the planks, and mine a little. The story of Levin at the beginning of the film [Helga (on a dagger): "It will be used by another woman. ABOUT THE GAME"]. Like Robert Altman's THE PLAYER, however, our new ending helps the film to bend again and blur the lines between the stage, the screen and (could it be?) Real life!
