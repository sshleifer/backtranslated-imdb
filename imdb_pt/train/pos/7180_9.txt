Twisted, bizarre, charming and hilarious! I could not stop laughing watching this movie. Darren Stein presents the films he made on the family camcorder that grew up in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look for a beginner filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, however, we all do not watch movies to be manipulated in one way or another? From the beginning, I was amused by the fact that the boys in the movies look shirtless whenever possible. Later, Darren comments on his rising homosexuality, and you can see it from the tips (great suggestions!) Of exuberance at an early age. Maybe it was just the hot weather in Southern California, who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in a stimulating environment, it's great to see that his parents supported him and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be delighted with his nascent talent behind the lenses. <br /> <br /> Put the camera in me "offers a look back to the 80's untouched by commercialism. <br /> <br /> You will remember hair, music and fashions. <br /> <br /> I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so the her return to memory was welcome.Your number of solo lip sync dance is invaluable, reinforced by Frankie Goes To Hollywood's T-shirt. <br /> <br /> Movies deal with dark themes at the time <br /> <br /> Child abuse, the Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction.No childhood is completely unconcerned, and the way Stein deals with such matters is interesting to say the least, and hilarious to see. as soon as possible!
