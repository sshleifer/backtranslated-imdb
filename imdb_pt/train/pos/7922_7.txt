In that reminiscence of horror movies, 1950s paranoia in the Cold War, Reagan-era America and high school movies, Adam Arkin plays Tony, Full Moon's stardom in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to the communist Romania and, while he is lost in the streets one night, he is bitten by a werewolf. When he returns to the United States, he can not control his animalistic desires and goes on a kill. Frustrated, he runs away from town. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to the city and enrolls in high school. He still can not control his transformations, and the city dwellers and their friends realize that he is not completely human. All this culminates during the great school football game. <br /> <br /> I hoped this was one of those 'bad' movies that were good 'from the early 1980s. But I was surprised that the movie was really, really funny. The cast, including Kenneth Mars as a pervert coach, Roz Kelly as Tony's former passion, Demond Wilson as bus driver, and Alan Arkin as an eccentric doctor, all go out with hilarious results. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I was struck by how similar writing and humor were to 'Family Guy'. 'Full Moon High' has that same attitude and is never taken seriously.
