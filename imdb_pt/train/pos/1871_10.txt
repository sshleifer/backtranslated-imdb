I was adopted at birth and certainly did not have the issues that Antwone Fisher had in the movie but I still share some of the thrills and this movie really helped to get them out and force me to deal with them. It even made me realize that I have a "missing piece" and I'm going to look for my biological parents now. <br /> <br /> I cried for almost a day after seeing this for the first time. Antwone's confrontation with her biological mother juxtaposed with her father's family's reaction to her sudden appearance is powerful for those of us who do not know what will happen if we meet our biological parents. And his self-confidence and self-assertions to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful. I really identified myself with this and my need to tell people, "Yes, I was put aside by my parents when I was born, BUT another group of parents chose me and loved me. > <br /> It also helped my wife to understand me and our foster children, who went through tragic experiences before coming to our house. And it helped me to realize just how ruined our social system is. If you remember reading the story last year about the foster child in Florida who was "lost" And then the "Miranda & Ashley" story in Oregon City where SCF ignored several complaints of sexual abuse about the man who ended up killing And the week of this movie was released, plus a story in New Jersey of three children who were ignored by the system. One died. The state apparently thought the house they were in was ok because the guardian was employed (as a stripper) and "only occasionally" wore heroin! <br /> <br /> There are so many problems that are revealed in this movie. - and they are treated so well by script and acting that Antwone Fisher should be a "Best Film" nominee, for sure. It does not matter if you are adopted or not, it is a fighter at heart that can not be ignored by anyone concerned about the children in our society.
