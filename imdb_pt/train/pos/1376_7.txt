It looks like it should be a biography of Claude Monet, but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three teenage girls in a French synchronized swim team. There are no parents or teachers to speak to, no school, and the boys are represented by a peripheral figure, the François Hun who enters the determined history from time to time and always leaves confused. <br /> Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three, just aspiring to join the team she so admires. She's kind of weird. She is not yet out of her teenage growth and has long, bony limbs, big feet, and no butts to speak. She is prognostic and flaunts those thick, wrinkled lips. After a while, your appearance grows in you and, from certain angles, it may seem captivating. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older - more, more physically developed. What a glamorous figure she cuts off her bathing suit, pacing, teasing the boys, swinging her long blond hair. But it is not what it seems. Or is she? I could not understand. The French have long paradoxes and little consistency. No wonder François is always sniffing after her. <br /> <br /> There is not much ambiguity in the character of Louse Blachere. She is also on the team, but she is mean and simple, sensitive to that, and has an intense passion for François. Blachere is a good actress and increases the character's lack of resourcefulness through her performance. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the relationships between these three, meaning intrigues, deceptions, hidden feelings, and all the rest of what we associate with girls who spend a lot of time with each other. This is obviously a tricky subject. It becomes more complicated during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele. Not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie. The only nakedness we see is considerably less than that of a shift, and the little sex that exists under the covers, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to get into the plot or in your analysis. too much, partly because it is more suggestive than expressed by action, partly because it is complex, and partly because I'm not sure I've got it all. <br /> <br /> Let me give you an example. OK. Adele is the girl that others envy. She is also quite distant and self-satisfied. Plus, she's apparently looking like all the boys and men in sight if they can be of any use to her, from the cute but stupid François to the bus driver she wants a favor on. She boasts without shame about her expertise in fellatio. When Pauline approaches her about joining the swim team, Adele uses her as a lookout during the chores with the guys. A superior, self-indulgent narcissist, you know? But then the dirty slut takes the skinny Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she is still a virgin. Same? Yes for sure. Pauline begins to approach Adele and Adele finally confesses that she would like to get rid of her hymen and would like Pauline to do it for her. Pauline, now sexually attracted to Adele, performs the task with moderate pleasure. Now Adele would very much like to start with a man, preferably older and more experienced. So she takes Pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with a guy until she follows Pauline to the toilet. The two girls are there looking at each other, without having openly expressed a sexually dyed interest in the other. But Adele is so close that Pauline slowly loosens her own reins, reaches up and kisses Adele on the lips. Adele takes a step back, smiling and says, "Now, it was not so bad, was it?", And then back to the club. <br /> <br /> This is a very close description of what is happening. between Pauline and Adele - but what the hell is going on? Initially, Adele treats Pauline as an irrelevant child, then as a close friend, finally as a potential lover - and the minute Pauline responds, Adele is satisfied. Is she using Pauline the way she seems to be wearing men? Does Adele know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I have despised Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio, the simple and mature wallflower whose expression always suggests perplexity, but who at least is completely heterosexual and the first of the three to get rid of that noisy virginity, but I just ignored it for space considerations. <br /> <br /> If you see this? By all means. (Just compare it to the typical American movie about high school kids.) For men, some of whom have never penetrated feminine mystique, this can give you an idea of ​​what it looks like in the middle.
