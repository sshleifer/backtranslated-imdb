I loved this movie, at first the smart graphics seemed strange with the grainy footage, but I quickly got into it. There must have been thousands of hours of footage and I really admire the work done to reduce it. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be the movie for you, but there are some great characters here (and some real idiots). Technically I also really liked it, they must have used a new deinterlacing algorithm or maybe the footage seemed so dark anyway, but I was not bothered with the usual artifacts seen in movie-to-movie downloads. (Open Water has driven me crazy mainly because there are cheap and progressive cameras available now and I do not see any excuses in not bombing for one if you plan to make a screen at the movies.) Sorry, this is my little speech. I definitely recommend this movie, if you've ever been involved with the music scene, have a few tragic moments, but most are hilarious, I could be accused of laughing at other misfortunes, but it's a classic piece.
