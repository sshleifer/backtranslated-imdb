The first and second seasons started shakily, with good episodes nestled between middle and sometimes cliches. But once you started setting up the universe in which it exists and began to develop your characters more, it has become much more fun and fun. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this show is the success of four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor makes him look so much better, Peter's direction is great and makes every episode a lot more fun, and Joe and Paul never fail to make a funny and interesting episode together. <br /> <br /> After understanding what the show is and getting to know the characters, I doubt you would like the show. For those who are joining the show, I suggest episodes 'The Other Side', a good serious episode, and 'Window of Opportunity', a classic comic relief episode.
