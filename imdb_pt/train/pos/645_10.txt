I hate excessively long French films, but my all-time favorite movie is the longest and most talked-about French film ever. I saw it twice in the mid 70's, and then it disappeared. But I finally got to see it again in 1999, and I fell in love again. What is more remarkable is that it looks as fresh today as it did 25 years ago. If you have not seen it yet, do not miss your chance!
