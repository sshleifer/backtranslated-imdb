I hoped this movie was a 1930 novel. Boy knows girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins back in the end. It was nothing like that. Clark Gable plays the rogue Eddie with all his charisma and his malicious eyebrow. He's hiding from the cops when he walks into Ruby's apartment (Jean Harlow), to find her covered in bubbles in the tub, no less. Instant chemistry. She tries very hard to stay for a while, but a girl can only resist that smile for so long. The heat between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes awry and Ruby ends up in a "troubled girls" pension, she feels unhappy, and thanks to the irritation her roommate gives her, she begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays Ruby perfectly speaking. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is a particularly touching scene with her playing "their music" on the piano that performs perfectly. The last fifteen minutes make me cry all the time. A truly sweet novel.
