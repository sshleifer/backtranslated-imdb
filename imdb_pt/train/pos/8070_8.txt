I do not doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Academy Award for Best Actor for this film, thanks to a three-way split between the protagonists Riots in the Bounty of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone, who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a great movie because John Ford would not have gotten his first Oscar for best director if it was not. No division involved in your prize. <br /> <br /> The movie and the story of Liam O'Flaherty that is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan, who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. . He was taken out of the box by some imbecilic trick that he pulled and wants back. He's up to his last penny and if he can not go back, he wants enough for the ticket to America. There is a twenty-pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip, played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness, he goes to Black and Tan police and reports McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is very eager to find out who sent McPhillip out and they are sure it was McLaglen. He does not have the intelligence to actually cover his own footprints. He makes a feeble effort to impersonate another man named Peter Mulligan, played by Donald Meek. He also picks up a cabriolet played by J.M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from six in the afternoon until the beginning of the following morning. Of a necessity, it is filmed in darkness and shadows, possibly becoming the first noir thriller. If it had been made after World War II, the Informant would have been classified as a great classic noir, such as Odd Man Out or The Third Man, which is very much like John Ford. very well. He took some time during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before being anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays IRA commander, Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is a harder and more cruel man than Foster has here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him, as a nice character, to give some moviegoers some interest. He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informant because the Black and Tans will pick him up and take some more from him and put the whole organization in danger. <br /> <br /> The scene of the IRA trial is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes the authority of his court, Meek is not in a position to say no. The king's justice and command do not run here. It graphically illustrates at this point, despite the occupation by the army troops and the police, the British are, in fact, losing control over the population. <br /> Of course Informer has a rather dark history with its touches of John Ford, but less than you would expect. Even though McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken wave, the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every penny. <br /> <br /> The Informer is a well-told tale about Ireland in a somber dark moment.
