Those who only remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to look up this charming piece of satire from the late 1960s. Ustinov plays a convicted crook (we first see him on his last day in prison, where he is preparing the governor's tax return) that, feeling that the future is in computers, poses (through a skillful piece of identity theft). a computer expert and is preparing to infiltrate an American multinational. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (who co-wrote the screenplay) is in top form, as is the charming Maggie Smith, here unusually climbing like an accident-prone cockney. sparrow dolly bird. Bob Newhart also makes a fun presentation as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfactorily despicable as the womanizing chief of Ustinov and Newhart. <br /> <br /> What do I particularly like about this movie? Not only is it a well-thought-out "capo" film, but it's also a touching little love story; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumble in love (the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective). <br /> <br /> So what's not to like? Well, the script is no more computer literate than most movies (that is, almost never), although it captures quite well the business computing feel of the great 1960s iron. There are also some minor flaws in the plot that you probably will not notice until the second or third preview, but I consider this to be a minor confusion. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie that is worth looking for, and once you have seen it once you will want to see it again at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
