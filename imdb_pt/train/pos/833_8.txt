First, let me say that the director has a wonderful use of titles in his photos. I really liked them. I really enjoyed this movie, but I have to say alongside Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is quite dull. Brosnan merges with this character so well, it's really hard to remember that this is the same guy who played bonuses. It also shows his reach and depth as an actor. It's kind of an indie movie and it was great to watch especially with all the movies that flood the movies at this time of year. I found the characters well crafted. The twist in the middle I felt was especially good. I also liked how realistic the characters are. So many times we have in the film these caricatures of people who are not really characters, but stereotypes walking ... I like the different approaches of this film. I think aside when I think of this movie, but I think this is more watchable and a better movie overall ...
