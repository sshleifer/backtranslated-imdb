I really enjoyed this show - we had the first and only, it seems, series in the UK on channel 4. The characterization was right about the money - a bit like the Simpsons in which all the different facets of the small town population were There was laughter - I had not seen it in an American TV comedy at the time except for Larry Sanders and it actually worked out well here, raising the hint that these crazy cops were really like that, not just the cameras. <br /> <br /> All in all, a small number that pleased me very well: I can not help thinking that maybe certain publics have lost their mark. I think it would have been a cult success in the UK if it had been shown at an acceptable time. <br /> <br /> I'll end with my standard comment: Where the hell can I get this to watch again? Any idea?
