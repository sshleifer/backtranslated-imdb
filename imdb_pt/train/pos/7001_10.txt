I've never commented on a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I read reviews saying that this movie stays with you. That happens. It's been almost 24 hours now, and I'm still completely affected. This movie left me questioning myself. How can I compare to a character like Ben who is totally unselfish? I love this movie I love movies that let me guess and think until the end. I feel two emotions predominantly, happiness and sadness. An incredible movie, good and very sad too. I really wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but in the end, they were forever. If you have not seen this movie yet, take it and watch it. Just make sure you have no distractions. You will want to see all the nuances of this photo. One for my library.
