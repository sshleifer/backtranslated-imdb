This is a little horror movie that indie movie fans will really enjoy. He has good acting, lots of courage and a decent story. One of them will be remembered of films like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It's obvious that the budget was not that great, but the film really pays off with the actors' atmosphere and solid performances, which seems to be missing in many of today's great special effects films. The film really moves and there is excellent direction and good camera work. There are no missed scenes, so the length of the movie is a bit short. Also, it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel, which would be very interesting as well. Then get some popcorn, turn off the lights and enjoy this one.
