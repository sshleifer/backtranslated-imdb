Domino is a great movie. It's about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle. She joins two fellow hunters (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez) and the adventures begin. The script is good. Very realistic and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I had with this movie is that it focuses on the different things they do instead of the Domino character. <br /> <br /> Even with this, Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. It shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance. Mickey Rourke follows his Oscar-Worthy performance in 'Sin City' with another tough-guy performance. Edgar Ramirez really does nothing but speak Spanish from time to time and look at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi gives a good supporting performance. Mo'Nique was herself, though she surprised me in one particular scene. Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie, though, is the direction. Tony Scott's fast-paced style really brings the film to life. Cinematography is one of the best I have ever seen. It takes a regular film and puts acid. All blacks are blacker, whites are brighter and have a kind of green glow. The action scenes are thrilling. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire, you'll like Domino.
