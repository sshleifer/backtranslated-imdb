For anyone who has judged others in the first meeting, here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character. The grumpy old woman has a soft, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. The fickle and insecure mistress who makes improper and uncomfortable comments sees deeply in her soul and has pure love for all. The cold, affectionate, correct, neglected wife has a tepid passion that can boil at any moment - given the right setting. Perfect beauty - rich, sweet, festive, pursued by multitudes - wants peace, tranquility, and love without possessiveness. <br /> <br /> By taking the time to look beyond the surface, you will find treasures in everyday life from the least expected sources. All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment.
