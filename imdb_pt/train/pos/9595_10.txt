At the beginning of this film, one of the commentators says he has been told that he has two attacks against him: he is black and masculine. But in addition, he has a third attack: he is gay. "You're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he is told. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about black men and gay Hispanics who are transvestites or transsexuals. The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that the director Jennie Livingston has a subject that could easily become a freak show and allows people in their humanity. We learn their visions of homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable that they are tragic. Many of the people are seriously in denial; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are scenes in this movie of naked transsexuals. If you have a problem with homosexuality then this movie is not for you. But if you see this movie, you will realize that "Paris is Burning" is not really about men wearing women's clothing, it's about a group of people who are routinely marginalized and dejected by society in general, and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991 because it says a lot: it's a commentary on materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about rich and poor people, about media and what it celebrates, about fame and adulation. "Paris is Burning" is one of the most humane and one of the saddest films I've ever seen.
