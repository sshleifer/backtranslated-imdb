There's nothing to dislike about Moonstruck. I'm from an Italian family in New York and I really miss it when I watch it. The actors and actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor ... they were all fantastic. It starts a little slow, but a lot happens in those two days! I fell in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. In my favorite movie list, Moonstruck is number 3. It's a "feel-good" movie, where you come out of the movies humming "amore" or repeating some of your favorite phrases: "old man, if you give these dogs another piece of my food, I'll kick you until you die "; "Chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who's dead", "you love him Loretta ....., good because when you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can." I always put Moonstruck when there is nothing good to watch because it makes me happy.
