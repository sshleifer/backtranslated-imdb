The main reason I wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast. A ton of my favorite actors in a movie is incredible without seeing it. But this movie took me by surprise. It was not what I expected. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember I could not stop laughing !!! And it was not just the cast that did it for me. The script was incredibly written. Every time you were expecting something to happen, it did not happen. There were so many twists and turns, but it fit the whole tone of the film instead of looking pretentious. The cinematography, along with the set, was absolutely beautiful too. I really can not say anything bad about this movie! Except, I would have Andrew Davoli a little more on screen!
