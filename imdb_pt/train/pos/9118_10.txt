I saw this movie with a special exhibition of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah. It's so interesting where this guy came from. Now he is probably the leading independent African filmmaker in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers, I'm talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture. The idea, if anything, attests to the diversity and variety of African themes, with his film 500 Years Later is an African issue. But the idea does not fit this mold. Showing the artistic diversity. The film is an entire African cast, but the topic is a human theme that most of us could relate to. I just love light comedy. And Tunde Jegede's Kora is amazing, it really is an art gem.
