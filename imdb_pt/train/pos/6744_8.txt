A hot-headed police officer accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers up the crime, but must deal with a guilty conscience while he tries to solve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney meet director Preminger in a noir film that is as effective as "Laura", their previous collaboration. Andrews is perfectly chosen as the serious cop, a good guy trapped in unfortunate circumstances. The acting is well everywhere, including Malden as a police captain and Tully as Tierney's protective father. The script of Hecht, a great and prolific writer, is tense and full of suspense, and Preminger creates a great atmosphere.
