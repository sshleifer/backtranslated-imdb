*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, since I'm a big fan of H: LOTS, maybe I've enjoyed the movie more than normal people. However, this movie is still excellent. He had tons of surprises, and gave a little more closing for the show. While I was sad that Bayliss had turned into a killer, the general feeling I felt was satisfied.
