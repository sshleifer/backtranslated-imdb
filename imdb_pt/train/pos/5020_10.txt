This is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of what is very surreal. He has this hazy tone that is rarely captured in the film, it seems like a dream sequence and it really takes you to a dark and scary memory. The children were extremely believable and I hope some things will come from them in the future. Very natural acting for these young people, I do not know if Bill took it from them or just that is good, but not less excellent. Bill scored as much as I'm concerned and to KevNJeff's comment about Mr. Paxtons poor performance, what can be done in that role. He played the role quite well in my opinion. Does this come from someone who said Hamlet was good (The Ethan Hawke Version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his Comments. Great movie to make you feel very uncomfortable, if that's what you want? The picture is above average as well.
