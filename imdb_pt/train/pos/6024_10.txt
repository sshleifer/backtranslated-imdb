I saw ZP when it was first released and I thought it was a big disappointment. His script seemed forced, arched and much talked about in the 1960s. It's far too advanced and ridiculous politics. And let's face it, I was still under a love spell known as BLOWUP: and I still have not completely shaken it. Now the "love" is distorted with every kind of nostalgia he evokes and, oh well. . . Good luck for me! <br /> <br /> But time goes on and time has been good for ZP and time has been a teacher to me. I revisit this movie about every ten years and it gets better and better with age. And the ZP is his own "experience" and is only really connected to BLOWUP through its creator, the late and great Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I was fortunate enough to see something absolutely pure. printed, designed in its correct size (immense), restored by an Italian government cultural agency that knows a good work of art when it sees it and knows the importance of keeping such a beauty thing in good shape. To this day I remember the audience's sigh as the first photo of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand-volt visual shock that Antonioni intentionally did to wake us up to a new level of consciousness. And, in fact, what follows from that point on is a completely different kind of "place." <br /> <br /> What's amazing to me is how this movie is coming true. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time I saw him - the early 80s - I began to feel affection for the film as a whole and for Daria and Mark in particular. Meanwhile, before these two looked like a smart dark version of Olivia and Leonard, of Zefferelli (read: Romeo and Juliet), now they were involving me - particularly The Girl, in their insistent slowness. She took her time. . . To live. Everything, everything dies around you. <br /> <br /> After the excitement of the theater, the daylight of Reality quickly began to erase my new "pleasure." The invasion of the 80's shoulders whispered "But this is a hippie fantasy - let it go" <br /> <br /> The strength of Antonioni's vision, I realized, already worked inside of me, FIRST Then I answered "80s "with a" Uh-Huh "and guarded my" love "secretly, possessively, and jealously. <br /> <br /> But that, then, is what good art lives within you. and if you want, you have your way and "love" you back: secretly, jealously, and possessively. And you have "changed". <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies decided to show ZP on its March show. Undoubtedly, the ZP should be seen on a giant screen so it can actually take it to the built environment. But sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimmer at all. <br /> <br /> Today reality hit, ZP was mysteriously withdrawn and replaced by the whiney antics of ALICE'S RESTAURANT So, it is still very "difficult", very "disturbing", also "what"? <br /> <br /> Maybe that's it, like all good art, everything dies around that. <br /> <br /> Peace.
