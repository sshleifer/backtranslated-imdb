In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried", Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Kriemhild seeks revenge. She marries Hagen, and through a series of events, eventually engages in a very drastic (but appropriate) action in the end. <br /> <br /> One of the things about watching this movie today is that we can look at certain portraits. Attila, the Hun (named Etzel in the film) is shown as the strange person from the east, possibly an allusion to the Soviet Union. Obviously, it was not Fritz Lang's fault that Hitler used "The Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what the FÃ¼hrer liked about the story. However, this is an absolutely formidable movie.
