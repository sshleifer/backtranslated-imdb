This is a fake language film from the start with a voice that mocks everything French and then produces a rather naive but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Pictured by the splendid Gerard Philippe, the dashing young man fully believes in the curvilinear fate that Lollobrigida announces - notably that he will marry the daughter of King Louis XV! The problem is that La Lollo soon discovers that she is also in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Boosted by good sword fights, horseback riding and other animated action scenes, the film moves at a fast pace and with many comics. moments. The direction is perhaps the weaker aspect, but the film is so light and takes itself so seriously that I could not think twice. Keep an eye on Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavyweight in French films, trying to steal La Lollo, becoming a nuisance and feeding the script to the fortune teller who reads the hand of La Lollo! And what a gem Marcel Herrand is like the megalomaniac and luxuriant king Louis XV! That's not all: so many beautiful women in a movie make me wish I was in France and set in 1952! The film may have come out that year, but its verve, cheek, excellent narration, immaculate photograph and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! Look!
