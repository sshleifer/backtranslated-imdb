at first I had the reaction that many people left after seeing this: that photos of fat people sunbathing, etc., were, in a way, taken cheap. Okay, so he's doing diane arbus picks up. . . whatever. . . but it did not take long for me to realize that this was not being done in an inhumane way as the images unfolded, I felt that the problem was entirely from the public: we are conditioned by Hollywood and also films from virtually everywhere we see people above of a certain age to behave in a sexual way is something inconvenient, something that should not be shown. if that were all the movie offered, it would be a great deal. however, the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and her drunken friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent narratives, incredible performances and the idea that the scene was improvised. This blond guy is a great actor. I finally want to contradict those who say that this movie is about how pathetic these people are. the old man who is in line with the woman who finally dances for him is quite an OK character who breaks this mold, so do not oversimplify the film by letting it go. Yes, your dog is dead. this is not a rosy picture of the world, but it is not. . . completely hopeless. anyway I felt very grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film. I would not say that each of the topics was as strong as the strongest, but I say that this film basically works out and would recommend it a lot. . .
