This movie is being described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy. Like any Panahi movie, it was a very realistic drama that portrays the common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much lighter than the director's dark and serious circle (my favorite Iranian movie). The girls' resourcefulness and play between them and the soldiers was completely believable (as if it were a documentary) and completely hilarious. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the match and the aftermath were amazing. He added a realism very much like Kenny from Australia, of course, a very different film. <br /> <br /> The performances of all non-professional actors ?? soldiers and girls? were very credible. It was very touching to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks that Muslim girls using a chador are different from their own daughters, should you go see this movie? will be a true eye opener. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm. They started with official standard stock policy responses for all girls' requests. As the film progressed, they found it increasingly difficult to maintain that stance. When what appears to be all of Teheran erupts into unbridled celebrations, everyone is involved in it, and the ridicule of current policies is obvious to everyone. <br /> <br /> It was a very touching and unexpected ending. and gave the film a really nice mix of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although it is an adult movie theater, I think mature kids of about seven years old would really appreciate this movie (as long as they can read subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran is able to read. producing films of such quality by the likes of Panahi and Kiarostami. Maybe the restraints force the directors to be extremely resourceful. Australian filmmakers (and others) could take a sheet out of the book.
