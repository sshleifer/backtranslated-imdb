Yes, a true classic! This is what British drama, realism, and the minimal use of special effects (and inflated budgets) are all about. I saw this drama for the last time when it was last screened on British terrestrial TV in 1994. It really should be seen by everyone who likes a scary plot with no big names but not so-minus-great acting. copywrite now belongs to someone unknown and as such, it is unlikely that this great drama will be transmitted anytime soon. I myself recently bought The Woman In Black on VHS, so now, once again, I can enjoy this great British drama. You should try and enjoy it too! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
