In a way, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg in the grinding machine? Whoopi zoned tranquilizers? Whoopi as Blind Lemon and imitating Mick Jagger? Great moments captured in the movie for sure, but the movie still sucks, right? That's how I feel about "Rich In Love". A man hears his wife sing for the first time. Post-coitus adolescents talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney eats ice cream in the bucket and, in another scene, has a beautiful moment of vigil in relation to his absent wife. Alfre Woodard adds another colorful character to his acting costume. But there is only the whisper of a plot here and you can not wait for it to move. Only when The Graces of Charlotte Caffey's ex-Go-Gos lights up a great pop song does the picture wake up ... and then it's over! <br /> <br /> This photo is the equivalent of a lazy summer day in the deep South American.
