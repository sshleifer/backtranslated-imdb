This film documents a transformative experience for a group of young people, and the experience of seeing it is itself transformative for the viewer. Few films aspire to this level of transcendence, and I can not think of any other film - documentary or drama - that reaches for it. There's no other movie I've had so much laughed at and cried so much. Yes, it's about DMD and affordable travel; Only on such issues is it a worthwhile venture, but it's more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, about living every day that you're alive. And it's a great fun and adventurous storytelling. That's why God created the cinema! Watch this movie !!!
