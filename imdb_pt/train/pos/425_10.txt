I would like to comment on the movie April Love. It's one of my all-time favorites, because my dad, Nelson Malone, plays the horse trainer. I distinctly remember when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were living at the time to do April Love. My father had participated in countless plays and was a talented man. I talked to him to try one of the small parts offered, and behold he came home with the script. How exciting is that! In addition, some of my colleagues were in the crowd scenes - especially those shown at the amusement park. It's very nostalgic every April, when I watch the movie show again, and Pat Boone's April Love song is still played on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of a time gone by when you see the movies they do today with all sex, dirty language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back to focus ...
