Simply put, Oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. It's full of memorable songs - "Food Glorious Food," "Oliver !," "Consider It," and "Oom-Pah-Pah," to name just a few - and equally memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel and much like the story of Oliver Twist himself, it is a perfect family movie. There are some scary moments - villain Bill Sykes, played by Oliver Reed, is pretty scary on its own - but overall, the film will appeal to children of all ages, as well as adults. <br /> <br /> The story - which almost everyone is already familiar with - revolves around a little orphan named Oliver and his life growing up in London. At first he lives in the asylum with the rest of his orphans, but after daring to question Mr. Bumble, the superintendent, he is sold to a family as an employee. After a series of setbacks and close to beard, he meets the Artful Dodger - superbly played by a young Jack Wild, who gives his all on paper - and through him, the greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who trains boys to choose pocket treasures he keeps for himself The film was filmed only in studios and studios at Shepperton Film Studios, but that does not translate into anything for the movies. The scenarios perfectly reproduce Victorian London, as well as the costumes worn by the characters. A multi-Oscar winner and a huge success at his release, Oliver! is a worthy contender for the best musical all the time and will delight anyone who loves film.
