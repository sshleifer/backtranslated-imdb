Lost is not the biggest TV show in history, but it's not far off. It does not have the plot or characterization of The West Wing or possibly even early ER, however it is undoubtedly the most exciting show continuously that I have ever seen. I love the way I can not guess what's going to happen. I love the recounting of characters' background stories, which often give rise to new dimensions so we can see them. In a way, I want the program to last forever, but I think they can take 6-7 seasons of it. before they have to end in a glorious high. The combination of the characters and their nationalities, combined with the fluidity of the show to move forward and back, thus extending the dead characters - "life span" - all adds to the feeling that this show is something very different from what we are accustomed to. It's captivating, surprising and (here's a little hint to all of you conspiracy theorists) more than a little interactive - keep discussions on the Internet working - you're only adding to the plot ...
