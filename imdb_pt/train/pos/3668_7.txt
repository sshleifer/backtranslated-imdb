I recently saw this movie and I really liked it. gives insight into indie film production and how much work is actually involved when you have a low budget but need an actor / actress name to get people, anyone to see it and give exposure to the movie. Bobby Myeres played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder make a great combination by finding the eccentric Miachel Bates, an actor "NAME" played by Alan Bates was a perfect decision in the movie and the movie. My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan played by the magnificent and underrated Debra Kara Unger with her own special performance again in the movie within the film. If you like to think when watching a comedy, then this is for you. The low budget meets the lowest budget with high laughter content.
