Let me just get to the bottom line here: I have 3 kids, ages 5 to 10. I consider a trip to the theater a hit when there are no talking animals. I've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the film is reversed in The Wizard of Oz, the sexual joke over 18 years in El Dorado and the tragic failure with the end of Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer. I could probably storyboard Nemo from memory alone. <br /> <br /> What makes me support my son (varies), who suggests this title for the film of the family of a night? In one word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> Moment of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
