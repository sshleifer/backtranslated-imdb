Robert Wuhl is teaching a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. It covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer well-known in general. I would like to see a lot more of this show. It is very fun. Wuhl uses examples and "show and tell" to convey his points. He explained that the person who actually set up Paul Revere's midnight drive was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Revere's name because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> I watched Robert Wuhl for many years from the time he was doing stand-up comedy and all the way up to "Arli $$" on HBO. He's a good actor and a good comedian, but he is an excellent teacher! I recommend you watch an episode of this show. Well worth your time.
