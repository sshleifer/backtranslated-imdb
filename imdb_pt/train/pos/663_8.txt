I watched this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it's very nice. And it's rather scary, but all in good and macabre fun. A woman kills her second husband, but is faced with a problem when a maniac escaped in a ragged Santa Claus costume decides to pay a visit to her and her girl at that very moment. Mary Traynor, who I remember from SNL or some other TV comedy show, is the evil wife, and Larry Drake plays the lunatic in Santa's outfit. I had forgotten that Santa was interpreted by Drake over the years. Your Santa Claus is an unstoppable force and quite scary at times. You can probably guess how Santa finally enters the house. The episode is played for laughs, but it can also be quite intense at times.
