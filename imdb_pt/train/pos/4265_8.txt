If you have not seen this charming little obscure, you should look for it. It's the story of Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray), who is listed in 4-F every time he tries to enter any branch of the military. He finds a magical lamp that of course contains a genius (Gene Sheldon), but the genius is even more bumbling than MacMurray is, sending him through time to serve at all times and places wrong than the one he wants . It is beautiful, cheerful and pure, and you can not help liking it. The plot is much like a Disney movie, especially since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) made several Disney movies in the 50s and 60s, though not together. Needless to say, everything goes well for everyone, and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good.
