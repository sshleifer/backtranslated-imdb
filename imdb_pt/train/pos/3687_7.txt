Greetings again from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated stickers about love in the city of lights. A very unusual format that takes some segments to fit as viewer. We're so accustomed to character development over a 2-hour movie, it's kind of disarming for this to take place in an 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea is 18 love / relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city. Of course, some stand up better than others and some prefer comedy while others focus on dramatic emotion. Some well-known directors are involved, including: Brothers Coen, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many familiar faces also appear: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowland, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments involves a treat, and then another treat and the young nerdy son, but happy of the two pampering. Also playing key roles are a red coat, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other topics. Do not miss Alexander Payne (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the segments makes it interesting to watch, but as a movie, can not be considered great. It is still very watchable and a good change of pace for the frequent movie goer.
