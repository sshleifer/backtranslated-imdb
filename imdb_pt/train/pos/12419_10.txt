I love this movie like no other. On another occasion, I will try to explain your virtues to the uninitiated, but let me, for the time being, quote some of the pieces of the remarkable dialogue, which, please remember, is all ironic. Aussies and Poms will understand, everyone else as well? <br /> <br /> (lyrical song title) "he can sink a beer, he can choose a stranger, in his latest Bondi gear pierced." </ P> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> <br /> <br /> (during an interview on television on an "artistic program": Mr. Mackenzie what have the artists impressed you most since you were in England? (while talking to a naive young girl): Mr. Mackenzie, I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants in Australia? (Barry's reply) Abos? I've never seen a Abo in my life. makes most of the solid yakca (ie, hard work) around our place. <br /> <br /> This is just one example of the hilarious farce of this most beautiful Australian movie.If you can get a copy, watch and enjoy.
