Damn, that was too much to absorb. I was practically hypnotized everywhere. It was pretty perfect, though I would say the issue had a lot to do with it. I can not believe this guy has stayed in good relation with their lot (Anton especially) to get all these pictures without any serious ... steak. The Dandy went well together, middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, which perhaps was not what many other people felt. Great piece of cinema and great choice of subject (s). I recommend this to any music / movie fan. You'll probably learn something about filming.
