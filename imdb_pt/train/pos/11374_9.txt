There are some great comments and remarks about this movie. I was pleased to note the comparisons with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the aborted remake of the 1950s with David Wayne). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (extraordinarily good performance of Jeffery DeMunn), taking away his sexually frustrated rage from his victims - most of them children. He is the goal. The real villain is the stifling Soviet bureaucratic system, drowned in its own corrupt incompetence. The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in his best role since "The Crying Game"), a pragmatic easy-to-use system in his favor (Sutherland always successful in such a role), a hesitant, frightened but determined . psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), the awkward bureaucrat boopous of a promoter (the brilliant British actor John Wood) and the silent support wife of the researcher (the nice defender, Imelda Staunton). This is a great movie. Their darkness and coldness are supported by the depiction of a corrupt and incompetent system that works against success. There is no need to dive into the sensationalism of the blood slices that characterized so many recent films. Gore is present - it's a horrible story - but it adds to the description of a pathologically twisted human being. The success of the story is precisely this: these were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or me. Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo has taken away his anger from the most innocent and vulnerable of us. , our children. The excellent premise of this story is manifested by an equally excellent cast of excellent actors. "Unfortunately, I notice that our Australian friend did not like the speech, and I certainly would have preferred to hear him speaking in the Australian dialect. Well, very bad. This good movie certainly worked for me and all the others I talked to.
