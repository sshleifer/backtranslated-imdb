This is a cute and sad story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who fled to California to escape a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese-American handyman with aspirations for rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner. Kyoko "home" with Ken to be able to stay permanently in the US, with the understanding that although they live together until they receive a green card, the marriage will be only in name. It soon develops that the parts are not on the same wavelength - or maybe in the same "time zone," hence the movie title. As an immigration lawyer, I saw these "arrangements" come to life, so I was happy to see how the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
