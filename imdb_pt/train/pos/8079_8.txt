Not many reviews, hence I thought I'd add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO FOR OTHER EVALUATIONS! This was a great movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can really put together a really good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay gave another example of great success. acting as well as bhoomika too, which was a bit unexpected but great to watch. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised there has not been much hype around the launch. <br /> <br /> Or filmfare / other awards nominations, considering how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> Better then Khakee I thought and I thought that Khakkee was also a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a very long movie, but it's definitely worth it and while watching it definitely seems long. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for the next RKS movie and the next AB movie, Akshay, they always seem to get along well together ... for example waqt. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika has also acted very well in the film and should do very well if it continues in the same way in the future.
