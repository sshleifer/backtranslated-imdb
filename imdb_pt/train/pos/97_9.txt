this was a favorite Christmas special that I would like them to release on vhs or dvd, since my 33 RPMs have been lost, and any cassette I've done is gone too long. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a big John fan of Denver, but was very impressed with the music, which was mostly traditional favorites with a spin muppet (Little St. Nick!) It also contained a few little-known songs ( original?). <br /> <br /> Although it was done in the late 70's this show had a timeless feel for it. Hoping to find a copy soon !!!
