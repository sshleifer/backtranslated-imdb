This movie is great. His setback probably in the 40's and the character of Meg Ryan strives to be known as "smart." Also, Tim Robbins is so cute in this movie. And all about it has a magical feeling about it. Every time I watch I feel happy. It's definitely a girl's movie and I'm a girl, so I like that. I also love music. The violin is incredible. but besides that I think it's a cute story and everyone should watch it.
