I thought "The River of Souls" was a great Babylon 5 movie, with some exceptional performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this was an episode of the series (without humor), it would probably be one of my favorite stories in the series. Personally, I always preferred Scoggins to Christian, although JMS granted her not too much of the series and she had to endure the plot Byron / Telepath. If you get the dirty humor about the brothel and the "poorer" actors in those scenes, then this movie is something solid. Probably my third favorite of all four movies, but not at all bad.
