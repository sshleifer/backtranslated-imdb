I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's an incredible movie. Very disturbing. <br /> <br /> In a way, Zero Day is very comparable to "The Blair Witch Project". It is shot entirely with portable camcorders. It's about 2 kids. Just your ordinary kids. Andre and Calvin. They start a campaign against the High School called "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> The whole story is told in the Video Diary form of the two children. This shows that there are relationships with parents, among others, showing that these are just normal children, as well as people we know or bump into. We have discovered that the Army's last mission of 2 will be titled Day Zero. They plan to shoot there in high school. <br /> <br /> You see how they have access to these weapons, how they plan it all. They emphasize that the media did not affect them in any way, and there is no reason for it. As I said, all this is counted in the Video Diary format, and then they store the tapes in a safe to be seen after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> The actual footage is shown through Survillence cameras throughout the school. . Chilling indeed. The movie is very creepy. Some of the things they say, how they plan it, you would have to see for yourself. One quote I remember is the only time that Calvin is alone. He says, "Andre thinks they're going to get out on some escape car by doing this for various schools across the country. I do not know what he's thinking, but the only way I get out of school is in a plastic bag black". "<br /> <br /> I'm probably not even giving you the correct idea of ​​this movie. <br /> <br /> You really need to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> It's happening around festivals now.
