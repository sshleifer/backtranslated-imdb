This film is an incredible and uninterrupted laugh that incorporates all the usual ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - clumsy heroes, supporting characters, invented dolls for heroines, nasty villains, cuties, rock soundtrack + choreography, and a small dose of action. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are both in double roles of cops and crooks. Amitabh's heroine, the cop, is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposed to police officer Govinda. Heroines are mere dirty roaring props as usual. Con artists have no heroines. Paresh Rawal carries his villainous act in DAUD forward (he also made a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines on a brief paper. He does a resumption in his famous "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer" in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is as flawless as ever - like a playful and humorous cop, Phaare Mohan, and as a con man Chhote Miyaan. He imitates the Bihari style of Hindi speaking with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, pales in comparison to him. But still the AB is fine. Madhuri Dixit plays a special part in the song "Makhna". She dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> The music of Viju Shah is incredible. Check out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Do not go after any LOGIC, as it is a comedy and the script is of convenience. Just enjoy yourself.
