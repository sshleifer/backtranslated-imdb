Obviously, a film that had great influence not only on the genre of friends but also on the genre of action. George Lucas had to be a fan of this film, since much of his Star Wars series seems like a tribute to Gunga Din. The characters Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks play are just precursors to Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din has turned into C-3PO and R2-D2 and likes it or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today this movie is seen as not PC, but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru. the Indian opposition leader to the British raj who could be echoed in the feelings of many today. <br /> <br /> For a boy, this was a great movie. Three strong male leads and just a touch of romance. There was a time when young boys considered kissing the girl in Saturday's movie matinee. Not like today when most skin is greeted with pleasure. Too late to mourn the lost innocence. <br /> <br /> I hope this film is not forgotten and some who are surfing the channel stop at TCM and watch a movie with action, adventure and a cast of thousands instead of CGI. actors
