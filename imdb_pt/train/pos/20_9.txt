Stanley and Iris show the triumph of the human spirit. For Stanley, it is the struggle to become literate and realize its potential. For Iris, it is to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda make together, starting and stopping, before each one has the skills and the courage to completely trust each other and move on. In that sense, it very well gives us a good view of how life is often, and thus credible. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the characters that were rendered to be consistent across the image. The support cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character as the main characters are added from the supporting performances. All in all an excellent movie. The best thing that I shot is hope.
