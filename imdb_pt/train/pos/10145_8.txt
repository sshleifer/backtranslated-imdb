This is a charming old fashioned movie. The venues are great and the situation is of those old Preston Sturgess films. Fi you want to watch a movie that does not require much else then to sit back and relax then this is it. The performance is good and I really enjoyed Michael Rispoli. He was in Rounders too. And while you slept. The rest of the cast is fun. This is exactly what happens when two people about to get married know what they really love over the weekend that they are planning their own marriages. I know ... it sounds crazy ... but it is. And that's what makes it fun to watch. It'll make your girlfriend hug or leave you, but at least you'll know.
