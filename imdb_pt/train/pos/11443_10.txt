This film is fascinating in its beauty and creativity. The deep vision of an artist, his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring Hosanna, blending his creations with trees, white water running against rocks, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy to be alive , conscious that we are all made from the clay of this glorious land. It does not save us from its occasional frustration, but in general we see the miracle in uniting art with nature. The credit is also clear for filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and timing perfect. <br /> <br /> If you have some feeling of beauty, nature and art ... do not miss this fantastic movie!
