In my years attending film festivals, I have seen many smaller movies like this that are never distributed in theaters, and they end up in the $ 3 boxes at WalMart. I just found Yank Tanks DVD there, great doc, but how sad for it to end up as a rest from the bottom of the pit. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, I wish I had seen it in the movies on is everything. I'd rather New Yorker Films translate the title directly. It's good that Americans stretch out a little. If the title of the film helps the American public to explore random chaos, better yet. Cinema imitates life and vice versa. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found it was a distraction that the subtitles put the prices in dollars. Let's go! The euro is not hard to figure out, make the gringo public do the math. When watching a movie, especially one filmed in Paris, the viewer should not have the spoiled effect when being reminded: I am an American watching a movie and they are translating Euros into dollars for me. <br /> <br /> Eager to see more of these actors and more from the writer and director as well.
