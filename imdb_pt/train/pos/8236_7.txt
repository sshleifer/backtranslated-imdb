Due to the invention of a "The Domestication Collar", flesh-eating zombies are controlled and become productive members of society; however, they perform household chores. The dead servises cater to those who live in small towns surrounded by the 1950s, while untamed zombies roam the "Wild Zone." In "Willard", pre-teen K'Sun Ray (as Timmy Robinson) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (as Helen and Bill Robinson). Unfortunately, the Robinsons are the only family on the street who does not have a zombie; its new neighbors, the Bottoms, have six. So to follow, the Robinsons get the zombie Billy Connolly (as Fido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Connolly's "Domestication Collar" is damaged by an old lady's walker, and he eats it; so new and hungry zombies infest the city. Meanwhile, young Ray has become attached to Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like "Timmy and Lassie") and the Robinson family finds it difficult to cooperate with the "Zomcom" authorities. <br /> <br /> "Fido" does not go far enough in its intriguing "Wild Zone"; but it's a colorful addition, elegantly and playfully satirical to the folklore of zombie movies. Ray and the cast do well, individually; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis), the most memorable pair. Director Andrew Currie and his team, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music) and James Willcock (design), deservedly won awards. <br /> <br /> Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ Ray K'Sun, Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
