I always enjoy watching movies that make you think, and not only feed the responses to their audience. "Revolver" is one of those films, and although many critics have stated that it is difficult to follow, with a little concentration and an open mind, I succeeded. First time. It's true that it does not compare to other liars like "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento", but, per se, it's a clever and thought-provoking film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is how beautiful it is. Each scene, every angle of the camera seems to have been thought for centuries. If you see, you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude ... watch it with an open mind and you will be able to enjoy it. If not, well, no one has ever said that "Revolver" is for everyone. And that's my 2 cents.
