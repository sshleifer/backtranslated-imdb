I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it. The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious. Another highlight of the film is definitely the song, which we hope will be released soon. I recommend it to everyone who likes British humor and especially to all musicians. Go and see. It's great.
