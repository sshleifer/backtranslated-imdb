Yes, the poster is a pretty awful job. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was good ... nothing really striking ... I just hoped it was a hardcore junkie life. <br /> <br /> Ahh, but this can not happen to rich kids right now, can you? Not for the son of a wealthy businessman who performs large ballroom parties and has a beautiful well-kept lawn in front of the mini-mansion. <br /> <br /> No ... the boy is too good to have his life totally destroyed. . After all, who will drive the new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, the poor and rich children ... in their picturesque beautiful house, with its ivory league schools, ultra clean houses and socialites ... what will the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope you all get addicted to drugs, spend your life and end up in jail ... then maybe we can watch movies that do not revolve around the poor rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
