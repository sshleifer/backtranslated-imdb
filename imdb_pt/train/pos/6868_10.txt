I saw this in Detroit in what must have been his original race. I literally rolled into the hall of the theater. It was so funny. I have not seen it since, but I'd love to. Where do you get a copy? Someone saying something about being dated or exaggerated is, for my money, just a bunch of poseurs. Each piece is evil, erotic or perversely hilarious. Each one! There is not a weakness included. The opening sequence, for example, which parodies 2001, features gum-dancing gorilla dancers with pendant breasts. Felinni would have filmed if he had the wicked wit ... If you come to this movie with an open mind and a contemptuous and scornful heart, you will write it on your best list.
