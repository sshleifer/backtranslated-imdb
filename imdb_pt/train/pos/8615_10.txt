I waited for this movie to go out for a while in Canada, and when I finally did, I was very excited to see it. I really liked that. Of course, in the beginning, it's a very sad movie (and it was New Year's Day - making it even sadder) - however, it stays with you. The next day I was thinking about it again, because although this revolves around something so emotionally exhausting, you realize after a few days it's such a beautiful story. As a person can be seen as the link to so many people, but sometimes you can go blind with so many things. And how Diane Keaton's character saves the rest just by being there. And how they save it in the process too. It was a great movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) offers the perfect comic relief. It's definitely a movie that's going to need a tissue box, but it's going to be a long time with you.
