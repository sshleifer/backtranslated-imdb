If the creators of this film had made any attempt to introduce reality into the plot, it would have been just another waste of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, throwing all the pretension of reality to the winds, they created a comic marvel. Who could pass up a movie in which an alien pilot passes the entire movie acting like Jack Nicholson, complete with the Lakers jersey. Do not discard this film as junk.
