This is an EXCELLENT example of Bette Davis' initial talent. Production is above average for the period of 1936. I can not understand why the rights owners on this film did not put it on DVD. Owners, PLEASE, please release it. I would buy immediately. I have not seen this for more than thirty years on television, but I remember that very well.
