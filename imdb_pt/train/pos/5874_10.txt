this movement was hilarious !!! Funnier than I've seen in a while, akshay and john kick ass like always, and the puppies are hot too. the story is incredible, many great jokes, and whoever reviewed it before me is an idiot. to him I say that you are not of Indian origin, then you would not understand the idiot mood. Do not rate movies you do not understand. What did you watch, the caption version where most of the jokes are lost in the translation? that's what i thought jackass. akshay kumar is the best actor of all time and once again proves his versatility, he can do not only action but also comedy, and is excellent at it. John proved himself too, this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it.
