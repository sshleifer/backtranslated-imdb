One of the most sensible comedies to hit the Hindi movie screens. A remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, which in turn was a remake of the 60s Hollywood hit of the same name, Garam Masala elevates the pattern of comedies at Hindi Cinema. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar once again proved that he is one of the best Hindu movie super stars that can do comedy. It matched well with the new heartthrob John Abraham. However, John still remains in the shadows of Akshays and can not get to the occasion. <br /> <br /> The new girls are cute and do complete justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> You have to watch comedies. Leave your brain away and laugh for 2 hours !! After all, laughter is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
