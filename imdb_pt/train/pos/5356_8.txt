Running Man is not a great movie, actually it's kind of silly. But deliver what you want in an Arnie movie and that's action and entertainment. I do not see how anyone could not appreciate this image, it's so silly and exaggerated, it almost makes fun of itself. By the way, this is probably one of Arnie's most quoteable films out there.
