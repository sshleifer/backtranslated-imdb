According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It's a bit difficult to take these Mats Helge movies seriously, as most of their films are filmed on a very tight budget. Almost no USD at all. But it is fascinating to establish that Mats Helge finally concludes something that can be called an action movie. The Ninja Mission is - I think - the best of all the films directed by him. Some special effects are quite nice. This is not a "B" or "C" movie. It's a "Z" movie - but a fun and fun "Z" movie!
