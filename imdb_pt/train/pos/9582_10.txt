After growing up in the dark streets of Detroit, MI, and having friends who traveled to New York dances, I fell into the lifestyle of being a member of the House. I joined the House of Theieves. We adapted the same rules as most houses, but we were professional cheaters who increased and committed credit card fraud to get the fabulous jewelry and clothes we wanted. I even learned to profess check-writing and driver's license and to trade them in over seventeen states, until a jealous queen called the Secret Service for me and I went to federal prison. But I've learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I recommend that you watch yourself. You can even read about how I grew up in the houses here in Detroit and the criminal activity in which we surrender. My book, Identity Schemes is on sale at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com. But trust me, it's a lot better than Paris is Burning, because it's a 2005 brand.
