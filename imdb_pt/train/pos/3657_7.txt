This movie is like a 1950 version of Brutti sporchi and cattivi by Ettore Scola. Less sex and less realism, but a tale with great humanism and warmth. I would not call it a neo-realist photo. It is very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and should probably be classified as a comedy, although it deals with serious subjects (a bit like Chaplin or comedy from 1930). Typical Italian, however, very emotional and difficult to resist except for a cold stone person. Sentimentality is a disappointment, although this image was not a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it's a lovely, hilarious comedy with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
