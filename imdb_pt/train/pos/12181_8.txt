"The Lady from Shanghai" is known as one of Hollywood's most problematic productions. Welles' original cut was removed by the producers and cut into ribbons. This made the already complicated mystery story even harder to keep up with. They posted a good deal of their dialogue because of the density of the Irish accent, and the dubbing is very apparent and poorly made. Most disastrous of all, Welles and his real-life protagonist and leader, Rita Hayworth, were crumbling in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry appears onscreen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all of this is overcome. The fantastic direction of Orson Welles is. It makes the film incredibly elegant and atmospheric - each scene seems to be breathing on its backs across the screen. In addition, the characters and scenes are so bizarre that they border on dreams and surrealists. This sense of strangeness elevates scenes that are often found in these films, like the sequences of the court in the middle. I usually find court dramas boring, but Welles' direction and quirky touches make them as fascinating as anything. The finale at the carnival is a bit like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> The performance here is also very good. Despite their failed relationship, Welles and Hayworth give decent performances - their interactions, however, are somewhat lacking. Everyone is superb and delightful to watch, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The Lady from Shanghai" obviously has its problems, but it's worth watching just to see one of the movie masters at its best. (8/10)
