This is one of the unusual cases in which a film and the novel on which it is based are great. Perhaps it is because Gorris "takes the initial ideas of Nabokov and gives them a different interpretation. The final consequence is a view on Lujin that dignifies him more than Nabokov's. film that I do not like is the influence of Valentinov in Luzhin's fate.I can not imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him such a big influence on the novel's argument.
