I just bought the DVD and I must say, (after seeing Brazil and Fear a disgust in Las Vegas) Terry does it again. In addition to being a fan of the Monty Python films, Terry Gilliam's genius follows in this sci-fi thriller, to which Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and also (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt, who played the insanity of Jefferey Goines. A must have for sci fi fans, or movie fan of any kind really, because it includes suspense, drama, action, etc. <br /> <br /> In any future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease destined to eliminate the human race, which is unleashed in the past by the "army of twelve monkeys." James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus was released) to find out about the disease, so scientists in their time can find a cure. Before going any further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and animals dominate the world on the surface because of the disease that will kill humans. anyway, when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his stories to the virus people. During his stay, he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who later is responsible for ending the human race. He also meets his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe) who eventually joins Bruce to save the world (as she sees he is correct in his reports), he is sent from his time to the past and finally sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity, but then tries to reveal a final suspense of the film and then comes to a rather shocking climax where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus (not actually Brad Pitt) and is instead shot. the murderer runs away.
