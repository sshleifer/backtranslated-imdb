MPAA: R rated for violence, language, nudity, and brief drug use. Quebec Rating: 13+ Home Video Canada Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today.This movie is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight.After watching Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more movies of Bashki Eu I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw it. When it was released, the film was very controversial. It was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film to be banned, he even led protests in front of the theater where the film was. The film was only released on VHS under the title "Street Fight." Today it is considered a cult classic and African-American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and rap group The Wu-Tang Clan. said I have liked this film. I personally think Fritz The Cat was a much better film but this is very nice too. It draws attention to the Bashki or Blaxploitation movie fans. The movie mixes live action and animation more or less like the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit.I would have preferred in full animation but wh The film starts with a reverend and another man running to rescue two of his friends from prison. While the prisoners wait, the oldest tells the story of three men he met. The film then changes to animation format, we see three black people who sold their house to this man. They decide to make their names in Harlem. So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a great player in Harlem and he basically becomes a big target. The film continues as the Italian mafia. The mafia involves the godfather, his three homosexual children and an Italian clown. Coonskin is a fun animated film that is worth checking out if you can find it.
