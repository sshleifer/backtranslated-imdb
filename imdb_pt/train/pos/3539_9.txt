Good: engaging cinematic shootings, great presentation, vehicles are really fun to drive, multiplayer quite appealing, faithful to the movie, and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: the main missions are a bit short. <Br /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" sniper is in the third person (not necessarily a spy game). Great shootings continue the story and make you want to complete EVERY single mission, and unlock all the genuine bonuses that the game has to offer. The hype that this game had, was lived, and I personally think you should buy it, and stick with a couple of friends and play that one. Lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is a devastating achievement of some previous bonus games, and firing a gun, it really looks like you're firing a gun. This goes with the fact that you are a deadly, relentless spy. <br /> <br /> Overall, this game leaves you excited and satisfied after winning, and a multiplayer mode that can compete with the standards of the crafty James Bond "Nightfire" gamecube game.
