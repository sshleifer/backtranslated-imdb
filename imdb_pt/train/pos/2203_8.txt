I also loved this series when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 years old and my family always attended this show. My favorite character was the one played by Marion Lorne as a rather stuttering, clumsy and very kind aunt. I can still recall her comments "ubba bubba a one" as she would try and say something important. And then, when she came back and played Aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was a great casting! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I remember seeing Walter Matthau, whose career I have been a fan of for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question if anyone can check: the title or credits final song "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear it play on my classic radio station here in Southern California, it brings back memories of Mr. Peepers' image going away with his back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this image in my mind is correct.
