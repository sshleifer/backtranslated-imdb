Until I saw this special on HBO, I had never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I'm glad I have it now! He's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen! Rarely has a comedian completely immersed himself in his craft then Eddie. I could not stop laughing at the whole show. If you like to laugh, you have to see it special!
