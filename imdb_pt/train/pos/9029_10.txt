I saw this movie a few days ago. This movie is so good that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad you've always dreamed about it - you can have it. This shows a great desire being realized through happiness and sorrow, without hope and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, you can do different things and be happy.
