Soylent Green I found an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's Run, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting may be somewhat better described as "tacky" but the story is excellent. <br /> <br /> The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant. <br /> <br /> In the end, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story unfolded in an easy and easy rhythm. <br /> <br /> The closest equivalent of modern day would be "Dark Angel" in terms of how the US is shown to be a third world country.
