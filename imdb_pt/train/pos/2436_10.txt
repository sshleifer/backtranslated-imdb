Usually I like something light and fun, so this movie should not have attracted me. But it caught me from the beginning. The story of a family's choices and challenges seems obvious, but raises the question repeatedly, "What if it was my family? My choice?" I cried and laughed when they did because I really felt what the people involved felt. It was in places hard to watch but harder to get away from. The story is true and life is sometimes hard to watch! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: a good story is a good story in itself. The best and most unpredictable stories are true. Like in real life, you really do not know what's going to happen next, or why people do the things they do!
