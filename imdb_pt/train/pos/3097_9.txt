This show was Fabulous. It was intricate and well written and all the characters were nice to be terribly sweet. Even Jonathan Cake, the flirting boyfriend, was nice. Since our waves are littered with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was cool to see a drama that was not much like a novel. It has always been intriguing to see how each character would be linked to the next circumstance. It's really annoying that we finally have a show that makes you think a bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of us do not even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. This show will be lost, perhaps not by many people but by some very loyal fans.
