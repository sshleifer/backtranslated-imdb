Me and my girlfriend, Annette, we saw this together and we'll both discuss it. <br /> <br /> We both really enjoyed watching this, despite having taken some liberties with Dicken's work. Many of Dicken's plays are somewhat somber and somber (including Oliver Twist), but this movie has changed all that. It was fun, colorful (both visually and musically), and the characters were more cheerful. TRAVIS: Normally, I do not care much about musical and dance films, but the songs in this production were captivating and lively, and the choreography was incredible. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: That really says a lot about Travis. I can not emphasize how good the dance numbers were. You could say, for example, that those kids really worked hard to get their routines down to perfection. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Three actors really stood out IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reed can really make a good villain. That scene where you see his eyes in the mail gave me chills in the back ... INCREDIBLE. And that boy Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (dude, I felt bad when she was killed). She can sing too! Congratulations to the casting department for your choices. I hated the boy Oliver Twist tho. He was very tearful and weak for my taste. (I kept hoping Bill Sikes would throw him into the mud during the chase scene.) And they should not have sung him too. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Acting was really superb. In addition to the three stars Travis mentioned, I felt that Ron Moody (Fagin) did a tremendous job. He was so funny and at the same time slightly sinister as well. The supporting actors were also great. Harry Secombe took his Mr. Bumble role very well. And he has a wonderful voice. I saw Mr. Secombe performing in another movie titled "Davy," where he played an opera singer with pleasing results. The talented Harry Secombe should have made many more films. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, the story is not quite true to the book, but the IMO was more robust. This movie was not boring, as some musicals seem to be. And continuity kept you moving along with the characters. The melodies did not diminish the plot or put him to sleep for being very long. <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: Any musical movie that Travis watches over completely has to be a rare find. And this is really a rare find. It's a very easy-to-watch production that takes the viewer smoothly and entertaining to the end. On a day when all the movies seem to be effects combined with beautiful faces, this was a refreshing interlude. <br /> <br /> Our combined rating for this was 8.5 out of 10. (rounded up to 9 in this case TRAVIS: I rated this as a 7 mostly because boy Oliver Twist (Mark L.) irritated me, and <br /> <br /> ANNETTE: My rating is 10. Films do not get much better than that.And you can tell the all involved in this production that really worked hard to make it what it was ... a masterpiece. Please do not miss this ... even if you do not usually like musicals. rare treat.
