Sorry to say that I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Of course give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood think they can cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please do not entertain us what we really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting more. I was looking around to see when I was leaving. It was like a terrible joke. The charts in which the plot of the story seemed solid and had all the hallmarks of a great movie. Unfortunately that will not happen for now. For the producers, directors and all the actors great work, but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more.
