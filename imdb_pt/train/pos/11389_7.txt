Okay, Kelly is not Astaire, but who he is and Caron is not Hepburn, but Alan Lerner is light years ahead of Comden and Green, who scripted Kelly's other big musical, Singin 'In The Rain (a curious replica of lyricists who write scripts featuring songs from other lyricists and just to balance things, Gershwin's numbers are far superior to Arthur Freed's / Nacio Herb Brown numbers, so Alan Lerner did not have to feel too offended). The story need not stop us more than the anomalies - Kelly has not changed a match and is a painter, that is, bohemian, but he is able to get a perfect suit in a few hours in advance when Foch invites him. to dine at her hotel; in the well-documented sequence of Love Is Here to Stay, lovers are strangely unmolested by passers-by, other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of pedestrian traffic and vehicles - after all, it is a musical feeling stands or falls on the scoreboard and in this case is four squared. As they feel good musicals go definitely is in the top 10.
