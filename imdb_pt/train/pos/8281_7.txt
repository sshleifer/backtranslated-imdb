Since the first scene, I was very excited. "I can tell you this is going to be awesome!" I thought. The performance was so good that I felt like I was on the brink of life for these people. The music was also unusually disturbing. The plot began with a sudden event and then slid forward (one can feel) toward some irrevocable fate. The build was slow, but I personally love that sort of thing, as long as the silent tension stays on the track and is not derailed before it's ready to pay. <br /> <br /> So everything is going well, and then the fireworks begin, and before you know it, the credits are rolling. "WHAT?!!!" was all that my fellow movie night partner and I could say. If you understand the intentions of the director, the blunt ending makes sense (for those who have seen the film, check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com), but I can not help but say that was not very well achieved . <br /> <br /> This could probably have been solved with only ten minutes of material before the climax. Anyway, it's a shame. Those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world. (But for those of you who do not write or make movies, you should know that working out a story arc in a timely manner is a huge pain in the ass, and I'm certainly not making that criticism of any kind of pedestal!) /> <br/> Wendigo seems to me a work of art that was abandoned before ending. But hay, I would take a dull masterpiece any day on a piece of super-ply super-ply dog ​​with many digital effects (like most horror movies currently). <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether I should be scared or laughing. I do not know how to explain this, but there was a distinctly Monty Python feel about this monster in its more egregious "monster" forms. Although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie - I do not know, it still worked for me somehow crooked. I'll never look at deer antlers the same way again! :)
