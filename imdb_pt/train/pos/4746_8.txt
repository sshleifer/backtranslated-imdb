This film seems to draw a limit - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other, those who find it unbearable. <br /> <br /> To begin with, there is a lot of comedy in this movie that many viewers are not "getting". Of course the Li's Mask jet looks like Bruce Lee's Kato - he should, it's a joke. The guy who has a ticking time bomb in his heart - scandalous? Of course, it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask: if this movie is so funny, why all the bloody and excessive violence? well, on the one hand, tolerance to this level of violence is different, from culture to culture; and while the Hong Kong public would recognize that such violence is extreme, it is certainly only a little more than average for an HK action movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, Black Mask is really the kind of film that accepts conventions and genre impulses. to extremes simply because the conventions themselves are totally unrealistic. After decades of seeing people being shot with no open wound, many people were horrified to see Bonnie and Clyde and Wild Bunch outlaws spouting blood everywhere. But the fact is, when you're shot with a quick metal bullet, it's almost certain that blood will flow, especially from an artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese comic book movie. It's true that Spider-Man movies are never so bloody - but if they were true to reality, they would be so! Well, despite its origins in comic books, this film is true to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is filming and editing flamboyant and overly stylized. If the producers of that movie had shot him with a watchful eye on Hollywood nostalgia (such as The Rocketeer, or Sky's recent captain's movie), I doubt anyone has found it offensive. <br /> <br /> But at the moment, I still had a lot of fun watching this movie.
