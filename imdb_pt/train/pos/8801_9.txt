This is the biggest movie I've seen in 2002 while I'm used to mainstream movies. He is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act of these 11 short films. From the technical information (the chosen directors), I feared it had an anti-American base, but ... it's a kind of (11 times) personal tribute. The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: he can not "swallow his pride" and sees this event as a well-deserved punishment ... It's really the weakest part of the film, but this attests to true freedom of expression of the whole play. The strangest comes from the almost conceptual Mexican film ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The other 9 are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me smile, cry or even stun me. I still do not know if S. Imamura's fable is really related or not to the September 11 catastrophe, but it is so beautiful that its final place "does."
