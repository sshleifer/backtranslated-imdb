A linear displacement within a non-linear structure. It is a fact that time, in 12 monkeys, flows in this goes-and-go between present, future and past. However, the linearity of the film can not be avoided: it is the projector's own work, the unfolding of the narrative. <br /> <br /> What we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. . The world of this Terry Gilliam movie is a world with little room for free will. From the outset we are told about the schizophrenic prophecy that a plague would rule the earth in 1997, forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus. <br /> <br /> Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: to go back to the mid-1990s to investigate whatever is and whoever is related to the release of the virus. virus. There is no way to change the past: all that can be done is to gather information that can help the scientists of the present (who, for us, spectators, is the future), to find the cure. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but to make the present better. <br /> <br /> In his "returns" in time, Cole gradually approaches a surprising dilemma: his life in the past is better than his life in the present. <br /> <br /> The latter is bleak and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who elect "volunteers" (that word is incisively ironic) to embark on journeys into the past. <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet reached the highest level of time-travel conquests, and Cole ends up on the wrong dates - this later on in the plot works as evidence of his sanity for psychiatrist Kathryn ( Stowe). <br /> <br /> We can see, through the evolution of history, that linearity and non-linearity intertwine in a circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment when the scene that is first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climax - appears. He modifies himself, according to the evocation of Cole's memories, which arise in his dreams. <br /> <br /> In an airport, a man is shot while running, armed, toward another person. A blonde woman runs after the murdered woman. <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects the past (in which Cole is a child who visits the airport with his parents), the present (the time of the narrative) and the future (adult Cole) narrative, Cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened. The agents who kill him prevent him from killing the mad scientist, the physician Peters (Morse), who is responsible for the spread of the disease. <br /> <br /> What can not be changed. And in Cole's case, that was what it will be. Eternally. <br /> <br /> A film not very well understood by many. For me, nothing less than a masterpiece. Other good films with a similar theme: The Back to the Future trilogy (which has another angle to the character "mad scientist", and although it shares the atmosphere of decadence - particularly in the second film - is much more optimistic than the work of Gilliam, which is a weird picture of Hollywood). In another record, there are "wild strawberries," one of Bergman's masterpieces, this involves a striking and enlightening journey into the past through dreams and reminiscences. <br /> <br /> I've never watched "La Jet√©e", but only because I can not find it.
