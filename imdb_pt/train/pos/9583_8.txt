I waited some time to publish a review of this documentary because, when I first saw it more than 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> I found, from the point of view of the documentary, that this is a good documentary. He did what he set out to do, he showed me something that I had no idea and kept me interested in this world he explored. I knew nothing of the Drag world and found out about them and the "Balls" were simply spectacular to me. These people were as talented at what they do and how they do it for competition. The grumpy staff, the plaintiffs (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the Queen Drag was wearing was not a man's coat!), The jealous ones, it's all there like in any other competition. Like every competition like this. What I felt was a point. <br /> <br /> You had the older drag queen talking about how the balls "used" to be compared to the new drag queens who changed the balls and made more competition categories - and even those who watched knowing future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the track. It was interesting to hear that some of the competitors were living on the street two minutes before the ball, but they came to compete, it was important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories of who "home" and "mother of home" got the best and the brightest in competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now to add after 10 years of watching this movie, I lived the craze called 'Madonna'. I saw some familiar faces from this documentary that ended Madonna during her "Vogue" phase and by right. If it were not for these guys, Madonna would not have the "Vogue" phase, I know that now. The credit should be given where the credit is due. Makes me wonder, if anyone else in America watches this documentary, they will learn that they are not as mainstream as they think.
