I could watch the movie "On Thin Ice" on television in India .. I must say that the film was very well done, and really caused a chill in my spine .. the basic story makes me reflect on what makes certain dependents decide Continue where, while others still remain addicted ... <br /> <br /> However, I felt that Diane Keaton was in her best shape ... the scene where she has desires, and starts rummaging through her house for cocaine ... was the best ... the two boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is .... The script is well done as is the direction and the cinematography ... and the cast /> <br /> A must watch movie ..... for everyone
