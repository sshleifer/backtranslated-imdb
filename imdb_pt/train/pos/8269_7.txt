I was intrigued by this movie for a while, partly because of the extremely high score here on IMDb - an average of 9.0 with over 300 votes gives the highest rating of any accessible silent film! How had I not heard of this movie before this site? Well, you can not always trust ratings. This is really a very good movie, preserved very well if the well-rented VHS transfer is any indication - excellent acting by the directors, especially William Haines as Brown, and good location work in Cambridge with some good action scenes in the Harvard / Yale football game - but the story must have looked like a hoary chestnut tree even in 1926. Indecent, egocentric and charismatic guy goes to school and is put in his place, becoming in the process a caring friend, self-sacrifice; I doubt that people in 1926 have found much of what was really exciting in the last few rolls, the predictability factor is high. Yet it begins very well, and certainly deserves to be remembered, if not praised by the heavens. Maybe the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... EDIT Now, over 600 voters and the score has risen to 9.2! Seriously, folks, there are urns here - I challenge anyone to explain why this is a better movie than "Metropolis" or "The General"!
