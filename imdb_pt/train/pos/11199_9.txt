Sometimes I get tired of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock's lesser-known movies because almost everyone starts out with someone saying that this movie is grossly overlooked or that it's a hidden gem of Hitchcock or a real Hitchcock or some other generic if-only - people - watch - this - they - see - that - is - a - great - Hitchcock - movie - just - how - like - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - So, that said, I I would just like to say that if - just - people - watched - that - they - would - see - that - that - is - a great - Hitchcock - just - like - a lot - like - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psychopath - Back - Window - etc. <br /> <br /> Now this may be a bit exaggerated, The Ring is not of any stretch of the imagination, even in the same league as any of the films mentioned twice above, but compared to the other films that Hitchcock did in the late 1920s and Beginning in the 1930s, I actually think The Ring is one of the best movies photographed and performed of almost all of them. As an almost new director, there are some amazing dream sequences and brilliant editing segments that show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career. <br /> <br /> Granted, the movie begins with, among others. things, the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer (and I use idiot the ultimate way, as Stephen King often does) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd that is not the most elegant of white people. I suppose this just illustrates how incredibly different circuses and people were back then, but I think it's one of the most unpleasant sequences in any Hitchcock movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The main attraction in the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to take down any man in a round but when he finds his game, it is against a man who defies his authority not only in the boxing ring , but also in the ring around the finger of his wife. Then begins a fun challenge, though not very tense, for the love of a woman, who seems to sway from one man to another without effort and without thinking. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) There is, for example, a scene in which the husband watches her from the top while she is left at home late at night and shortly before entering the building she is persuaded back to car for a kiss. This kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that, even at the end, when she is faithful to her husband, or at least finally chooses, they look into each other's eyes, but do not really kiss. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly beautifully photographed, even more so than several films that Hitch has released in the following years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as a One Round Jack trainer who, in his stone face expressionism, often reminds me of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch leaves a bit ambiguous, but this is a great sample of his early work.
