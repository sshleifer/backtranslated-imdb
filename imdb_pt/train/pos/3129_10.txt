This is one of the best meeting specials ever, with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying themselves and having fun doing it. It's amazing how much effort went into detail, particularly recapturing the feel of the 60s era, the Batcave scenario, Wayne Manor, the costumes and the actors selected to play the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero. and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes is well worth your time, and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960s "Batman" television series. I noticed that the "Batman" clips were from the movie, not the series itself, probably because of legal restrictions. Let's hope the three seasons of the show are released on DVD.
