I recently watched it, but when it started I had no idea what the concept was, what the topic was ... in short - I had no idea what it was. It was a documentary, it was a comedy routine ..... Well, it was BOTH. <br /> <br /> It started a little slow, but I guess it's because I had absolutely no idea what kind of program I was seeing. But I quickly sucked. The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing facts and fiction in the story. Especially as we (Americans) learn the story that is not really true - and how we learn what we've done. He did this in a way that kept the viewer completely entertained and interested. I've really learned a few things and this is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see it picked up as a series for HBO. I believe it can be so fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially if they are "taught" in the same way as this episode.
