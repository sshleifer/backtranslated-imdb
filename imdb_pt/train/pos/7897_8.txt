At first glance, this movie does not look like a great movie. After all, Bette Davis' films, with only 166 votes in IMDb and 6.5, must be pretty bad. But the film turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> First, you would expect this to be a typical 1930s typical movie with a stereotypical love story, but the film is surprisingly well built and has an unusual and original storyline that also helps make this very nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story is loaded by its two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. Its helped by a cast of mostly entertaining characters, but the movie mainly involves just around them two. Your character is involved in a love story written, very unusual and intelligent, which also works well. He makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch, which is perfectly fun. <br /> <br /> The film is very short (just over an hour), which means that the story does not waste time unnecessarily. plots, development and characters. This makes the film also very fast, which helps make this movie perfectly suited to today's standards as well. This may make the movie a bit simple at times, but it will never go to the expense of your entertainment or fun. <br /> <br /> A delightful, romantic and enjoyable comedy that deserves to be seen by more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
