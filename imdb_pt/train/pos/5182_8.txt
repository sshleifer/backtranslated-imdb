A quiet, sweet and beautifully nostalgic movie about what it's like to be confronted with old friends and surroundings of your youth with all the memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you. A movie that makes you feel good. All ingredients are here: old jelousy, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Trickery, nighttime refrigerator intrusions, and all the other fun things we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters have the opportunity of a week to experience it again as the former camp leader is now retiring and wants to meet the children of the golden years of the camp. All of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers.
