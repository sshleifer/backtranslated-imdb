Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in theaters. My father took my sister and me, and the funny thing is that when we got home, Dad asked us "what do you want to do now?" and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann and Andy again! lol, and my dad really drove us back to the theater to watch again - at least that's how I remember it. I was five at the time. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty scary for a five year old. The scene with the gigantic ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene ... I do not remember much of this movie, of course, the beginning was magical, and some scenes - I wish I could find it again, and probably look for now. <br /> <br /> I remember that I loved Raggedy Ann and Andy.
