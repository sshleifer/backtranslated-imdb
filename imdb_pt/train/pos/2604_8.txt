"Amazing Grace" has a languorous feel as she tells a contemporary story of several lives in an apartment building. The spoken language is Hebrew, but drama can happen in any modern city. He observes family values, romantic relationships, and age characteristics with equal ease. It does not judge the characters, it only presents them directly, as they strive to solve their individual problems in this modern world. The acting quality is very good, and the observations made on the characters are astute and clear. I really appreciate this fluent movie.
