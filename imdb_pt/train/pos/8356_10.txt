I'm not sure if that counts as a spoiler or not, so beware: Just a small but crucial thing to note, an intriguing possibility: the boys steal a green Citroen at one point, for one joyful ride, and return it to the owner having caused intentional and vengeful hidden damage to the car in the hope that the owner will fall. Is it the same car they steal much later from the picnic family? We know the original owner sold it. They depart at the end on a dangerous road, which I understand was closed to all but pedestrians in the last ten years. A new approach to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On another subject, this movie could have been called "Perfume of a Woman". I do not remember another film, certainly not American, that treats the smell of a woman in such a frank and open way, much like the nose of a good Bordeaux.
