In a penitentiary, four prisoners occupy a cell: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the tramp Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégé, the retarded Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate his six-month-old sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an old newspaper hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of last century and it is about black magic. They decide to read and use their content to escape the prison, when they find the truth about Danvers fate. "Maléfique" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French horror film. The story is practically in the same place, has no cliché and holds the viewer's attention until the last scene. I am a big fan of French cinema, usually novels, dramas and police stories, but I noticed that recently I saw some good French horror films like "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Signs of Evil" ("Signs of Evil")
