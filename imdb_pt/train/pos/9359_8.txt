The feel of this movie was incredible. The performance of Adam Sandler was very inspiring. As he played a very shocked and fragile character, he took his skill to the limit and actually worked the role. His character was very interesting. I can see myself reading the script of this movie and not being as interested in the part as Sandler did to me. For someone who plays basically comedy roles, he played a serious role with what appeared to be his own quirks and comments. I particularly loved the scene where the characters of Adam and Don walked on the motorized scooter across town. I became familiar with the moment because it seemed that Don was witnessing something Adam did to get away from it all. With his video games, music and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, riding a scooter with his headphones seemed like an escape from his thoughts. This movie is definitely worth the watch.
