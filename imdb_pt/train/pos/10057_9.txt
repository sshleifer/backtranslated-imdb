I was going to bed with my boyfriend last night, and while she was brushing her teeth, I turned the channels until I came across this Chinese movie called King of Masks. At first I thought it would be a Kung Fu movie, so I started to watch it, and then immediately it captured me, and I had to finish. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorable. She was a great actress for being so small. Maybe the fact that it was Chinese, so English was nicknamed, made it difficult for me to say ... but she really seemed to be perfectly in character. I felt so bad for the girl as she continued to try to please her "boss", but everything ended up rotting. I laughed a lot. Even when she brings him another grandson, just so he can pass his art ... it turns out that the kid has been kidnapped, so he is arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... whatever she touches in an effort to be cool to her grandfather, ends up backfiring. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches the art of masks ... which is so comforting after all the mishaps of the film. <br /> <br /> Definitely a jewel, and totally unique. <br /> Scott
