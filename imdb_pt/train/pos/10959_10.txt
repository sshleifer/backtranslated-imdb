All I can say is that if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie then you are not human! Even after watching it for the first time, I was hooked. It's a mesmerizing experience that's hard to describe, as I'm sure other fans will attest. After watching, you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have the Gray Gardens to remind them! I think we all long for the fierce independence with which these two ladies were bestowed. Although I've always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she does not stay in her heart the way Big and Little Edie do. What a rare pleasure to meet these people; I just wanted to have it!
