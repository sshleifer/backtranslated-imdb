Great entertainment from start to finish. Wonderful Belushi, Beach, Dalton and Railsback Performances. Some twists and a lot of action scenes. The movie was made for me! Funny lines in script, good music. Dalton as the tough sheriff and Railsback as "villain villain". I must recommend this movie to all fans of action and adventure! 10/10
