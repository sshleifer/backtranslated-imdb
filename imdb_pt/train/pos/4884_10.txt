For people of a certain age, W.W. II was the defining time of their lives, and what followed could never be compared. At the beginning of the film, a recently widowed but still alive woman (Judi Dench) hears a street musician trying to play classical music, "Stardust." <br /> <br /> This recalls her memories of when she played a movie. almost all band of girls that amused itself between bombings during the war. The drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), cheerfully avoided the draft and took advantage of the ladies. <br /> <br /> The character of Patrick and Dench meets and decides to reunite the band, which takes them on a series of mini-adventures. Despite the ups and downs, the band meets and makes a successful comeback. <br /> <br /> The film is exquisitely written and discreet, with superb performances from all involved. The characters are well-developed and all the people who have not stopped living despite their years. And there's all that glorious old swing song! <br /> <br /> This is not the pontificate of Steven Spielberg, but a serious film, however. The war has affected everyone and this lesson is not forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to entertain as it teaches.
