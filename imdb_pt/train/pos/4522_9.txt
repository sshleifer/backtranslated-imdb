This one caught me by surprise because I had often been disappointed with Adrian Pasdar in the past, but he took the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding both farce and pathetic while delivering real moods and emotions. The always wonderful Julie Waters is great here, and anyone who has not yet seen her in Educating Rita, 1983, must rent it right away (wonderful movie). The rest of the supporting characters are also well played, many wonderfully eccentric without going overboard. This is fun.
