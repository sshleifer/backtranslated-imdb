I saw this today with my 8-year-old son. I thought it was cute. I agree with the other poster that was nothing like the book I remember, but we still like it. All the kids are very good and all a lot of fun. Billy is the new kid who accepts the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day. If he loses, he has to walk down the school hallway with worms in his pants. The beginning of the film is set to show that Billy has a very weak stomach and vomits in almost everything. Hilarity follows with a lot of different way of cooking the worms. Good message about tackling bullies and, of course, a happy happy ending.
