Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi star in "Anchors Aweigh," directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two sailors on leave in Hollywood. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and, upon taking him home, find his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls in love with her. She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi. They try to help, but there is a mess. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical with lots of dancing and singing from Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly begins dancing with Jerry the Mouse in a delightful sequence. Grayson sings Jalousie and my heart sings. It is not one of my favorite voices, but it does well. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. Sinatra shows her versatility and why the girls fainted with those big blue eyes and boyish face. For Kelly, this was a great opportunity for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> Wonderful movie, very fluctuating.
