Enjoying the film and the efficient Confucian police drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a daring greedy young man, no doubt representing modern society. I figured the final scene was weird and I could not figure out if we believed the big D was being punished for being greedy or had been part of the plan for a long time. I loved the scene and for the first time in a Chinese movie, the violence was not a choreographed martial arts party. One thing that always amuses me about HK movies is that the main influence the British seem to have is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'excuse' into the local language and it's fun that long after we're gone, they're still over there.
