First of all I would like to say is that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee is way better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original films I've seen so far; shows a Cambodian poverty lifestyle background. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) goes out killing people to survive; He did this all his life. Sam Lee's (Wai's) duty is to capture the Cambodian forever. There are tons of violent action, but it has a good story for that. The film shows the struggles between these two characters; both beat each other like angry dogs. GO AND WATCH PPL ... STRONG SUGGESSTED !!! (GO HK FILMS)
