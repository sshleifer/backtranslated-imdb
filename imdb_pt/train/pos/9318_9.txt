Red Skelton was still another major star that made the transition from films to television with ease. <br /> <br /> His shows certainly brought laughter to American homes years ago. <br /> <br /> He starts the show with an opening monologue. Then we would have a variety of characters. Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue? How can we forget San Fernando Red? I remember an episode in which, as king, Red introduced his queen referring to her as his fat. <br /> <br /> Go know that Red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life. He lost a child to leukemia at age 11. His wife, Georgia, died of suicide.
