I was disappointed, if not surprised, by the lack of appreciation this movie received. Once again, Billy Zane proves that he is more than just a handsome Hollywood kid in a silent performance that combines jerky antics with pompous behavior. Calling this silent movie is inaccurate, as there is a lot of music and sound. He has a manic rhythm and is full of the goofy inventiveness that Ed Wood is finally beginning to be appreciated by. Look at the cast list and notice that they all shine. No one is there just to show your face. I believe they are all in the movie to show their appreciation for Wood, and to make a broad physical type of acting not seen much these days. <br /> <br /> But today the reviewers try to guess what's going on. become a lot more successful than showing any kind of aesthetic appreciation for a movie. And IWUETDID has no discernible audience. It was mostly done out of love for Wood's script. Even after his death, the social parasites of fashion gave him another hard blow and deprived the world of a minor classic. This is a highly entertaining and genuinely experimental movie that really deserves to live, at least on DVD.
