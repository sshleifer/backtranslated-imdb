I'm a kung fu fan, but I'm not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangsters full of over-the-top gun-play. Now, martial arts; *This is beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here, producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie that almost has * a lot of fighting *, if such a thing is possible! That's nice. <br /> <br /> Many of the fighting scenes are very good (and some are less good), and the main characters are fun and enjoyable. The bad guys are a bit incredibly bad, but fun, though. You have to see the Sorcerer Asleep !! He can only fight when he is asleep - he is hysterical! In repeated views, however, Last Hurray For Chivalry can tend to get a bit boring and wordy, also especially since many of the fighting scenes are actually not so good. So I rate it as "just" a 7 out of 10. But it's actually almost an "8". <br /> <br /> In all, one of the best kung fu movies, made in the heart of prime kung fu cinema. All really good kung fu movies are half-finished in the late 70's, with some notable exceptions from the late 60's and early 70's (and early 80's, to be fair).
