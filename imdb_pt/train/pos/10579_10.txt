The energetic young theatrical prologues (staged performances, often musical, who have often pursued the film in larger theaters in past ages) must deal with dishonest competition, fraudulent partners, infidel lovers and amateur talent to fulfill their dream of making their mark . in the FOOTLIGHT parade. <br /> <br /> Although similar to other Warner musicals, notably the GOLDDIGGER films, this movie had a special attraction that none of the others had: Jimmy Cagney. He is a wonder, flexible and agile, as nimble as any cat - a creature he mimics a few times during the film. Cagney catches the attention of the audience and never lets go, fueling the quick and tacky dialogue with his charisma and floating charm. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast gives their best, too. Joan Blondell is perfect as the wide-eyed blonde secretary and big heart, in love with Cagney (why did not she give him a musical number?). Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler once again play lovers on stage and out; the fact that his singing and acting skills are a bit on the thin side are offset by his dancing; Powell still exudes youthful enthusiasm in his position as unaccustomed as the second male protagonist. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee & Hugh Herbert are a lot of fun as brothers-in-law, both of whom are planning to fool Cagney in different ways. Ruth Donnelly is the wealthy wife of Kibbee, a woman dedicated to her beautiful proteges. Frank McHugh's experienced choreographer is a good candidate for Cagney's wit. Herman Bing is hilarious in his little scene as a musical arranger. Mavens will meet little Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin and maybe even John Garfield during the musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's Busby Berkeley, nonpareil choreographer. His Terpsichorean confections, scattered throughout the 1930s, were a supreme example of the cinematic escapism that the Depression public wanted to enjoy. The big joke about Berkeley's creations, of course, was that they were part of the plot as a part of theatrical productions. But no theater could hold these products of the master's imagination. They are perfect illustrations of the kind of entertainment that is only possible thanks to the movie camera. <br /> <br /> Berkeley's musical offerings generally take one of two different approaches, or a (often quite bizarre) story told of music and dance; or impressively geometrically projected numbers, eyeshadows, many chorus girls, a camera job on high, and a romantic melody. In a spasm of extravagance, FOOTLIGHT PARADE peaks with three Berkeley masterpieces: "Honeymoon Hotel" and its pre-production code counting the wedding night of a couple; `By A Waterfall '- dozens of uncoated females, splashing, floating and diving into perfect patterns and designs (watching closely and you'll see how the synchronous effects were achieved); and finally, `Shanghai Lil '- an appropriate tribute to the talents of Cagney and Berkeley.
