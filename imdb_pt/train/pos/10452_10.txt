I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they were meant for each other, that in many moments of the movie we want them to die for each other. Your story is what we always want and probably most of us have never attained. This is about love, but not stupid things like "notting hills" or that kind of movie. This is life and I believed in them, I believed they were falling ... This was so smart and touching. I just finished to see a minute ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible again. <br /> <br /> I have to say that now I was becoming misanthrope and felt like love was just a fake, a concept, but with this movie I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when , something really could happen. <br /> <br /> I am French and did not know too well Delpy Julie though Kieslowski "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see the other of her works because she looks like an angel and has an acting perfect. <br /> <br /> I saw "before sunset" (the sequence in Paris) a few days before I see "before sunrise" and it does not matter. They are two masterpieces. proof that you do not need to impress your eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English that I'm trying to do better. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
