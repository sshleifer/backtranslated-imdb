Great movie. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My small problem was that the trains of the film belonged to the Hungarian state railways (M√ÅV), and of course they were used on large trains, not the local railroad - according to the story that Chikatilo took on his victims. stations. Also, the movie is great.
