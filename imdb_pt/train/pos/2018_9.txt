I loved it so much I bought the DVD and the novel at the same time. The chemistry between the actors (including little Arthur) is incredible and exciting. <br /> <br /> Could have used a little more time on the screen for the yummy Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And Gilbert Markham has been incredibly "into it" since the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The one who thrilled me most with amazing shock and admiration and admiration was Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I adore him in Forsyte Saga and everything else I saw him in. But he overcomes himself here like Arthur. In my wildest dreams, I could not imagine him playing an insane psycho like Arthur Huntingdon. But it does. And I love it. And I love him.
