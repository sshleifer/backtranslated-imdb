James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author. When one reads "Liberation," one is immediately transported to the lush interior of the deep south. When you watch John Boorman's film version of the book, one notices how accurately it captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narration. The characters are fully realized and the portraits are fantastic. I saw this movie for the first time in 1992, after my first year of college. I was at a stage where I watched movies that were released within a few years of my birth in 1973. Among them were Patton, Papillon and All the Men of the President; thin films, all of them. This was easily the class of the group. That says a lot.
