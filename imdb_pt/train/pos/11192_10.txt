I've shown this movie several times here in college, and every time I show it, the number of people watching with me grows exponentially ... beyond the virgins, anyone I've ever shown the NEEDS to see it again! It takes a while to get in, but at the end the whole room is screaming, screaming, screaming, rewinding scenes repeatedly, repeating the dialogue, and totally and completely engrossed in Pia Zadora's movie experience in "The Lonely Lady." "Scene after scene after scene of the most poorly filmed, poorly written, horribly played TRASH scene is thrown at you in a total attack which ranks as the most country thing I own (no small assertion, friends). 2 U, Pia ... and I do not think I'm the only one who has ever felt this way!
