I went to see Ashura as the launch of the 2005 Fantasy Festival. Man, that was a nice kick. The director should be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere, but for health reasons, he's still in Japan ... oh lord, I hope he gets better and does a lot of other films. The plot is quite simple but somewhat original ... the demons are wandering in Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called "Demon Wardens" are killing them and fearing the rebirth of Ashura, the demonic goddess who is sleeping and is supposed to be very smart. <br /> That brings us to Izumo ... some kind of elite swordsman named "Demon Slayer" and his friend Jaku, who is the typical jealous and violent idiot ... <br /> <br /> It seems boring? Well, now, thick .... Izumo has retired from killing demons since he killed a young boy in the "impression" that he was the devil, he never knew, but he killed her. Then Izumo continued with his life and recycled himself in the Kabuki theater. On a boat trip on a nice night, Izumo sees a girl hiding on a bridge and that changes her life and resumes to kill demons ... for good cause, the cause of love ... and damn ... the guy knows how to deal with a sword and pull a fun slaughter. Izumo takes the movie as far as the game goes ... he's the total package ... he knows how to fight (yes he knows), he's witty, he's smart and he's got the guts. You never have to shout, "IN IZUMO, IT'S A TRAP" The guy already knows he has such good sense. He's really the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> As far as cinematography is concerned, aesthetics are very interesting. It is by far the movie that looks more like a manga. It's full of special effects and nothing at all costs will prevent this movie from looking realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Many colors and an "unreal" photograph, moreover ... is quite simple ... but as I said, the main character is carrying the film A must see, a tale led by masterful hands.
