I chose to watch this movie in Tribeca based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and thought it was one of the best films of the festival. The two main actors present a sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level. The director did a great job, bringing the characters and the story to life with skill that is not normally seen in a production for the first time. <br /> <br /> An interesting aspect of this film is the love of wood and the city of New York. (Brooklyn in particular). Does the film revolve around family furniture doing business and weaves delicate cinematography from the carpentry and everyday life in Brooklyn? once again congratulations to the director for this excellent choice. <br /> <br /> This is a gem and I would wholeheartedly recommend it (I'm sure it will hit the screen).
