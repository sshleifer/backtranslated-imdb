The busy Phillips did an incredible performance, both comical and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good, but Busy stole the show. It was a nice touch after The Smokers, a movie starring Busy, which was not so good. If Busy did not get a nomination of any kind for this movie, it would be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, check out the Home Room.
