I agree with the above comment, I love realism in this, and in many movies (not just movies about eating disorders) the producers seem to forget this. They take a problem every day and create an extremely dramatic scene and then comes the end of the movie everything is perfect again, which I do not like because it is not reality. It does not mean that things can not improve, and do not mean things that do not do in this movie, but does not spend most of the film creating all these problems, and at the end of the movie everything is perfect again. When people have eating disorders, people not only admit it and want to get better, and then life is tasty, it takes time, and I like how in this movie we grew up with the characters, we went through the difficulties with them, getting better and worse, because it's a very important part of the movie. It enters the minds of people with eating disorders and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way, and I loved it. I also love how it shows the secret and betrayal that people feel when they suffer from eating disorders, it's scary to see how people react when they find out, especially if they approve of it. I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told, and defiantly one of my favorites.
