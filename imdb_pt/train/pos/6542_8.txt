While well past the target audience, I always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so I was naturally intrigued by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in simple and simplistic terms, with traces of risk to the young detective. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about the story was that the final results were quite serious and significant and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and we hope to see her again in another mystery.
