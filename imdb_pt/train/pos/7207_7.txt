I entered Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while this is something like what this movie is; I can not help but think he's just a detective of a poor man. The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of plot, but certainly is the case of execution. The cast of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms this. The film is based on a piece by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his last moves, Sidney is in low; and this is not helped when a piece called Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, comes to his door. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins to build a plot of his own; which involves inviting around the amateur scribe, killing him, and then passing Deathtrap out as his own work. <br /> <br /> In spite of all his intelligent twists and turns; Deathtrap falls into a primary element, and those are the characters. The movie fails to provide a single friendly character, and it's very hard to care about the story when you're not rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by acting. Michael Caine does a good and fun performance as you would expect, but no one is proud. Christopher Reeve is clumsy in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to render obnoxious the only possibly amiable character with downright annoying performance. Fortunately, the story is good; and it's good enough to save the movie. The plot has many twists; some work better than others, but there is always enough to ensure the film remains interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit as well, since the style of the film is another great advantage. The central location is interesting in itself, and cinematography fits well into the movie. Overall, I have to admit I liked this movie; but it could have been much, much better.
