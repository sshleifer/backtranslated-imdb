Intelligent, ironic and thrilling, "The Invisible Man" stood out in 2000 between the usual Sci-Fi programming, balancing the fantastic art direction of "Farscape" and sometimes melodramatic script with cynical and rude plottings and modern noir dialogues. The show ranged between "Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" on the credibility meter, but there was no denying the fact that the "I-Man" characters went beyond the caricature. Even predictable characters, such as the Guardian, the Officer, and Eberts, were given the liberties of formulating. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and changed elegantly, most notably by the team of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overload the plot, and science only sometimes bordered on the totally unbelievable. The highlights of the show are still fun, and I've never seen those tense pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi are to be commended, and fans have the right to demand a full DVD edition of the program. Every time I come across a marathon of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" on Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sigh, mourning the excitement and possibility of the science fiction television that "Invisible Man" and his laia represented.
