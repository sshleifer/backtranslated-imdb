I'll keep this review short and sweet .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer for this and thought about taking a spin in 5 minutes and my initial thoughts were "what the heck is this?" But after 10 minutes I was hooked and after 20 I was catching my chin off the floor. This film is a great example of how a film can be different and, in addition, it is French. This film is an art-eyed sweet wrapped in a neat futuristic film noir package, the motion capture is very clever and the animation style black and white that has no gray though at first did not do this for me totally captivated me and by the end of the movie and I found myself wishing every movie was made so. I think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing, it would have been very easy to ruin if they had not gotten so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters (Just watch any Hong Kong legends movie in English to see an example perfect) I gave it 9 though I gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels ....
