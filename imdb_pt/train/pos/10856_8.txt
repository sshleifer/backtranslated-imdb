British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: silent study, introspective, usually romantic and farce social satire. Configurations, characters, and concepts vary, but certain characteristics put the vast majority of programs into one of two categories. Butterflies is perhaps the epitome of the first type. <br /> <br /> The scripts are very verbal, including long monologues inside the main character Ria, a basically happy but uneasy housewife, curious about what she might have missed when embarking on a completely conventional life. When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible entrepreneur (who clearly demonstrates her interest in her), she jokes about the idea of ​​finding out what the other path might have offered. <br /> <br /> The acting and scripts are always in the money, which makes the person's reaction to the show almost entirely personal: I was not impressed or turned off. My mother, on the other hand, loved this show. I think the degree to which it identifies with Ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining a reaction to butterflies.
