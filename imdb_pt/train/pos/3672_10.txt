A fake documentary about a couple of Canadian producers, Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), trying to make their first movie in the late '70s. Hollywood North is the comic book of their struggle to pull it all together, despite a number of conflicting topics. <br /> <br /> Hollywood North works as a movie in much the same way as This Is Spinal Tap (1984) works. so good. That is, although it is exaggerated in some respects, it is very close to the truth, and the truth consists of "behind the scenes" facts that are very different from the public face of the industry. It's not easy to make a movie, and it must have been especially difficult in Canada in the late 1970s. Movies involve dozens, if not hundreds, of people. Many have desires, motivations, and incompatible personalities. Especially crucial are the financiers and the talent on the screen, as if it fell or became unreliable at any stage while the film was in production, could compromise the whole affair, whether it required extensive rephrasing or abandoning the film altogether. So it's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on these kinds of relationships. The result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic. The script is flawless and the performances are top notch. This is a must for any beginner filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of making movies. It should also be more than fun for any viewer with a minimum of intelligence and sense of humor. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10 of me.
