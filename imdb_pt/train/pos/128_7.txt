Von Trier once explained how he created such a strong involvement of the viewer with his films, putting his film world in the midst of the real world and the imagined world. Then, as viewers, we think we see a "true" story, while in fact we are completely manipulated, often to the point that the film is disturbing (The Idiots / Idioterne). Of course the Dogme films acted only as a vehicle for this theory (as well as creating some welcome spotlight on Von Trier). The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, seems to balance relationships with everyone else, but soon becomes a victim of the problems others have created in the past for themselves. The idealist inevitably has to reject society to remain idealistic and become the terrorist. Humanity is ruined and purity only leads to (self) destruction. (These elements were also very ubiquitous in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The film is also full of cynical (even humorous) nuances about the role of Germans and Americans in postwar Germany. As a technical achievement, the film is beautifully designed: dislocation and fading of faded colors, screen overlays, action on different overlays (with the filming of the future mayor as the most interesting). In this film, we can see how the Von Trier bands are good as a technical medium. In his later works, he seems to move away from this (as if he was no longer interested in technical achievements because they become so readily available).
