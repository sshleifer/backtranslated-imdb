The plot: A crime lord is joining 3 different mafias in a company to buy an island, which would serve as a money laundering facility for organized crime. To foil this, the FBI tries to arrest one of the Mafia lords. The thing goes awry, and for some improbable twists and turns, we're presented with another movie of "police friends who do not like each other" ... being an FBI agent and the other a former DEA agent <br /> < So far, so stupid. But the strength of this film is not in its story - a joke in bad taste, at best. It is funny. (At least the German version is synchronized). The action is good too, with a memorable scene involving a gun and a rocket launcher. But the focus is directly on humor. Not clever satire, it's not much clownery, but somewhere in the middle, you have a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is the opposite of the politically correct. Legal drug abuse is highlighted, uncritical, and even displayed as legal. This is the part of the movie that seriously annoyed me and makes it unsuitable for kids, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, for a nice evening watching the action acceptable with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: In this genre, it's common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the movie theater / TV. So you're going to have a good time. 8/10
