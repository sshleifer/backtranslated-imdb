It's incredible! In Story Mode, you go from punk to pro. You need to complete goals that involve skating, driving, and walking. You create your own skateboarder and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he betrays you and you are kicked out of the skateboard team (you can choose a team to be) and then you start your own team! There are many levels, such as New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (not part of story mode) of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skateboarders like Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals such as SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and more. You can create the goal pedestrian and write what he talks about. If you get bored doing this, you can make the premade goals in prefabricated parks. The only thing I did not like in this game was that sometimes it was difficult to drive the cars. 9/10
