James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers at a Budapest gift shop who do not like each other very much, not knowing they are really friends of the type they do not yet know. <br /> <br /> A very charming romantic comedy, very involved by its two stars and a supportive cast very eager to please. The story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence (I'm not sure how to explain it) that the movies of today just do not have. This can obviously be compared to the recent "You've Got Mail", and the original wins in every way. <br /> <br /> This is a must see every Christmas, I can not think of a better way to leverage a Christmas feel than this little gem.
