What a good movie! Finally, a photo revealing an unknown side of rock: illusions of fame. Well-known rockers are getting old and forgotten, not the music. And with a good sense of humor. Have you ever danced in Bill Haley's Rock Around the Clock? <br /> <br /> Anyway, Still Crazy is probably the best rock n 'roll movie I've ever seen. Much better than the Spinal Tap, for example. Because? Because in Still Crazy, people are mature. They have a different point of view about rock, about love and about life. They want to catch up with the crazy youth they so much miss. In addition to the story itself, we see characters with their own personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like any of us. <br /> <br /> Spend a good time watching (listen to the incredible soundtrack!) and finally thinking about your own future. <br /> <br /> Bye!
