This has some excellent points, but the length of the film can not sustain the thin web of the wafer. They are other cinematic slackers, faster than Astaire's "Follow the Fleet," but not as good as "On The Town." <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is bland, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their number "If you knew Susie" is hilarious when they make up the song as they sing it. 'I Begged Her' is also fun with Sinatra showing how skillful he was in walking. Sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be set to show their singing, not as part of the story. Fortunately, there are supporting actors like Grady Sutton, Ragland Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an improbable, but undisturbed, Jose Iturbi like him, to keep watching. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the star of the movie, although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children, which Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the Navy and clings to the character Kelly. He also visits a school, resulting in him telling the kids a fictional story of his life in the Pomeranian Navy (!), Which takes his wonderful dancing with a lively Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he dances a charming Mexican Dance Hat with a sublimely dark little girl, Sharon McManus, who is fascinating and sweet. Very nice then, but a little too long. A taster of the best musicals to come.
