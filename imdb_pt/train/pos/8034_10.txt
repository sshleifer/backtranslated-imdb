There are few movies that seem to provide entertainment and realism. If you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern warfare, take a look at this. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene where hundreds of soldiers fire in the jungle, no one knows for sure where this shot came from? <br /> <br /> And they cut a scene to save Private Ryan, so there's got to be some merit in the scene. <br /> <br />
