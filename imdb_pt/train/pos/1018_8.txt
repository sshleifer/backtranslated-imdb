The film was sub-par, but this Television Pilot offers a great stepping stone to what has become an ideal science fiction fan show. The actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having a clever and interesting script does not hurt either. <br /> <br /> The Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite shows.
