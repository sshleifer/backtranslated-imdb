A sentimental story with a sentimental soundtrack. It's about a little girl (with a voice impediment) who values ​​her green parrot Paulie. The parrot thinks and speaks as a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> The parrot is definitely the star of the movie. Sometimes mischievous and sometimes in bouts of depression, the bird captures the mood in a remarkable and expressive way. The synchronized voice is also very well made and within a minute or two you can really believe that this clever birdie exists. At the beginning of the film, his father gives the bird to a pawnshop and the subsequent scenes tell the story of Paulie's constant struggle over many years to reunite with his lover. One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people who use the teller machines. Paulie seems to have a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The ending is predictable, but who would want it otherwise. Kids will love this movie and anyone who retains a bird as a pet will indulge in Paulie's antics.
