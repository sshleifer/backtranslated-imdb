This movie is great! He touched my cold stone heart. I could not relate to the racial discrimination that Antwone experienced because I am living in my own country. I think it's really difficult to be discriminated against. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie in our sociology class at New Era University, and I did not know it was a true story, I thought it had just been created by an intellectual who wants to bring fresh air into the industry. It's very good. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me was when Nadine abused Antwone (who was only six) sexually. If I were in your shoes, I might have jumped a ten-story building. I greet you for being so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me here is when Antwone finally saw his mother Eva face to face. He did not bother her or whatever, instead he told her about the accomplishments he had gained in the long years they had been separated. (I think I'll do it when I get the chance to trace my roots.)
