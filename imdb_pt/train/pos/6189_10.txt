Who would have guessed - Hal Hartley creates a cinematic corollary for Syriana, maintaining his idiosyncratic style. The merger is a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Having not seen a Hal Hartley movie for about a decade, I approached it with some caution. Its brilliant productions of the 90s impressed the critics and the public with its unique style and dialogue. The director's previous films featured colorful characters and offered close-up remarks - often in the Long Island region, New York City or New York City itself - that were unusual and insightful. <br /> <br /> My initial warning resulted from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller." To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to encompass his well-established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than you think. Hartley's film maintains the focus of dialogue and character that are its trademarks along with a unique cinematic style. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly it is coming to its own. The cast does a great job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey fans will see it in full bloom here, still with us and more mature and beautiful than before.
