The success of John Van Druten Broadway is brought to the screen with maximum star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern witch who enchants a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart may have the highest billing but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most attractive witches of all time to cast a spell on the screen. Lead pairing is, in fact, one of the film's few weaknesses: the gray-haired Stewart looks a little old for the role, and while it's easy to understand why he falls in love with Novak, it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him, as they seem incompatible in temperament and perspective. (It's one of the fun concepts in the story that witches and wizards are portrayed as beatniks and bohemians from Greenwich Village.) Curiously, Stewart-Novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in "Vertigo," released the same year as this movie, Vertigo "had a compelling thriller and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. The comedic moments of the film are largely provided by the supporting cast, including young Jack Lemmon (as Kim's wizard brother), Elsa Lanchester (his ditzy aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (! ) As a confused writer. Hermione Gingold even appears in a hilarious turnout as a sort of Great Witch. There's a lot to like in this movie - wit, romance and a great cast - that is, if you can take your eyes off the lovely Miss Novak. I've seen the movie half a dozen times, and I never can.
