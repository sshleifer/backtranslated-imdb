I did not know the actual events when I sat down to watch this, just the fact that this was based on a true story. After the death of the boy's father, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree (... I did not know anyone actually named her descendants) to deal with the loss. This is actually done for kids, as is often the case with "family" movies (with that said, go ahead and gather everyone for a show, although I keep the teens out of it unless you're sure they are going to buy the concept), but do not underestimate the pain that a father's death is, and he does not really talk to anyone. The plot is interesting enough and moves well enough. Acting varies, with the excellent Burstyn surpassing most of his cast, Mathis following this very well, and Ferland and his colleagues (with a few exceptions) being the least convincing of the group (and frankly, they are annoying; I'm actually in the intended audience for this thing). Editing and cinematography are standard, and certainly not less than that. While humor is limited to a handful of fun lines, the tone is not unpleasant. There's an intense scene or two in that. I recommend this to fans of these types of movies. 7/10
