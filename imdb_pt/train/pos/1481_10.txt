I now that today, some people do not see a film without the style of the film, both Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, have changed what we expect in a movie, perhaps, Casomai is no longer an Independent-not-American film, the film take all the film and language features to tell us a simple story about love and marriage but much more .. Totally exhibits, lectures and let you think ... and I'm sure you can not fell boried any second of a long 116 minutes. I guess it does not have a scene that is longer than 3 or 2 minutes.
