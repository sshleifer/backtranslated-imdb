Greetings again from the darkness. Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist. How strange it is for most of us to see someone who MUST work ... no matter the conditions, otherwise their reason for living ceases. Watching Goldsworthy's sculptures come alive and see their reaction to each of them is extremely voyeuristic. This artist creates because he should - not for money or fame. It is your life force. When you see your failures, the energy seems to expel from your body like a hot air balloon bursting. It is not the fear of starting over, it is that it draws your energy from your work. Watching him create just to have control of nature and remember his work is somewhat painful, but nonetheless, breathtaking. He discusses flow and time in minimal dialogue and there seems to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same. When he says he needs the land, but he does not need it ... I disagree. Only complaint is the musical score seems to further decrease a pace which is relaxing at best.
