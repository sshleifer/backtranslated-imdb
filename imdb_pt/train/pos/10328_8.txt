Manufacturers chose the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully. Each interior is full of details that tells everything about the people who live in it. If the period is the 20s (the first story), the present (ie, 1950) for the middle story, or the 1910's (the latter), the costumes and scenarios are carefully observed and created. I love the two ladies' hectic dresses at the sanatorium-exquisite lace covered by Shetland's finest shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but no matter the young lovers, it is Raymond Huntley as the man who resents the health and independence of his wife who torments our emotions. He used to play comic and pompous types, but here he is subtle, convincing and very impressive. China Seas (great movie of the 30s starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot of the episode of Mr. Know All (and also told a story of Kipling). I would like to see more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband - although he has a good looking melancholy moment in a Mexican hat. I love that elegant bird who plays his wife too.
