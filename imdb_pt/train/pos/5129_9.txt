I can see why this movie was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short, as it was mastered. Even if you do not particularly like Blues (although for me, that sounds much more like jazz), you can easily enjoy this movie. It's simply done very well, though for my life I can not understand why director Gjon Mili could only direct a film - this one. In other words, the film is indicated and yet the director did not get any kind of career boost. As for black artists, I could understand this by not making their careers change at high speed, as unfortunately most white society has indifference (or worse) to blacks or "that kind of music." <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, if you do not like the previous part, skip to the 5:50 mark - where it increases considerably. When the girl stopped singing and the artists began to improvise, the pace improved a lot.
