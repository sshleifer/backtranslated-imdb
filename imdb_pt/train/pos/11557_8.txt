Often laugh loudly, sometimes sad story of 2 divorced working men - Lemmon a neat "neurotic husband" housekeeper and Matthau a sloppy sports journalist - they decide to live together to reduce expenses. <br /> <br /> Very well photographed and directed. The script is very barbed - that is, there is always more than one side in almost every line. Particularly funny scene involves 2 British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem amused by everything anyone says, but when Lemmon takes his pictures of children and, yes, ex-wife-to-be, he has the girls crying along with he before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Great fun.
