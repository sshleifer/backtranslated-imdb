I love Satan's well !!! David Tennant is a great actor and Billie Piper too! Who else loves Will Thorp in pieces ??? He's so cute, is not he? I hated the parts where he was possessed by the devil and where he was sent to "go to hell," as Rose put it bluntly. Remember, he was very funny when he said, "Rose, do us a favor, will you? Shut the hell up!" Mr. Jefferson was so brave, was not he? Dying to save others. I felt very sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he came out of possession the second time because he was so scared. I was like, "Oh my God, if I were Rose, I'd be so scared for him." And when she hugged him I was like "grrrrrr, he's mine!" but I found it very sweet. And the doctor ... well, I thought he was going to tell Ida "tell Rose I love you," but he did not say. Oh well.
