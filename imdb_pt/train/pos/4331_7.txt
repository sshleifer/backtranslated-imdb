Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of Poirot's best books, for it is very scary and has an ingenious ending. There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually stunning with some lovely photographs and a very astonishing soundtrack. As always, David Suchet is flawless as Hercule Poirot, the comic highlight of the episode is the battle of Poirot against a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive Captain Hastings. The rest of the cast turns into decent performances, but be careful not to overshadow the two tracks, a danger in some Christie adaptations. Some of the episodes were pretty scary, a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode that I liked a lot more than this. What made it scary in particular, putting aside the song was when Louise Leidner sees the ghostly face through the window. About the adaptation, it was quite faithful to the book, but I will say there were three things I did not like. The main problem was the pace, it is quite slow, and there are some scenes in which very little happens. I also did not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a killer. In the book, I see him as a very nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a killer, and underdeveloping it, made him a less attractive character, although I'm glad they did not lose their drug addiction. . (I also noticed that the writers have left out the fact that Mrs. Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the next victim of the killer.) The other thing that was not so impressive was that I felt I could If the adaptation had been effective from the point of view of Amy Leatheran, as in the book, Amy seemed less sensitive in the adaptation. All in all, despite some errors of judgment in favor of the authors, I enjoyed the murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
