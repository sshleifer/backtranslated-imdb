This is a great movie for any fan of Hong Kong action movies. In addition to the plot, the weak drama and the comedy antics, the film is filled with actions of armed struggle and martial arts. It kept me entertained from start to finish. I thought Shannon Lee was amazing in the movie. Having an action director like Corey Yuen is what keeps Hong Kong's action strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
