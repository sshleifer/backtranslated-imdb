A very strong film. Bruce is good and so is Brad. <br /> <br /> As I think there are two cities lost on the list receptionist list Bruce remembered. <br /> <br /> That means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job. <br /> <br /> Well, the Novikov property seems to me working on this movie. However, I believe in Back to the future theory of the multiplicity of worlds. <br /> <br /> So Bruce could save the world, but not his world. <br /> <br /> In the theory of parallel worlds man can meet. <br /> <br /> And I believe that there is no problem in this. Here I disagree with Dr. Brown from Back ... <br /> <br /> But the story of 12 Monkeys has its own beauty. Despite all these theories of a world or many or a continuum, one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor - his girlfriend just got lost. <br /> <br /> A sequence of events that may lead you to believe that it is from the future. The bullet - well, it could be some mistake, some fake. <br /> <br /> Well, I like this movie - I have to buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> Better.
