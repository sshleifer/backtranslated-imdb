I was quite surprised by this movie. Even if your budjet was obviously missing, you have to be impressed by the fact that this movie took 7 years to produce and still looks good. The acting was quite impressive and the story really captivated me. My only complaint would be that the end really was a bit abrupt for my liking. But, hey, if your audience keeps wanting more, then this movie was successful. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend to anyone in Hollywood to look for Antonella Rios, who is an excellent Spanish talent (something hard to find today with every day) the bad soap opera. Antonella RÃ­os is truly a rising star.
