Any true wrestling fan would have to consider this Wrestlemania as one of the best if not the best of all time. It was full of excitement and surprises. One of the greatest games of all time was between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin with special guest Mike Tyson. The show that Michaels put on was unbelievable, especially considering the way he was on his back and that this was his last match.
