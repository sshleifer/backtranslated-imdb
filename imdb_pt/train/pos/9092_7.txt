I think this film increases diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way it shows the various communities that go out together in Thailand is very interesting ... The Portuguese, the Japanese and the various communities are run by the king. The plots around the court are like a power struggle with a lot of treachery. The wardrobe is fine. The film is also made locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene with the elephants as performers is very interesting. It's fun and I think it's also usable in schools for its historical accuracy because it shows that Europeans in Asia were subjects of local kings in a very different way from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
