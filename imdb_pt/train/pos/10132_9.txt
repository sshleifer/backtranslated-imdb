In this first episode of Friends, we are introduced to the 6 main characters in the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and eventually Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We found out that Rachel, a rich girl who's been friends with Monica since high school, left her fianc√©, Barry, at the altar, since she discovered that she did not love him. She also decides to live with Monica and become independent of her father, getting a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other hand, discovered that his wife is a lesbian and lost it to Susan, his partner. (We see him moving into a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> Monica, in this episode, does (and eventually sleeps) with Paul "the wine face", who gave him the excuse of being impotent since that he divorced his wife. But in truth, he was only fooling her. <br /> <br /> Ps: I just love Joey and Chandler in the first season! =)
