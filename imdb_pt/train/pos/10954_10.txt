Sarah Silverman is like a totally maniacal Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm already in love. Yes, if you loved Jesus it is Magic, you will love it. If you did not, what the hell is wrong with you? Lots of compliments to the comedy channel for having pushed this to my face. My life finally makes sense, and "Your car smells like farts" is my kind of mood. I'm a happy face. The first episode made me laugh hysterically and I'm looking forward to next week. It's as if the grease joins South Park. Completely scandalous. Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book. Your delivery is accurate and so funny. She never jumps a beat. Come to think of it, it is not so much your choice of material. which is a very good thing, by the way, as is the way she chooses to deliver it. Thank you Sarah Silverman! Thanks, comedy channel!
