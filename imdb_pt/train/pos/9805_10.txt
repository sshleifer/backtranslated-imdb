Fans of 'Capital City' rejoice! This first season of this series is now available on Network DVD and I recently received my copy! Although a lot of key maverick characters from the 'CAPITAL CITY' keyboard present us with several moments through their first and second season when each team member plays a significant role on a particular centerline or peripheral. The cultural mix (English, Irish, American, German, Polish) of Head Trader's professional group Wendy Foley (played by Joanna Phillips-Lane) is balanced with her own mannerisms, interests and personalities that help make her unfamiliar and , for most people, apparently sterile subject of financial negotiation reasonably involved by the engaging performances of the cast. In fact, this seemingly dynamic young staff is in direct contrast to the rather serious and old-fashioned senior administration of Shane Longman, represented by Lee Wolf (Richard Le Parmentier) and James Farrell (Denys Hawthorne). I suspect that such an unconventional way of working as an employee of Wendy's team would not have come true had it not been for the reclusive and juvenile 'free spirit' Peter Longman inheriting his father for thirty percent of the company and allowing for a more modern trend. The modern and relaxed way of becoming a reality. To some extent, Wendy's immediate supervisor, Leonard Ansen (John Bowe), follows the establishment of the traditional way of running the company, although his fondness for Wendy prefers to see him occupy the "middle ground" on most occasions. The main interest in the series, I believe, stems from the romantic attraction between Declan by Douglas Hodge and Michelle Hauptmann (played by Trevyn McDowell), who had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond of the intimate friendship / affection they undoubtedly had. <br /> <br /> Eager to navigate this title, and hopefully the second season of thirteen is not too far away!
