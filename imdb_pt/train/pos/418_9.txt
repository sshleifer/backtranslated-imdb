This is a roaring western rip and I watched it many times and has fun on all levels. However, if its after the true facts about such legends as Hickcock, Cody and Jane Calamity, then look elsewhere like John Ford suggested this is the West when the story moves with a crack rhythm, and there is a great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur two very assisting stars who help make this movie. The sharp look between you may just see Gabby Hayes as an Indian Scout, there is also a very young Anthony Quinn making his debut as a Cayenne warrior, he actually married one of the Demilles daughters in real life. Cooper of the Custer massacre said in flashback, the ending is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the American West with American history. Please take the time to watch this classic western.
