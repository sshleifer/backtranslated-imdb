CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" kittens embarking on a bizarre journey through the afterlife where anything can happen. This short-minded Asian does not use dialogues, replacing balloons. There is no way to describe this demented drawing except to tell you to see for yourself. And make sure that no one under the age of 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and insensitive disrespect for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kittens swim through and in, and also ride. But, like practically all the rest of the film, this silly and picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end.
