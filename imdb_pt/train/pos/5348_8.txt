Another great Arnold movie. This futuristic film has great action and is one of the best films of Arnie. Arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a death game. This movie is great and a great science fiction / action movie. I've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies ever. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
