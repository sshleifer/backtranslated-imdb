The previous reviewer said exactly. I saw it once, I was blown away, I saw a second time when it was re-broadcast within a week or two of the first showing. I still remember some of the scenes. The setting is the opening of the 20th century, the war referred to in the title is the First World War. One of the scenes was set in a female only section of a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The time when one of the women first plays the other is one of my great movie moments of all time. I do not think of it as a "gay movie", it's an interesting and delicate love story where the two directors are women. I would love to see this movie again; I would buy this one if it ever came out on DVD.
