This movie definitely gets a positive signal from me. It's witty jokes and even occasional derogatory stereotypical visions about people from Eastern Europe left me in spots for most of the film. The plot is clever and 100% original and will make you guess throughout the movie. The only person who impressed me most about this movie was Hilary Duff. It is clear and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith out of the chick-flick genre she is accustomed to. His accent is excellent and his acting performance was surprisingly sharp and well executed. It's the best performance I've ever seen of Hilary, and I've seen most of her films. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah is described as 'Britney Spears from Eastern Europe' and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and in the song, 'I want to blow you ... ... up'. You also feel sorry for her, as her performance really catches you, Yonica is a very complex and confusing character. Joan Cusack made me laugh all through the movie with her sometimes funny humor but also her facial expressions and so on. The witty dialogue of John Cusack will probably make you laugh. I strongly recommend this movie.
