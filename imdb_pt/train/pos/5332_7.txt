In the light of negative criticism - or car accidents - I feel possessed to get in gear and do a broadcast to give credit where it is due, and do a service. I'm not sure if people are allowed to say it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to have SUSPENSE. This movie kept suspense is the entire length, for me, despite any flaws that may be. How many movies can say that? Not even many big ones. Because of the simple premise, you do not know if people will get out of life-threatening situation, which lasts the entire movie. Yeh, the suspension was tight, and over a few bumps the shocks did their job. It's not just a TV movie, but a full-length action movie; there is no point in stopping, deflecting, or becoming a talisman. It would be difficult to make such a movie, always on the road. Just dueling, or speed, that's what I remember. The best thing about them was constant tension. <br /> <br /> AGIR is not bad: The Judge is as good as ever, and the others are. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury is out if sometimes it can be - or seems to be - a little wrong. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily so. His early judgments are not always right, but I think the lead actor was right about being in this movie. <br /> <br /> STUNTS are mostly great, especially for a TV movie. Its only flaw may be perceived speed and, again, apparent, slow. But we all know how deceptively slow the Grand Prix cars can look like. <br /> <br /> I liked what HOME said, "inspired by a true story". So you're not going to how true it is? You just know the base is. The usual "based on a true story" makes me think that it should be true. But maybe that's my mistake. <br /> <br /> HOW TO SAVE: A good idea for the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the rear wheels. Only a few inches would fit. A stunt double could do that at 100 mph. It's strange that they have not called a car specialist - or an electrician or car mechanic - to see if there is a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review has put in reverse order that this movie is a disaster. Or at least neutral. And help to become a great success. <br /> <br /> The quality of the photo is a bit soft for a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have been stolen after the baby, but strangely. The idea of ​​saving lives was cleverly addressed in some conversations to slow down. I think we know why. End of the movie Suspension of disbelief left the upper window with the baby.
