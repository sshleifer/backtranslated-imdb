Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (like Chavez) who supports poor people in his country can be held in such low esteem in the United States. Your worst "sin", in my opinion, is caring about those at the bottom of the barrel. What could be so bad about that? I've always been fascinated by the US government + media reaction to Fidel Castro. In the beginning, Castro was a nice guy (around 1959) when he overcame Batista. Soon, however, Castro began to turn corporations into Cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and our government have such a big problem of sharing with the poor? If these guys are "dictators," then we could use more "dictatorships," especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
