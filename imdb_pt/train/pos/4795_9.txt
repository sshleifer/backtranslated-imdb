Whenever I hear a movie being shown because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects and so on, my bs. the detector switches off. Generally, a movie like this is a sentimental bullshit that favors people who do not want anything that surprises them, but to assert how they are superior to us, cowardly people. So when David Lynch's THE STRAIGHT STORY began to get these types of reviews, I was apprehensive, especially as I was not a fan of his other "uplifting" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN. For all the impressive images and good acting in the film, he seemed more interested in preaching than inspiring us. <br /> <br /> I did not need to worry. STRAIGHT HISTORY is an honest movie instead of saccharine. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and the writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney say it directly and simply most of the time. There are some Straight homilies I could have done without, and the doses of grains being picked up are repeated a little too much, but these are just little messages. There are no heavy messages, no sentimental strings to shake our emotions, and no condescension toward us and their characters. Instead, they depend on history to build their own power, and that happens, then, in the final scene, we are genuinely moved. <br /> <br /> Of course climbing Richard Farnsworth adds realism to the role. He really is someone who seems to have lived a lot, but still perseveres, and except for these homilies, the desire he has to return with his brother does not seem overly sentimental, because you may feel that here is someone who also lived long and seen too much to be driven by anger for a long time. And he knows his time is running out, so he wants to make some peace, not just with his brother, but with his life. Sissy Spacek also does a good job unhandled as Straight's daughter. And although I am a city and a suburban kid, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscape is beautifully filmed, making me want to at least visit one day.
