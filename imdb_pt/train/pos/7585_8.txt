This is a strange, cerebral, surreal and esoteric film. If there is such a thing as "intellectual horror cinema," this movie is that. I started to get scared and wanted to have someone else watching with me, and there's hardly a plot! I'll have to see this movie again several times before I feel like I really understand it. If you're the kind of person who likes "My Dinner with Andrew" and Godard's movies, or if you do a lot of mind-altering drugs, you'll probably like this movie. Wow.
