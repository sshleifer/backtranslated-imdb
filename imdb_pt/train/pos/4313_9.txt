The Grand Canyon falls into a very scarce category: it's a very clever film, with very clever dialogues and good reflection everywhere from start to finish. I have the impression that it has never reached the well-deserved ranking (and never will be) due to its simplicity. This type of film needs sensitive observers. Too bad that IMDb makes me write ten lines, because that's not necessary in this particular case. Anyway, in order to fulfill this request, I will tell you what the weak point of the film, if any is in the acting: not that bad, but could have been done much better. Exception made for Kevin Kline, who was perfect. Go ahead and watch.
