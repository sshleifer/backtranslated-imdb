Without being one of my favorites, this is good for being a change of pace ... even if only for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a big fight between Tom, Jerry and Spike (which is renamed "Butch" here). They are all hitting each other, but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision: he stops the fight and suggests that everyone should be friends. So they all sign a peace treaty and become friends ... which will not last for long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the three become affectionate, patient and kind to each other. They even save themselves when one of them is in danger of life. The relationship is nothing short of excellent, until a very large steak appears and everyone becomes greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their usual struggles and rivalries. <br /> <br /> But still ... seeing Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends is truly a pleasant and rewarding experience, even if for a while. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, as a curious fact, two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" are played here in instrumental versions: "We're out to see the Wizard" and "Somewhere over the Rainbow".
