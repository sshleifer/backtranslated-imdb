An absorbing (though repetitive, and quite didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or forward, where attempts to feel better violating and knocking down those below you seems to be the only option. But even here, in this desolate desert of lost dreams and without a future, that does not work, and reach something or someone to comfort and share, a simple act of charity, gives some reward, even if only make the present bearable, reliving memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is little violence on the screen, this is a hard and brutal movie about the small oppressive (political and personal) mentality that does not facilitate entertainment. . Clearly based on a play, with a small cast, a broader and more expansive relationship with the overall social and political environment would have possibly helped the film reach a wider audience.
