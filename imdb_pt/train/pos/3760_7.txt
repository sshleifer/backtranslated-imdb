It may not have been for the awards of the academy and, admittedly, is very tacky, but it's a lot of fun! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Lovely, upbeat and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I adore Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is funnier to me. Death is hilarious and Bill and Ted are even more affectionate. People pity me for loving this movie, but only the pretentious moviegoers will say it's not at all funny. If you like that, you'll probably also be a fan of Wayne's World, Cara's My Car, and Dumb and Dumber. Admit it, though foolish, they make you smile and turn your tickling box. Then watch them just for kicks and laughs !!
