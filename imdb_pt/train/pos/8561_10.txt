When two writers make a script for a horror version of Breakfast At Tiffany's, you know something is going to work out. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes in which Patrick looked Holly up and down like some kind of objectifier were strange. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a big part. The strange gummy worm was strange. Nathan was a very handsome cat. But what was that scene when Patrick followed Holly into a cesspool, and Mr. Gooding attacked him? What about the scene with Dr. Wallace? What was he doing out there? And not every man has a female, as Sally Kellerman has stated. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew out of Victor, that was odd.
