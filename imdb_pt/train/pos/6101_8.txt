So I will not ruin everything for you, I will be very brief. There are some great performances and funny lines from the attractive cast. A young Harvard Med School graduate (Brian White) learns he does not know as much as he thinks about people. He goes to a small hospital in Florida for his internship because a girlfriend (Mya) left him to work as a TV producer. His Senior Resident (Wood Harris), helped marvelously by his "creative collaborator" (Zoe Saldana), put it into practice. They help protect his career and show him the broader possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor rather than a player who just wants to make money (as seems to be true for many of my pre-medical friends).
