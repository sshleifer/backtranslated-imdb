Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits in his name, including some real duds such as the Cold War satire, Bland, The Day the Fish Came Out. Iphigenia, however, is a standout. Adapted by Cacoyannis from Euripides' play, it is a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made his first television appearance in many years in the United States, courtesy of the Flix Channel. The film is filmed on an epic scale, but it is decidedly not a "big" movie, with the emphasis placed on simple story: in pleading with the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou) to the great consternation of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both excellent, but it is the impressive Papamoschou that brings the most interesting elements to the screen, blending the innocence of childhood with the perception that she is the pawn in a political game. Strongly recommended for international film fans.
