Very slow, but intricately structured, and finally very touching. A cool and very real look at a small beach town in Florida in the middle of winter - I've been there, and that's absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> It's also the actress's debut. Ashley Judd, and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in theaters and recently renting "Ruby" again. Except for the 80s, he resisted very well. Ashely is so radiant and touching here, that it's hard to think of her subsequent career without shuddering. Boy, talk about not keeping your initial promise! Anyone who saw Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" would presume that this elegant and natural beauty went to all sorts of interesting art films and serious acting - on the contrary, she became the go-to girl for action movies and slasher! Very disappointing, but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to show its initial promise. <br /> <br /> As some commentators say, this is not for everyone, as it is very slow. This is not an action movie, nor is it really a novel. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent character study) treats this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect, allowing her story to be built slowly and in great detail. So I think this is one of the most exciting and respectful ripening stories about young women I remember - not about Ruby's sexual awakening or "how she lost her virginity," but about her life choices. and its increasing maturity. <br /> <br /> A lovely film, if you take the time to watch it ... I think it would be a really great movie to show teenagers and young girls (or boys). and give them a chance to think and argue about it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to director Nunez, who also wrote the screenplay, which is so realistic and detailed that I assumed throughout the film he was based. in a novel or memoir written by women, but in fact it is the original work of Nunez. Rated 8 out of 10.
