This is a really cool movie! I remember seeing him when I was very young and used to watch him all the time, once a week ... Shadow was my favorite character in the movie. Homeward Bound is really funny and it's really cool as they train the animals to do all these things. Parts of the movie are sad (like when Sassy the cat falls from the waterfall, and when Shadow falls into the hole at the end.) I've seen the second Homeward Bound, but I have to say it's not as good as the first. Sassy is the smart one, Sassy is, well, Sassy, ​​and Chance is the funny idiot. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies or talking animals. This is one of my ten favorite movies!
