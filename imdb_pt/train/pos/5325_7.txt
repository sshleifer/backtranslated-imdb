The idea of ​​making a movie about the Beatles seems a fated idea, since no production can capture the idea of ​​the true historical Beatles. So maybe it's best not to try to recreate the past, but produce an illustration that works best with the other available Beatles materials. That is exactly what 'Birth of the Beatles' offers us, the simple story that is known to us without any extravagance. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here in *** warned that not everything is as accurate as some Beatles graduates might expect. The Beatles are seen playing songs that would hardly be composed until then. The Beatles play "Ask Me Why", "P.S. I Love You" and "Do not Bother Me". The Beatles graduates should see that if the Beatles in the film only presented songs they actually did in Hamburg, younger viewers would no longer recognize the Beatles who learned to know them. From this original Hamburg repertoire, only "Johnny B. Goode" and "Love Me Tender" by Stu Sutcliffe are kept. <br /> <br /> The guys who play The Beatles in this production hardly look like the original, but the rest of the film still makes a good preview, since the film is pretty accurate for the rest. The guy who plays Lennon does well and the rest of the band is not bad either. Brian Epstein is great and the moment he knocks Pete Best out of the group is probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie. Also as a bonus you can see the original Cavern club in the movie.
