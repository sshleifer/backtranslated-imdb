When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed on the screen. His greatness caught my attention in such a way that I concentrated all my attention on it for the whole duration. I would recommend seeing it not just for anime fans but for anyone who likes a great period of movies (or who likes really weird stuff). The style of the art is beautiful, the sound is perfect and the symbolism inside it is breathtaking. I've heard complaints about the strange insertion of the English text into the film, but I think the way it's done complements the strange style of the film. The self-described description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions. I would like to find more work from those who did this and see them.
