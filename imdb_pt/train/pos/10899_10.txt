I laughed so hard during this movie that my face hurt. Ben Affleck was hilarious and I remembered a handsome boy, Jack Black, in that role. Gandolfini gives his typical presentation in A. All the cast is funny, the story is very good and the comic moments impressive. I entered this movie not expecting much, maybe so I was so surprised to leave the film completely satisfied and completely exhausted. I recommend this movie for those who enjoy comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and / or put up with relatives. The best part for this movie (for me anyway) were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and made me laugh a lot after the rest of the audience stopped. That is, the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree. Go and have a good laugh!
