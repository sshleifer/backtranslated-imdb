Let's simplify: my two children were stuck in this movie. It has its flaws from an adult's point of view, but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And the Pepsi girl was great! <br /> <br /> And Kimberly Williams was very hot, although not in the movie, so do not get too excited there. <br /> <br /> Not that it's really a bad thing, but it's the kind of movie you watch only once. Do not buy the DVD. <br /> <br /> Have fun! <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the parents.)
