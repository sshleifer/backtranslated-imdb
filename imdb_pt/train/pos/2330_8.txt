This show is good. I like the acting, the funny parts and the cuteness of it. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, they all did very well on the show. The show began very well with its basic, funny and illogical idea of ​​bringing dead people back to the first series and honestly, like what people said, the first episodes of the second series were a bit disappointing but later came back good anyway. And now I really hate the fact that this will be canceled. Why does ABC not let up until the end when all the episodes are ready? I really want to know how the story will be. I think it should be given a chance because there are still so many viewers who love it.
