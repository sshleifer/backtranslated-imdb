It's always a good surprise when a movie made for TV turns out to be fun, like Little Richard. This is a very watchable movie about the history of Rock and Roller, Little Richard played by an actor named Leon, whom I have never seen before, but does a very good job. Like most TV movies, this is a tamer than if made for Cinema, which is a shame because I'm sure there's much we could have seen about Little Richard, who was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious junk, which is the only thing that spoils the film and ended up spoiling a very promising career. After all, this movie is good and the acting is above average for a TV movie. 7 out of 10.
