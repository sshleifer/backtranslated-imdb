I've seen this movie more than once now, and there's always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot afterwards. But then - this is part of Petzold's game: he plays along with the rules of the genre. <br /> <br /> It's great to see how the highly improbable story of how the two girls (Timothy / Hummer) meet is again mirrored in yet another unlikely story that girls make up a cast. This film is a journey between fact and fiction, it's more about potentials, things that could have happened in the past or could be happening in the future, than about real events. It is a daydream, kind - so skilful that there are many motives, which Freud might have found interesting for the analysis of his dreams, like all "doppelganger" -constellations. <br /> <br /> In addition, I think "Gespenster" may be interesting to watch in comparison to the current Asian cinema of the stranger: Petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in a discreet and strangely familiar way . This movie is not about the obvious. Describing it as the story of two girls who know each other and eventually become friends and lovers, or like the story of an orphaned mother, who seeks in Europe for her lost daughter, clearly does not say much about the nature of "Gespenster." .
