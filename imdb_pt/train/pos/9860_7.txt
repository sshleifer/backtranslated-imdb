This movie had no parts that were hilarious, mostly just ordinary funny units, but it also had no part that was really bad. The worst part was Sid's voice. His slothy slur was too much for me. For about 5 minutes I was tired of hearing him speak. In addition to the annoying voice of laziness, the movie was good. There were numerous secondary jokes that, if you catch them, make the movie a lot better. This is a good movie for kids. It has enough to keep the content adult and enough to entertain children. This is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.
