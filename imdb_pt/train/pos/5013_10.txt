If people did not know who Barbra Streisand was before that ... (is that POSSIBLE?) ... they sure knew who she was behind! <br /> <br /> This show has won 5 Emmys, & stands out as one of the best things Streisand has ever done. <br /> <br /> It consists of 3 acts ... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra singing the standards from room to room, full of musicians, including a segment where she is a girl again, all ending with a splendid version of his signature song, (at the time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings songs of poverty ... it's better than it seems ... <br /> <br /> ACT III. .... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs, like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again", and a "Funny Girl" medley. > All in all, a great part of television history, made by one of the greatest artists in the world!
