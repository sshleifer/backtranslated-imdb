Robert Stack has never lost an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Kyle in "Written on the Wind," with Anthony Quinn's 12-year performance in "Lust for Life." Stack plays the deeply disturbed son and alcoholic of an oil tycoon. He lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They both love the same woman, Lucy (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunken slut who is in love with Mitch. His story unfolds in glorious colors under the direction of Douglas Sirk, who has truly mastered the field of melodrama with some incredible films including "Imitation of Life," "All That Heaven Allows," "Magnificent Obsession," and many others. Do not make a mistake - this is a potboiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone get the most out of their roles, Malone winning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. There is an incredible scene, mentioned in other comments, in which she dances wildly with loud music while her father falls and dies on the stairs. We're led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy who pumps the gas, because she's in love with Mitch. Mitch does not want anything to do with her. He is so in love with Lucy that, out of loyalty to Kyle, he wants to go to work in Iran to avoid temptation. I doubt he was so eager to get there today, no matter how much he was in love. Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who's been cleaning up Kyle's Mexe all his life, and Bacall's the wife of Mitch, who sees himself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety. Sirk focuses on the more volatile players. In Sirk's hands, "Written on the Wind" is an effective film, and the big scene around the end of the mansion is particularly exciting. The director had a gift for this type of film and, despite having many imitators, never had an equal.
