Hello Playmates. I recently watched this movie for the first time and it is also my first experience of Arthur Askey, I have to admit that I was very impressed with this movie. As a fan of black and white films in general, passport to pimlico, the crowd of lavender hill and Tommy Trinder (who is apparently a distant relative), this movie appealed to the extent that from good old fashioned British humor. I realize that there are some here that have criticized Askey's performance, however, in my opinion, he is the test of time as a good example of the comic act of the forties and if something adds to the image by creating characters that are more than mere stereotypes that seem to dominate both the movies now. If you can get hold of this movie, I would recommend you to notice, shame these movies are usually no longer on Sunday afternoons. I am also happy to have had the opportunity to watch another play. by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in his father's army).
