I'm a fan of C & C, going back to their albums, and enjoyed this movie, but at one point in the mid-1980s on cable television in San Jose, California, it was screened with an alternate plot that destroyed the whole point of the movie. All references to marijuana have been replaced by "diamonds". The bag that "Red" drops for Chong has diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation remains the same ("... worth ~ $ 3000 / lb"). There is also a subplot in which alien clips on a ship were added observing C & C, and talking about how to get the diamonds. In the end, instead of "space coke", it's something else. I'm not sure who created this version, but it was horrible and obvious that they were trying to make it family friendly / child friendly. It would have been better if this network had not been transmitted.
