In Iran, women are not admitted to football matches. Officially, it is because they should be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it's about sexism. Women are inferior forms of human beings. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose this and try to enter the stadium using different tricks. They are caught by soldiers and held in a kind of cage until the police come to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Despite the insane situation, this is a very humorous movie. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways to combat oppression. You will be touched while giving lots of laughs. Good job by director Jafar Panahi. This is, in many ways, a heroic comedy.
