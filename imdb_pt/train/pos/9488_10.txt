Highly memorable, intelligent and suspenseful film of one of the true geniuses of the French films, the formidable Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel to JFK's murder, and occurs in a non-descriptive and fictitious country. The film, visually and in terms of plot, is extremely sharp. Filmed with meticulous precision, follows Henry Volnay, the Prosecutor who strives to unravel the coup. In many ways, it is a very disturbing film, no less important to the cold and analytical precision of his commentary on the inner workings of the so-called modern state. The atmosphere and the characters are totally believable, and Verneuil left nothing to chance in his tight plot. On another level, this relatively unknown film only had a 15-year lead over Oliver Stone, who was acclaimed for the film "JFK," an inferior film in many areas, the least of which is not credibility ... It's a masterpiece , any moviegoer should see it, preferably in its original French version with subwoofers.
