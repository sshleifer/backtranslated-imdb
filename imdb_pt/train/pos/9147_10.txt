As a big fan of Prince for the last three to four years, I really can not believe I just watched "Purple Rain". The new special edition 2-disc anniversary led me to buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to watching it, but I was not prepared for how electric it really is. Prince's musical performances throughout the film are nothing short of surprising - he REALLY has the moves in this. I'm very familiar (from repeated auditions) with the classic album "Purple Rain" and all of their songs but seeing them in the context of the movie completely changes their perception of the songs and lyrics - like BLUE COMPUTER, THE BEAUTIFUL, WHEN DOVAS CALLS and PURPLE RAIN itself. There is something indescribably mesmerizing about the scenes in which Prince and the Revolution act. The closing songs BABY I'M THE STAR AND I'LL DIE TO U show how much energy and talent Prince was overflowing in his early 20s (he is overflowing!), This surprised me. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years. <br /> <br /> Prince shows how to conquer the girl of your dreams - take her to a lake, make her jump, and then leave - absolutely hilarious things in retrospect. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes are much of the 1980s and unintentionally hilarious, but this contributes to the overall charm of the film. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and when his group The Time does THE BIRD, you see Morris Day and Jerome Benton lighting up the stage. Minneapolis funk style - I love their dance in this part, and how Benton offers Morris a mirror in the middle of the performance. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to watch it again, I really can not! Extras are great - particularly seeing a young police officer Eddie Murphy pre-beverly Hills admit he is a "groupie Prince".
