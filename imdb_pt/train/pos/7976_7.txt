Revenge is the theme of this thriller by Denzel Washington, which offers its share of action, disorder, murder and bloody sangria. The essential is the search and destruction of a bodyguard, while his young, Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school, exactly what Washington was hired to avoid. The locations of Mexico City are as chaotic as the plot moves toward its predictable and violent conclusion, with plots along the way. Washington, a former CIA agent facing problems with drinking, gets a good reference from a former agent in the group who sets the plot in motion. Washington and Fanning have great chemistry between them and after a troublesome start, the bodyguard and his charge become best friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke make up the good cast in support of the two stars.
