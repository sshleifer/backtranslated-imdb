I liked this movie, maybe because I had not seen any comments, etc. It was delicious and a bit of a 'joke'. I do not know why you did not do more than that. As for the story, I could relate to some aspects of Paul Reiser's character, and I could "see my father" in Falk's character. It reminded me of a lot of times when I was a kid and heard my grandparents too. If you liked movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. A "sleeper", in my opinion, and one of those well-being stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal fights, but nothing was exaggerated. I would say rates at least an 8, maybe higher.
