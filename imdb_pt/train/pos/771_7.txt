I watched the movie along with a homophobic friend, my wife and her friend. Then I had visions of all sorts of directions. Mainly, the movie made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only notable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just did not have complex roles. I applaud Puya getting into the movie business. I do not know why, but I think he's a nice guy, I just hope he's a good actor. <br /> <br /> The wife loved the movie, and I think there may have been chords being played and for which I had not heard. If the film attempted to exhibit unusual sexual behaviors and its consequences in today's Romania, then it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Imagine that the girls are really a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring and uninteresting plot. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why she has won all BAFTA awards. In my book, I should have been awarded the "Better luck next time" award. (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
