At first glance, I expected this movie to be bad because I thought the plot would be so overly feminist. But I was wrong. As you may have read in previously published reviews, I agree that the feminist part in this movie does not bother. I never got the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman. It's how Guzman is presented as someone with a column, this in contrast to his classmates. So, I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was very good, except for the foreseeable end. Perhaps it was a better idea to give a radical twist on the plot, so that the viewer is a little more surprised. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would say that Rodriguez deserved his respect for the way she put her character. I can not really explain why, but especially in the love scenes, she convinced me. It looked real, I guess. <br /> <br /> I gave her 7 out of 10, just because of the last half hour.
