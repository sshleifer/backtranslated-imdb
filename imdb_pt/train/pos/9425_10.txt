A super comedy series from the 1990s (two series were made in total) that suffered in the UK ratings due to bad scheduling. When you come across comedies set as 'Minder', even the best new comedies will struggle to get noticed. <br /> <br /> Luckily, I picked up the first episode series and followed it eagerly. I mentioned this to friends and family at the time, but everyone seemed to be watching something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I loved both series and never forgot. <br /> <br /> So I searched the internet and found that an ultra-fan was trying to get both series released "on their own." <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
