I saw this movie on cable, it was very funny, from stereotype police chief to stereotype great villains, jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part. I compare this movie to "Rush Hour," in which a local police officer has to associate with an Asian police officer to solve a case. The chase for the farmers market in downtown Detroit brings back memories. Nice soundtrack, good script, I give 10/10.
