This was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in IMDb), but he made a great matchmaker. He brought together two very cool people played by two of the best actors working. The supporting cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on the screen and made it a great viewing experience. The fact that he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those pictures and posters of him riding his bike to get around. And he wore socks on a scene ... supposedly, the teacher never wore socks! (Two new entries to IMDb's goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, this was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give an 8!
