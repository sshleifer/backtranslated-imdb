Action, horror, science fiction, director of exploration Fred Olen Ray shows that he has some talent as a director. Actor William Smith is one of the best tough guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career. As for Randy Travis, he gives his best impression of Lee Van Cleef. He's not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make the movie. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stand out. Ray did a great job directing this movie, Smith and Travis were good, I would give that B western on a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) a seven.
