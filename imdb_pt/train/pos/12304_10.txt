This is a great movie. I like it when ning goes down to get his ink, and the skeletons chase after him, but luckily he dodges them, opens the window and does not even notice. xiao qian is very beautiful too. and when he shoved the needle into Wu's ass, he was hysterical. and when he is saying that love is the greatest thing on earth, while standing between two swords is great too. then also the part where he eats his loaves while watching the guy killing many people. so you see him singing poems as he ran to escape the wolves. the love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning seem cute together. add comic timing, the giant tongue, and you have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention excellent special effects for the 1990s.
