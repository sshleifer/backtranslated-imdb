The film looked like a passage for "Immoral Study." Most likely, I have never really gotten involved with the fiery need of the female artist to immortalize male nudes and thus all that fuss about "Now who drew this penis ?!" sounded a bit free. Dialogues in this movie are pretty awful, although visually this movie has its moments. I almost dug when Tassi began to paint a mental image, but then the film returned to the penis. Highly recommended to those who have not seen one in a while.
