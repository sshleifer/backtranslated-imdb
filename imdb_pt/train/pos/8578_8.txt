This movie is one of the best American B movies of the 90s. If you are looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some action, lots of laughs, and a variation on the language of cops who are fighting gangsters, it is worth watching. Everyone chews the scenery a bit, but that's what the movie is about, and everyone is pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to make another movie together.
