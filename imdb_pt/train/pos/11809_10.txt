Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic book fans because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocence of being just a comic book with villains who have serious clutter appearance and be fun. Warren Beatty directs and stars as the main character who fights crime without using super powers. I liked Dick Tracy since I was a child, because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. This is the perfect movie for anyone to watch with their kids. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with enthusiasm. Madonna as the baby who is the second villain in this movie does not play the same toy she represents. Like I said, no blood, obscenities, sexual innuendoes or anything to offend anyone.
