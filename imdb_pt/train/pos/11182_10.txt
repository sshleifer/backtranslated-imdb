I'm a big fan of most movies that were based on Stephen King's books - this ranks as one of the scariest and most memorable. <br /> <br /> I just re-watched it around the tenth. time and I still think it is heart-wrenching as well as scary. <br /> <br /> The scene where Gage is on a collision course with the monster truck is one that stands out. And the "No fair" given by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
