This movie is so much fun. What makes him especially good are two things: one is the direct way the characters embrace stereotypes, with discussions about their costumes and superpowers. There is a captivating seriousness in the parody that is very attractive; the second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves a special note as the object of Mr. Furious's wishes. There's a lot of talent here. I realize that some with high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is a lot of fun and half sweet.
