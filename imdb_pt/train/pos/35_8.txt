When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and the terrible statuette of the Red Queen, I was sure I was in for a big disappointment, but surprise, surprise, I loved it. Deceitful trickery, of course and unforgivable, that such a complicated turn-around should be rushed to the point where you can barely read the captions, much less accept the ridiculous explanation. Such disagreements, however, the film is a dream. Fabulous ladies in fabulous costumes in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly moving and accompanied by a wonderful score by Bruno Nicolai. He may not be the Morricone, but in these lighter chunks he may be. Really nice with a lot of color, a lot of sensuality, some bloody deaths and minimal police interference. Super.
