I would not call "We're Back! The Story of a Dinosaur" simply a children's version of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. Like the first, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from an era to ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase this: a certain actor, the "Cheers" woman, the Tonight Show host, the Most Trusted Name of News, a famous chef, the "Young Frankenstein" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Friends and the CNN face. <br /> <br /> But I guess I should not just focus on the cast. I thought this movie had something for kids (purely fun) and adults (natural history). It's true, it's escapism, but the perceptive type. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work on "Monsters Inc." Worth seeing.
