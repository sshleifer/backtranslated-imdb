If you liked Roman Polanski's "Repulsion," you should probably check out "The Tenant," since it's a similar concept, with only Polanski coming in and playing the schizophrenic wacko. This is actually one of my favorites of his films - second, after "Baby Rosemary", of course - and is a direct trip to the mental collapse of a man who moves to the old apartment of a suicide victim. The other residents of the building are all weird and impassive in keeping the noise level down - even the smallest 'titter' becomes a big deal and Polanski, who stars, becomes increasingly paranoid and succumbs to his hallucinations more and more. more while the movie takes in. It gets to the point where he is dressing and acting like the ex-tenant and you realize that it is only a matter of time before he decides to stage his fatal jump through the window ... The movie is a bit slow and time-consuming for a while , but if you've ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, you should know it will end with a bang and this movie does not disappoint. It's also best if you do not question the intricacies of the premise and just take it as a descent into madness because sometimes it's quite surreal. Polanski is very good as the shy and troubled resident who somehow attracts the ever illustrious Isabelle Adjani. We can also see him running around, which is disturbing and hilarious, all at the same time! Damn, he does to an ugly girl! So Polanski's fans - who can really go through their 30-year pedophile accusations - should seize "The Tenant" as a fun psychological trip ...
