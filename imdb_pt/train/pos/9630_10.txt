I've seen Dirty Work several times and it's probably my favorite Stan and Ollie short. <br /> <br /> In this, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweepers and get the job of cleaning the chimney at Professor Noodle's house (Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle is doing crazy experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos by trying to clean the chimney and make a mess in the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a special formula tank that Noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp! The best part is where Ollie falls through the chimney and a pile of bricks falls on his head, but he does not seem to suffer much from it. <br /> <br /> Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie not the funniest. Great fun. <br /> Rating: 5 stars of 5.
