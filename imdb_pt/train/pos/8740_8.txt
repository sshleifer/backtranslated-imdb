There is great detail in the life of an insect. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. The film is not so terribly original, it's basically a modern version of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, with only bugs. I liked the character interaction however and the bad guys in this movie really looked bad. It seems Disney often makes its bad guys cut carbon copies. The locusts are menacing and Hopper, the bad guy leader, was a brilliant creation. Check this one out.
