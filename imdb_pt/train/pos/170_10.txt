Do not listen to fuddy-duddy critics on this one, this is a gem! The rich young Joan and her brother get lost after the father dies - and now they have to work to live! She, of course, becomes a reporter and he, of course, a driver of the mob! By wild co-incidents their careers meet head on, thanks to gangster Clark Gable. Meanwhile, there is a chance for an underwear to moonlight swim for a lot of beautiful things and for Joan to make a pair of spicy dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam shovel). <br /> <br /> But none of this should be taken seriously - it's all so much fun on those wonderful pre-coded days when Hollywood was really disobedient. Joan looks great, and shows much of the emotional reach that would give her such longevity (thank goodness she stopped dancing!). Gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he was not a star yet and he did not have to be the hero. Great to see him playing something different. And William Bakewell is excellent as the poor confused brother. And there are some great mounts and accompanying shots, courtesy of director Harry Beaumont, who moves the piece with a frantic pace - and an occasional wink to the audience! Great fun!
