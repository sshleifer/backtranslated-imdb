A young cat tries to steal the soul of his brothers from death, but only gets half and then has to venture to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm not sure what happens in this movie, which is full of very strange, very surreal images, some of which parents may find disturbing (that is, cats cutting part of a pig that is traveling with them and frying like bacon that all three eat). <br /> <br /> This is a very strange movie that some have compared to Hello Kitty in acid, I think it is more like Hello Kitty as done by Dali. (Certainly this is more alive than Destiny, which was directly based on his work). <br /> <br /> If you're ready for a very uncommon movie that will challenge your perceptions of things, then watch this movie. Just be ready for some very strange images that will be etched in your memory forever. <br /> <br />
