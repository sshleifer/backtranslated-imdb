I had never heard of this movie before a few weeks ago, but its concept interested me when I heard it: an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking. It piqued my interest, but I never expected it to be that good. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, and is also one of the most romantic movies ever recorded. To my surprise, he completely missed the cynicism of the 90's. It's impossible to say much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are many interesting things you can talk about, it's like my dinner with Andr√©, where there is a conversation, but it's not just the conversation that matters), but let me just say, see. LOOK!
