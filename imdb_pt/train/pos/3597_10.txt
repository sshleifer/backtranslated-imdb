(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was impressed by this movie. I've been renting in movielink a bit and decided to check out this movie. Many boxing movies seem to exaggerate in the blood. In this movie, show it at armor level. Although I wish that perhaps more attention has been brought to maybe she will improve her grades. The film points out the problems that some families face with the genre. <br /> <br /> I was a little worried about the ending. But the ending was not a disappointment either. <br /> <br /> I think it was clear from the title that she would win. The unexpected was that the two returned together at the end. <br /> <br /> I loved the score in some scenes. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Replayable: 10/10
