Wonderland is the fascinating film that chronicles the involvement of porn star John C. Holmes in the brutal murders of Wonderland. <br /> <br /> The promotion of the movie fools the person into thinking that this is a romanticized portrait of the porn industry in the vein of the film. Boogie Nights and this is not the case here. In fact, except for some references made by journalists that John Holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of real life scenes from John Holmes this film is strictly drama about the involvement of a fallen celebrity with murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite being deceptive the film is really engaging. The acting of the whole cast is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is incredible in his ability to descend All mannerisms of John Holmes. I was completely convinced that I was watching what John Holmes probably looked and acted like in real life. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of John C. Holmes or like stories about Hollywood then I think you will enjoy watching Wonderland.
