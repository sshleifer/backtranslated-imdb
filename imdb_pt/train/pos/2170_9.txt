I think the creator (s) of the concept of this film deserves far more praise than they have probably received. It's not an Oscar-caliber film, of course, but, at least for me, this movie left a lasting impression since the first time I saw it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think this is (and hopefully not) a spoiler, but: imagine acting according to your impulses. Making the first thought that comes into your head, saying the first words on your lips ... No restriction, no consciousness, nothing stopping you from saying or doing things that, as intelligent adults, we know we should not say or do. If anything, this movie just scratches the surface - it does not go as far as it could go. <br /> <br /> In a time when Hollywood seems obsessed with remaking old "classics" to try to make money these days, would not it be nice to see them remake an older movie of modest success? leading to the next level? A little further, or even to explore what the original crew did not have, or could not handle 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> That's just my opinion anyway. : O)
