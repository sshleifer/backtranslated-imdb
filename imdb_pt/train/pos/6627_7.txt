A Darkly Scanner, Minority Report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow? if you are a fan of any of these then it is worth checking out. <br /> <br /> The French animation project 'Renaissance' took seven years to be done on a tight budget and today I finally got to see it at a private screening for the Stockholm International Film Festival. My spontaneous reaction is admiration; my further reflection is "huh, neat" and the nearest analysis regrettably gets a resonant "meh." It's a beautiful triumph of science fiction on the surface, but scratch it or even poke it a bit and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes clearly visible, just like the flat characters. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the people of Onyx did something spectacular with the surface mentioned. The visuals are amazing. They used live action motion capture set in key frame animation, with brilliant black-and-white contrast and a heavily shaded rotoscoping background. For those who do not have the technical jargon, the movie looks like a Sin City totally lively. Its fluid, transparent, dark and stylized model is complemented by a great lightening. It is a vision. Still, a lot of credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of futuristic weapons, suspense music, heavy raindrops and broken glass shards. It's the wet dream of every technology nerd ... <br /> <br /> The film zooms into a futuristic, somber, somber Paris, in which a large corporation called 'Avalon' began to intertwine in the lives of citizens with vigilance (think of the fluid transparency screens of the Minority Report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher Ilona (voiced by the lovely Romola Garai). Cut to our hard cop-on-suspension and protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig)? a man who takes the law into his own hands? who is attributed the case of finding and recovering Ilona. During this case, he is being aided by Illona's sister, with whom he also initiates a love affair. A very average love affair, if I may say so. <br /> <br /> The world of the Renaissance is remarkable. Director Christian Volckman makes a number of criticisms about the fusion of noir themes and the result is an urban jungle full of hunters, rats, femme fatales and solitary detectives who hide in the shadows of the decadent favela. The problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled archetypes in the story, or the film would have been "too surreal" for the mainstream audience due to its lugubrious animation format. It follows, then, that we have a multitude of cliche characters, such as evil laughing villains, contemptible crime bosses, and tough girls who blow smoke every time they arise. It pushes the noir on our faces and is not necessary. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the dialogue is a little artificial. It seems that every line exists for the sole reason of pushing the plot. This is not at all fatal because the plot is so complex since it needs clear direction. Daniel Craig helps here too, bringing a meaningless attitude to his tough cop character. At one point in the Renaissance, he is seen in a vivid car chase that is certainly one of the movie's most adrenaline sequences. Unfortunately, science fiction novelties run out after this car chase and 'Renassaince' could benefit from being a bit shorter. In summary, a very interesting futuristic comic experience, but fails. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
