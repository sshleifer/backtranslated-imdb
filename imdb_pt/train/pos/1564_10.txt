Chloe is mysteriously saved from Dr. Caselli, the corrupt physician responsible for transferring patients with Belle Reve's skills to Project 33.1, and a fraction of a second later, Clark arrives. He discovers that Bart Allan returned to Smallville and they met at Kent Farm. When Bart is captured by Lex during a LuthorCorp raid, Clark discovers that Green Arrow also hired Bart (a.k.a. Impulse), Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) to investigate Project 33.1. Clark agrees to join the trio to save Bart and invites Chloe to take part in his mission. <br /> <br /> "Justice" is the best episode so far this Season 6. In this episode, the Justice League begins its saga with the association of five heroes: Clark, Green Arrow, Flash ("Impulse"), Aquaman and Cyborg. Chloe's participation is spectacular, completing the organization needed for teamwork. In the end, Oliver ends up with Lois based on the importance of fighting Lex's criminals and secret labs around the world. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Justice" ("Justice")
