It's not the same as the other dance movies. Some normal people found themselves dancing. Unlike Hollywood dance movies, the characters in this movie are not young or hot. They are someone you can see every day in their offices. They are some depressed about their lives and finally they find themselves and their dreams of dancing. That touches me very deeply.
