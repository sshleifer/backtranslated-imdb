Unlike another reviewer who said that this movie was a drug (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I disagree. <br /> <br /> This movie was awesome !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is amazing in everything she is! Yes, she may be older now, because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet, but she is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This plot can be used quite often, but it's a one-off movie and I fight whoever disagrees! I liked this movie as much as I have any other Olivia Hussey movie. Olivia is "my girl" and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw this for the first time on Saturday (4/4/07) and fell in love with it. Not only because it's an Olivia movie, but because of its wonderful history and direction.
