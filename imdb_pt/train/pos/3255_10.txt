Each scene was set up perfectly. This film had a wonderful cast and crew. I mean, how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr., none have and will never exist. He has the ability to light up any movie with his incredible talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie sitting alone on a movie shelf in "Blockbuster" and as if calling for me, I could not resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. You can call me a sentimental romantic, but this movie just touched my heart, not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time. Even though it made me cry, I admit, in the end, the whole movie just brightened my view on life after that. I suggested to my horror, action, and pure humor movie of a brother, who absolutely loved this movie. This is a movie with a good sense of feeling. It can make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love and enjoy your life. Each time you deliberately go through this movie, just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie. Who knows? What if this really could happen to you? And keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
