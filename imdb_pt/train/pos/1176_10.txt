First, let me say that I did not like the fact that The Rock won the title that is so gay. Then I feel Regal should have regained his European title, Jeff Hardy is a low quality champion. Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title a long time ago as Brock should have won. I'm happy with Storm and Christian being tagged champs, the best game was Booker T and Big Show in my opinion.
