Come on guys, look at the title! I LAUGHED A LOT! I remember seeing this movie on Saturday Late Night Creature Features years ago. It's a great extravagant flick of monsters, with hilarious bad acting and two wonderfully stupid idiots who contribute to the schlock factor. The two guys from the hired boat rental are the movie! LOL, and you'll love the scene of the boat where the English guy and his wife are talking about all the stars and it's noon and sunny. Damn hilarious !!! You could say that they just did not care about the plot, they just wanted to stop filming the movie as fast as possible. Bottom line, you'll love it if you love schlock from the 70's.
