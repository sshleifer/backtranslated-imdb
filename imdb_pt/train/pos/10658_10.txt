The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I remembered all these years because I could not sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It just shook me. I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft. Worth it, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of it for me to see as an adult. It took a lot of research to find out what the film was, but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally got the name and the reviews on it. I liked it a lot, but it scared me a lot! Jaqui
