I rarely see a movie with which I am totally absorbed; this was one of them. It had good acting, dialogue, plot and scenery was beautiful. I laughed loudly several times, especially the scene that deals with the kitchen intrusion. The slapstick comedy performed by Lunkhead's hired hand gave me one on the floor, but I'll admit I'm a sucker for antics. The story concerned a group of people in their 30s returning to a summer camp they attended 20 years earlier. It was a farewell week of camp, since the place would be closed permanently at the end of the season. As adults, the camp seemed different, and they felt different about this and about each other. I recommend this fun and moving film for everyone. <br /> <br />
