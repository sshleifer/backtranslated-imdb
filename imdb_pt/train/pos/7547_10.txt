Cat Soup at first seems to be a very random animated film. The best way I could explain is that it's quite acidic. Although it is not totally random. The story is about Nyatta, a young cat and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very sick and dies, however, Nyatta sees her soul being carried away by death and is able to recover half of it. The story is about his mission to bring Nyaako fully back to life. <br /> <br /> Although much of the content in this movie seems completely random, it is not. Most of it is symbolism for life, death, and rebirth. You can also see references from other short stories, such as Hansel and Gretal. Strangely fluffy short film has an interesting story with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.
