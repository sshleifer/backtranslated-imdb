It's cheesy, it's scary, it's disgusting, but that's what makes it so much fun. He overcame the main melodramatic moments that are simply laughable. This movie is great for making fun of. Rent it for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around three television presenters, for a time before cell phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can not get a room to spend the night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. He is scary in a kind of psychosis. And he offers to let them stay in your house. But he does not tell the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is as incredible as "The Unseen," that he really carries this film. Most of the film is a bit boring, though it does find the truth of Ernest's family interesting. <br /> <br /> Just seeing this cast in these scenes is worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make a nice smile for the eyes. <br /> <br /> I consider the film an old jewel, difficult to find and worth checking out.
