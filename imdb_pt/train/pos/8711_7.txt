It is beyond my comprehension that so much garbage from Norway has been remastered for the DVD release, and yet gems like this do not stand a chance to recapture their past glory. I give a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few science fiction films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing less than a historical jewel of cinema that in many ways prefigures the first film Alien. And, my word, Blindpassasjer was the first! Did Ridley Scott or anyone on the team see the miniseries? However, unlikely, remains the fact that the scenes are extremely similar. Okay, the budget is much lower in the Norwegian film, but given that, it's a very good job since the bleak time of Norwegian cinema, which lasted until the 1990s.
