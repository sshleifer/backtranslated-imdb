If there were two more charming artists than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith appearing together in a more charming film in 1968, I do not know who they were. I first saw this tiny, delicious satirical gem twenty-five years ago at the age of sixteen, and I think of any year when you could not sit down to see it again wasted. He is intelligent, peculiar, pure, melancholy, sweet, kindly subversive, and absolutely charming. The romance of these two social misfits is richly comic and terribly touching - never more so than Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to bring the right card into the pack, a scene that is very funny and a perfect miniature portrait of moving loneliness. And that last freeze on Ustinov's anxious, worried and loving face when he asks, "Are you okay?" "Has anyone made the appearance and sound of devotion so perfectly and completely honest?" I would never want to meet someone who did not love this movie.
