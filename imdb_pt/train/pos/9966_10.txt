I saw this movie when the Mystery Science Theater published in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. So bad in fact, that out of sheer freakiness, this movie should get a rating of ten because it has to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Who wrote this script with the children in mind should be beaten. I mean, really, the devil against Santa? Visions of hell? Creepy laughing rebirth? Child Labor Forced with racial stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, that's right. As Crow exclaims during the MST3K showing, "This is a good old nightmarish fuel!" <br /> <br /> There are many strange insinuations and spoiled theology. Merlin (presumably the Arturian Merlin) goes out with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie the sky). Santa Claus talks about baby Jesus and sends "Mr. Stork" letters to children who ask for siblings. There are symbols around the castle that look like staves or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have watched every year since 1993 and submitted anyone to whom we can wait for 2 hours to watch it with us.
