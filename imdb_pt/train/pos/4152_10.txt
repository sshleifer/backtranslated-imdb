I've watched a few Cold Case episodes over the years, starting with episodes from the first season in 2003-2004. And while most have been good, this particular episode was not just the best of the best, but has few Emmy rivals. Although some may disagree with the content of the story (that is, the romantic relationship between men), I doubt anyone can watch it without being deeply moved within their spirit. <br /> <br /> The story is essentially about a case that was reopened, based on the testimony of a dying drug dealer. The two central actors are two cops in the 1960s, called Sean Coop (also known as Cold Case, who takes his surname, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In history, Coop is single, a veteran of the Vietnam War, with a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married with no children. Both are partners of the police force and form not only a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that both must hide from a deep and obviously homophobic culture prevalent at the time. <br /> <br /> The flashback scenes of their lives are mostly in black and white, with chunks of color now and then sprinkled everywhere. Examples include his red patrol car, the yellow curtains blowing softly through the window of Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drink, fight and kiss while they were in an alcohol-inducing state. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I have not yet figured out the color scheme and logic. The clearly homophobic tension between fellow patrollers and the two central actors only increases the intensity of the episode. One of the main emotional scenes was when Coop was confronted by his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected colleague in the force, confronts Coop about the rumors about Coop's relationship with Jimmy. You may feel sorry for Coop at this point when the shame and disgrace of Coop's father have piled upon Coop- "You will not disgrace our family ... and you are not my son either." - clearly indicative of the hostile views of same-sex relations of that time. An additional tension can also be seen in the police locker room where Coop and another cop do it after Coop and Jimmy are labeled "Batman and Robin Homos." As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it's obvious Coop wanted more from Jimmy in his life. Once you can see the tension in Jimmy's face as he must choose between his commitment to his wife and children, his church and even his immortal devotion to Coop. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy turns away from Coop, realizing that he can not have both Coop and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop is dead, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed by his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that hit the highest in the force. The most moving scene in the entire episode was when Coop, as he sat dying from gunshot wounds on his squadron, silently spoke his last words about police radio to his partner: "Jimmy. .. we were the lucky ones.Don't forget that. "<br /> <br /> The selection of the soundtrack was excellent during the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with actor Chad Everett, playing the still sad Jimmy, just much older now, and clearly still missing his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode and consider it the best. It is undoubtedly the most well written, well represented and well done of all the Cold Case episodes I have ever seen.
