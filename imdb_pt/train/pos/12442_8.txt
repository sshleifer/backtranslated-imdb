Filmed on an impossible schedule and with no budget to speak of, the film got much better than you'd expect, certainly far more faithful to the books and comics of Peter O'Donnell than the previous two films. You can read the track currently on reprints from Titan Books, or on Revue Comics monthly. It's one of the greatest adventure comics of all time. The film is not great, but unlike most low budget films, it takes full advantage of what it has, and keeps its interest. In the DVD extras, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, who is obviously stoned, is a gas. Some people blame Tarentino for associating his name with the film, but without it it would never have been made. He is a fan of Modesty Blaise and has chosen a good writer and director. All things considered, worth 8 stars.
