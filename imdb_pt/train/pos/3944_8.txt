This little movie was on my list of "guardians." Do people perceive how stressed out, menopausal women, emotionally abused (as well as mentally retarded) were actually treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century ?? All the pious and Christian attitudes of that time were mortal to explore TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he recognized women as having emotional feelings and responses as big as men? Think about it! The sensitivity of this film still catches me and I credit the director for capturing it through his eyes.
