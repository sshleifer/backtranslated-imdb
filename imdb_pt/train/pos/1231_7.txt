I like the battle of good and evil. I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done. He was not the smart one, arrogant, he knows everything he usually plays. It shows heart and a humbler mood. The fact of showing that there are stranger things in heaven and earth that we can think of gives me hope.
