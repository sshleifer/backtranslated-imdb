"Girlfight" is much more of a maturing story than a fighting movie. And what a relief to have in an urban school, with naturalist and lifelike Latinos and believable use of the Brooklyn project settings. <br /> <br /> It made me realize that virtually every Hollywood movie is set in luxurious suburbs or small towns. (Even the somewhat comparable "Love and Basketball," which focused on adolescent African Americans, was established in the suburbs.) While these children share some of the same problems, these issues diminish compared to the other struggles of these children, where they formed in the high school. could be the greatest achievement of their lives. <br /> <br /> The feminist element here is fascinating in its originality as you hold your breath to see if it can have a relationship - and a victory - on your terms. . A lot of public sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to come up with a situation of expectation of gender bending. <br /> <br /> The movie drags a little here and there, but this is not cheap emotion "Rocky" fight the movie, how practices and struggles have complex results, and all relationships - especially with parents and figures paternas - occupy the center of the stage more than the central ring. <br /> <br /> There were many interesting musical credits listed at the end, but I had not noticed the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 10/7/2000)
