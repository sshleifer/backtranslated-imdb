This movie did not really surprise me as such, it got better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well ... let's see how he does ..." Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. I appreciate Columbus. Even though I've never been a big fan of the show, I've always enjoyed watching Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played so well that I practically felt dizzy with pleasure! ... And I had not even drunk! <br /> <br /> This movie was so well done that I wanted to talk right on the phone with Paul and let him know how much I enjoyed it! but I could not find your number. It should be unlisted or something. <br /> <br /> This was one of those movies that I had no idea about what it would be or who was in it or something. He just came in and I thought, "Hey, why not? Let's see.If I do not like it - I do not have to watch ..." ... and I ended up loving it!
