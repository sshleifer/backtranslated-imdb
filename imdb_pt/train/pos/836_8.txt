This will probably not be voted as the best comedy of the year, some too many overlaps and plot holes. However, we are talking about a movie in which a gunslinger and a white bread seller become friends, so some whimsy should not be a big surprise. Brosnan excels in this role, and the role of James Bond (a paper on which he was wasted) was the wooden paper. If he can keep that kind of quality, I hope he keeps doing comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as the straight man of Brosnan. I read some negative comments here about Hope Davis, but I thought she was very good as a housewife with a dark side buried in the background. There are many good laughs as Brosnan slides and some scenes in which I almost died of laughter. My father (consultant) almost lost when Julian describes himself as a "facilitator." Like "Grosse Pointe Blank," another hit comedy, humor can be very somber. If you are in you be prepared to have fun.
