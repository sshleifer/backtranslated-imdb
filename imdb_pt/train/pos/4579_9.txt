I think this movie was reasonably good. It's kind of weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and everything. I really enjoyed it when they were small children in Full House. Anyway, the cast was good and the movie was a bit funny. I kind of mixed up between all the places of exchange and their names. It's just an older version of It Takes Two.
