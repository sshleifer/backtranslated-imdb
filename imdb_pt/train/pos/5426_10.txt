It's about the time that Gunga Din is released on DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I watched this great movie, but I never get tired of it. The leading actors worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt. Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I can not get over their exploits in India. Your first glimpse of Sergeants Three is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers on a so-called Treasure Map. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line and they enter a nearly deserted town - or so they think. <br /> <br /> They make the necessary repairs and soon find some "locals" in hiding. Soon after they are attacked by a group of madmen and can barely escape back to the base. <br /> <br /> Later, they are sent to another mission that gives the Sgt Cutter a chance to hunt gold with Din. They find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil supporters of Kali. Din is sent to get help and Cutter is caught. Soon McChesney and Ballentine arrive with Din, and they are very captured. Faced with death, they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them. The evildoers watch and are about to attack when a wounded Din climbs into the gilded dome and blows his horn that then alerts the British to the ambush. In doing so, Din is shot dead. <br /> <br /> The soldiers attack the evil ones and soon they defeat them. In the end, Din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the British Army.
