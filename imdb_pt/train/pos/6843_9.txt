Screenwriter and director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films that have been called, in a somewhat unfair fashion, "Hitchcock imitations." Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not steal Hitchcock; he lends elements of history or character that may have been seen in a Hitchcock movie and then expands them in a more violent and modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing death-drenched blood with macabre humor. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill," made in 1980, is perhaps De Palma's best-known Hitchcockian film. and is probably his best too. The story involves a serial killer transvestite pursuing both a burnt-out housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street hooker (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, this will remind you distinctly. of "Psycho", but De Palma's film is technically so ingenious and darkly creative. The sequence of the museum is particularly well marked and edited; the stabbing scene in the elevator is also one of the most unique murders ever made in movies. "Dressed to Kill" may not be a complete original, but I'd say it's definitely worth your time. A. Rated 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
