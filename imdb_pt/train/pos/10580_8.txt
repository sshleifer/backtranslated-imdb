This fabulous movie should be seen knowing millions put together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy economic conditions of everyday life during the 1930's. Remember, 10 cents bought a piece of bread at that time, so this was a smaller luxury for many people. It's a testament to how Hollywood did its best to make the US feel better about itself. You'll notice that with the studio system in Hollywood at the time, many of the actors and actresses were filmed in similar films, for example James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee. So too, branches of the US military have always been respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer, Busby Berkeley, in the end.
