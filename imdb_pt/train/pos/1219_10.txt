The second Care Bears movie is vastly better than its predecessor. It has a deeper storyline, better character development, and the songs (especially the closing song) are both captivating and warm. Of course the film tends to stress the affection, but come on, it's a movie of the Sweethearts. This film is a great photo to show children because it emphasizes friendship, love and, again, care. Not to mention that Affectionate Bears are very adorable!
