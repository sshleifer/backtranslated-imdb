I thought this movie was beautifully plotted which made me confused and my cousin who watched with me. To tell you the truth I think the young kevin dillon was hot. Hahahaha ... but I also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and what was wrong what he said to her before her death "I was inside you". I think that's what she can do what she did to him and how he's going to say she's very young when he never cared. How old are the other girls? Now I do not think I could trust a cop like that. But to tell the truth, it was pretty obvious that it was him, even if he wanted to become a police officer, I would still be suspicious. him anyway. And that was funny when she sprayed him in the store's eyes. Ahhahahaha. She was still stupid to get into the warehouse again alone, just like the cop who died HELLO! It's called back-up. Sometimes these movies make me angry when people act stupidly and do stupid things. But that's what I think about the movie.
