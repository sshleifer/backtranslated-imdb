An excellent film and a great example of how a movie can be scary without actually showing anything to the viewer. It's a set of four stories all spinning around the tenants of a charming old-fashioned house and its various horrible and terrible destinations all linked by an engaging story about an inspector from Scotland Yard in search of a missing horror movie star. It begins with a story about a mysterious writer whose main character becomes too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessed with a wax figure in a museum, then a story about a sweetly angelic little child. anything, but, and closing with the story of what happened to the missing movie star and what he does to the inspector. It's a lovely stamp that lets you really enjoy Director Duffell's work and what he has achieved on a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you have a movie that can be enjoyed over and over again. Just do not pick up the phone if someone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain at a nice house in the hinterland of England?
