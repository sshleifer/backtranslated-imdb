The first of Tarzan's films, staring Johnny Weissmuller. The plot has already been summarized so I will not go in again. All I know is that the actors who play Jane and Tarzan were born for the role. If you have not seen this movie yet and you only have the modern Tarzan movies as a reference ... you are missing out on a real treat. No matter how far we have come in film production, makeup sets projects ... no one will ever play Tarzan, just like Johnny Weissmuller. He was and is Tarzan.
