Good murder sequel in a small town. In this, Cash and his police colleague, the lieutenant, unroll a sticky plot involving a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch and a family of crooks and their wierdo helpers. As in the original, the viewer is treated with a little mystery with distinct visions and sounds of prewar America. Go see that.
