Three girls (no less than one woman, including cult actress Barbara Bach) visiting a small town to cover a festival, end up renting rooms in a house they should have avoided like the plague. Well done little shocking, suffering a bit with some redundant dialog scenes and a very fine plot (which does not do well at hiding their secrets). One underlying theme in particular is quite disturbing (as in: vintage shock material), and that's basically what the movie thrives on. Performances and cinematography are well above normal (compared to many other films of the late 70s and early 80s on the same line), but what really makes me recommend this movie is the fairly long climatic scene in the basement scenario. From the moment the character "Keller Junior" was introduced, his performance left my chin open and did not close until the end of the film. A very pleasant surprise to see actor Sydney Lassick (who was funny in the movie "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's", and now totally insane in "The Unseen") took one of the main roles.
