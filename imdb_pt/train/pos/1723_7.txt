Excellent P.O.W. adventure, adapted by Eric Williams from his own book (a paperback copy of which is part of my father's library) that was inspired by true events; may be the first film of its kind and therefore has a lot to answer for ?? not only similar examples of rigid upper lips like ALBERT, RN (1953; I will watch at the moment), THE COLDITZ STORY (1955) and DANGER WITHIN (1959), but more striking releases from the other side of the Atlantic, namely STALAG 17 (1953) and THE GREAT ESCAPE (1963). This then sets the basis quite solidly: British soldiers interned in a German camp inventing an ingenious escape plan by lending a page of Greek legend? digging under a jumping horse used during physical exercise and in the sight of his captors! In fact, the film is divided into two halves: the first deals with the slow process of tunneling, culminating in the escape itself, while the later stages show their fortunes off the field as they try to reach neutral Sweden. (Anthony Allen) and promising stars (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers), not to mention countless trusted actors (Anthony Dawson, Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell). The three leaders / fugitives are Genn, Steel and Tomlinson: while the first two are together, the last one goes its own way ?? only to run to others as they reach safety. As might be expected, the narrative involves much suspense and enthusiasm; as with most P.O.W. sagas, too, the female interest is kept to a minimum. Director Lee has not had a long career? with that and a bit similar (albeit with a change of setting and point of view) a city like ALICE (1956) its most remarkable achievements ?? but he certainly has milked each exciting situation in this case (even if, presumably, delays in filming have made Lee prematurely leave his post) leaving producer Ian Dalrymple with the task of tying loose ends! In any case, it is worth mentioning the exquisite lighting (especially during the nightly sequences).
