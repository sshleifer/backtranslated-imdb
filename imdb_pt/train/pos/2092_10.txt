I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer deserved his Oscar. I left the movie thinking yes! Having seen Muni in only one film in which he was somewhat retarded, I expected the same kind of performance here. I was happily proven wrong. While some might criticize him for being too childish and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of ​​Asians, I thought he was right on paper. Keye Luke, if he had had the chance to play a leading role, could have interpreted it the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed with the camera work and the use of crowds scenes, especially during the sacking of the palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and sombre atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made it an epic quite different from the others of the same era in which everything was bright and shining. I watched this movie from beginning to end captivated. I can not say the same for the "epics" of today.
