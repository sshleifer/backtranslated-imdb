Yes, as the other reviewers have already stated, this may not be vintage L & H but it is far from its worst job as in the 20th century Stupid ... I mean Fox. This film certainly has all the basic ingredients for things to give wrong for boys. But it's their serious approach and determination that makes them funny. They do not play to laugh, as other comedians do, but they take their work and their situation very seriously, and that is the essence of their eternal mood. In this movie, they are faced with some basic issues that can really be encountered by any of us today, namely work-related stress. First, we would be examined by a doctor and he would prescribe a much needed rest and perhaps stay by the sea. That is where surrealism comes to all this. L & H always takes a set of more plausible circumstances and exaggerates, but never to the point of being incredible, except perhaps from time to time. This makes us laugh, because we can relate to their own problems and attempts at extraction. That's what makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this movie, all of these ingredients are presented in a delightfully artistic and graceful way. Not the best of them compared to their previous work, probably because this was the last movie they did for Roach because he wanted to mirror the "big" studios and do things exclusively and also wanted to hurry up and end his contractual obligation. BIG MISTAKE! They should have stayed all together and continued for maybe another five years. What the world may have missed in not considering this as an option. Watch, laugh and enjoy this last great presentation.
