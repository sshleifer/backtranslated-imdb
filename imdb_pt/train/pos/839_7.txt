Think Pierce Brosnan and you find soft, elegant, intelligent James Bond. In this movie, Brosnan plays against the guy - and has a lot of fun doing it (as well as the audience). This is a movie about a hired killer who befriends a tormented businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with very good scenes (a fascinating Brosnan, on the edge and a good, compliant "off" -the-edge Kinnear has some good lines). My only objection is that Hope Davis, playing the tolerant wife ("Can I see your gun?") Does not show up more often: it could have been a wonderful foil for these men. <br /> /> This movie is like a killer: play with the public while "going to kill". The ending is incredible because a plot (with a positive moral!) Arises: this is a frantic, frenetic and entertaining movie that deserves a large audience.
