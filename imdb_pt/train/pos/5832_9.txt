Ever since I saw this movie as a child, over 30 years ago, I never tire of watching it. From the opening scenes at the horn factory to the car engine running from the back seat of the car to Ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by Stan, I think this might have been the best movie of the last few days. After that, they moved to 20th Century Fox, and while those films were not terrible, they did not have the comic timing of this movie. Jimmy Finnlayson, his long time, in his last appearance with the boys, appears as the Doctor is super! quote: "I said goat's milk" your response to Stan asking him how you milk a ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin appear! I would say it all in one of my favorite L & H comedies.
