"Fraidy Cat," the fourth of those drawings, is good. At least I like it, so I'm surprised this is getting mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This is more of a macabre story than funny, although it has its comedic moments. The atmosphere is dark and scary. Suspense is another strong element here. As for humor, it's mostly black humor. <br /> <br /> In this short, Tom hears a scary radio program at night and is absolutely terrified because it's about ghosts, something he believes. While Tom is scared to death, Jerry is watching everything and can not help but laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner, he creates a great "ghost." <br /> <br /> Tom lives the most frightening experience of his entire life. Although Jerry scares Tom without a good reason, the way the story is made ends up being funny. Also, again, there is no violence here, because this is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. However, I do not understand that the joke of Tom's 9 lives was almost sucked in by the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally discovers that it was all a Jerry scheme and that Jerry made a fool out of it, Jerry is "caught with his hand in the cookie jar" (he deserves to be discovered). However, Tom shows incredible patience before reacting. He glares at Jerry for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and it takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a different, quirky and striking experience of Tom and Jerry.
