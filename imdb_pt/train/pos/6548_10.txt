This is a great movie! I played all of Nancy Drew's games and read the books, and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (Secret of the Old Watch) so you can get used to Nancy, so you can watch the movie because in the movie, they do not really feature the characters. names fast. ;) My whole family liked it and the plot was extremely interesting. This is a last return of the previous films of Nancy Drew, that the actor of Nancy Drew did not seem to combine. This movie is very much like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy Drew lovers, you must watch this!
