The film had many core values ​​of family and love. It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. The script was clear (it was very easy to understand, perfect for kids) and at times it was enjoyable and fun. There were a few symbols loaded to search. Cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that many filmmakers have done today (which, quietly, frankly, is getting a little warned). It was clearly filmed, but had a smooth quality good for it. Although the editing could have been done better, I thought it was a good movie for a family to enjoy. And the information organization was thrown at you, which I also did not like, but overall it was a good movie.
