I agree with the previous comment by naming the content of the movie "everyday madness," but would like to specify that: "Dog Days" is about how women are treated in a (male) society. The episodes we see here show some variation in the daily discrimination of women, mainly categorized by age group. There is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had, treating her like a doll who must act "worthy to wear" the former's clothing. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is almost a slave and he a master (violent). In addition, we find a slightly younger man who does not communicate with his friend / wife and, instead of being really jealous about his affairs, even befriends his / her competitor (s). A young adult makes it clear to his friend - a girl who is really disturbed by being beautiful enough for him - that she has to be the jewel next to you and follow your strict label rules. Finally, there is a fifty-something man who calculates his own advantage and delivers a woman hitchhiker to a furious customer who - taking her guilty for scratching her car - naturally hits her. To complete the examples, we find the man's friend in the "master-slave" pair - after assaulting her collectively - threatening and humiliating the first "in his good", for she must get rid of her partner and consider her new " master". During all this, the inhabitants of the newly built neighborhood where the action happens rest under the hot summer sun - absolutely immobile (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portrait of the archaic structures still reigning in the relationship between women and men, but what I have seen convincingly analyzes the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool to teach even the least sensitive viewer what is wrong - due to good viewing.
