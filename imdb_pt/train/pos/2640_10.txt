Of course, many people have not seen this movie because no one is posting any more comments. This is not a movie to be wasted. After all, he won the George Peabody Award and the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield should have won a prize for his incredible performance in this film. Eugene Logan, who was a co-writer on this made for the TV movie was also part of another film about humanity, or his loss, for being a technical advisor to the Truman Capote movie House of Glass. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I'll post another letter telling how Eugene Logan became the technical advisor to a movie about a person as incredible as Truman Capote. Thanks for reading this and hope you find a way to see these two movies.
