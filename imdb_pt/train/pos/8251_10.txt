And that someone is me. And not just me, as I can see here in IMDb or when leaving the theater. Why do people love it? Obviously, everyone already knows zombies (at least Horror heart fans and others through the reinvention of "Dawn of the Dead" or Resident Evil movies etc.) <br /> <br /> Or at least they They thought they knew everything about zombies ... until the movie came along. And you'll see zombies in a new light (maybe). This is not a horror movie, although it contains some violent scenes, but a comedy. A satire to be precise. And that never comes out of the steam! That's why I rated it so high. Pacing wise is incredible, the acting is great and the script has no mistakes (obvious) ... quite the opposite: it's a gem and if you're just a little interested in zombies, you should see it! And even if you do not like them, watch! Because it's a great movie (comedy)!
