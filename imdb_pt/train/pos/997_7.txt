I have to agree with most of the other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? to me, leaned a little to the side of the comedy. I could have been a great movie without the comedy and it was terribly planned. Jamie keeps running for Julio and what's his name. In New York, how often do you meet someone you know in downtown Cleveland. And how did Robert Pastorelli dig the Yankee Stadium to hide the gold? Again, a comedy or drama? But it was still fun especially for a Sunday morning. I liked the performance of Kimberly Elise, she certainly a beautiful actress and seems to take her craft seriously. She is a younger actress who is going to be viable.
