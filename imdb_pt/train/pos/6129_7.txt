Notice I did not say it's better ... just nicer. The lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised that this was not a Troma movie, as it has all of Troma's trademarks, including vomiting acidic liquids, villain after every murder, a ridiculous rape scene in the tub it's kinda hard to get upset, since the rapist is a snowman), and stupid deputies. <br /> <br /> There is much to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, on whom it is observed that he has no legs or feet, drives a police car through the city. <br /> <br /> 2. Even though it is supposed to be near (or below) freezing, no one's breathing is shown and there are no signs of car exhaustion when the cars are running. <br /> <br /> 3. Snow reminds more of heap or peanut styrofoam than real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenager gets horny for her boyfriend just hours after her brother is terribly murdered. She tells him to invade the sheriff's house, everywhere, to get it. But first, she tells him that he has to build a good fire in the fireplace and open some wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After Jake's teenage head is cut by a sled runner, his father argues with the sheriff about whether Tommy, the sheriff's son, had anything to do with it. The sheriff says Tommy would not be fighting Jake because Jake "is at least six inches taller than Tommy." At that moment, someone in the background says, "No more!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to melt, the sheriff struggles with a flat snowman made of some type of fabric for a long period. This is far better than Tarzan struggling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators struggling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I would not have been able to keep a serious face right now. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun movie. There is not really much blood.
