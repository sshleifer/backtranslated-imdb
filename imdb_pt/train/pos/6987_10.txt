Putting the "thing" UFO aside. This was the best documentary I've ever seen. Neil and Buzz's factual reporting ... a must-see. The interviews and reports are a revelation since most of the information was confidential in 1969 and was only released in 2006. No documentary so far has details or accuracy for these brief 47 minutes ... FACTS will kill you, and you'll be amazed at the risks taken to be the first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest heroes of our time. Ever seen a man save his own life? Bet not. Neil saves his life when only millennia separate him from death. Incredible to watch. It's a farce people did not know all the details associated with landing on the Moon and the courage that these men had in the face of certain death, from a defective computer ... 10 stars!
