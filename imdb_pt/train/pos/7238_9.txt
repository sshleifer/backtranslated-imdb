SMALL SPOILERS WARNING !!! Good movie ... VERY good movie. And I'm surprised to say that because I'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of director Deran Serafian's name usually means bad news. Most of his films are below average action movies, like Death Warrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued to make horror movies instead of action. This movie really fascinated me. Good achievement, not seeing famous actors or big budget was involved. It's really the story that keeps you focused. Especially fans of the original myth of Dracula will be pleased. Sarafian ignites another aspect of Bram Stoker's famous story and remains quite loyal and true to the truth. He explains the life of Count Dracula of Roemen and how he frightened the Turkish army, stinging dead corpses in front of his castle. Of course, that's where reality and "true story-based" stop. The drinking blood and everything was invented by Bram Stoker. <br /> <br /> In this film, the count (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the US and seduces tons of women. And they're all pretty girls, I'll give it to him. Overall, good acting of unfamiliar faces, blood and blood enough to satisfy the most morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. This movie is really unknown and was hidden on the darkest shelf of my local video library. But it certainly pays to wipe the dust off the cover and put it on the VCR. Heck, it's a lot better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie with the same title. These two films have nothing in common, but I blame the film for stealing the attention of this beautiful photo. Check out ... my humble opinion on To Die For = 8.5 / 10
