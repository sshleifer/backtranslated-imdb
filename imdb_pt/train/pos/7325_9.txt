John Carpenter's Halloween is frankly a horror masterpiece. He tells the immortal story of mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to chase after and kill a group of nannies. <br /> <br /> This was the first and undoubtedly the best of the Halloween franchise. . Carpenter shows great restraint by walking slowly in history and building sympathetic characters; unusual for a horror photo. <br /> <br /> Even more unusual is the lack of blood and blood, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween to this day. Take it! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked the premiere of Jamie Lee Curtis's film and a defining point in the career of the late great Donald Pleasance. A real classic.
