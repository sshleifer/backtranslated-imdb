Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book-based film ever made. The film has the same feel as the comic book, staying true to the color scheme. The Batman series went up, fell, went up and fell again. Dick Tracy has the true staying power as something that adults and children can enjoy. Good men triumph over evil, without blood and blood to show the point. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of adapting himself from Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best work from afar is Warren Beatty, who just synthesizes Dick Tracy, just like he did with Clyde Barrows. I can not wait until it comes out on DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is running out.
