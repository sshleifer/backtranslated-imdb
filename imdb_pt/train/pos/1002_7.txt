Just two comments ... SEVEN YEARS AHEAD? Hard evidence of the film's relentless pulling force! As already mentioned, the GANTRY ROW low budget telemovias status is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. That being said, however, the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as a frightening outlet per se. <br /> <br /> It is true that the plot, at its most basic, is a rework of the HORROR AMYVILLE - only without much horror. Another intrigue! Gibney might have made a more valuable impression if he had interpreted Halifax - investigating some seemingly disconnected murders with the "house" as the prime suspect. The script is better than the average and the overall production is of a high standard. He simply fails to engage the viewer particularly in important moments. <br /> <br /> Having chosen the DVD for only $ 3.95 last week at my regular video store, I can not refuse the expense. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the movie. Just do not expect fireworks!
