Yes, Keaton seems to really enjoy making this movie. With a leap in his stride in his striped suits, he will remind you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young henchman who only does this to pay his mother's expensive medical bills and send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to law school. No one knows until Johnny Kelly is Johnny Dangerously until later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin & does not like Johnny at all (and I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a good singing / dancing routine while Johnny enjoys it. I love the part when they are in the ever-changing getaway car! The cop who's "calling all the cars" is the Skipper on Gilligan's Island! See this for 30's gangster gigs! The jokes in this movie are hilarious, but you have to get them or you'll miss them! Look at the bottom of each scene.
