Today, if someone mentions the name Victor McLaglen, the answer will probably be "Who?" or maybe "Why?" Well, believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won the Oscar for Best Actor in this movie, which is about a poor and desperate man who is willing to sell his best friend for "carfare" to the United States. It's an interesting movie that shows how low even the most well-intentioned shnooks go for just a few dollars. The film takes place in British-dominated Ireland and while all the other characters are fighting directly or indirectly for Ireland's political independence, all McLaglen's character is worried about is getting money and getting drunk. The film makes one wonder if political activism is worth all the work, because while the activist is struggling to make a point, many others not only do not care, they do not even know what the fuss is. The moral of this film is: look at the friend, he can sell you for a penny.
