Lion King 1 1/2 is a very fun and addictive sequel. Do not expect production figures from a theatrical release, but expect the highest quality direct-to-video release. <br /> <br /> It is created as Timon & Pumba start watching the original Lion King in a dark theater and abruptly change track and begin to narrate his own story. This is done with frequent interruptions of comedy. For example, during a tense moment in particular, a home shopping commercial appears and a poor Pumbaa realizes that he is sitting on the remote. These little moments spice up the movie, and whether you find them fun or not will depend a lot on your sense of humor. If you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer that you are watching a movie, then this may not be your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The animation is the best they have invested in the Disney DTV line, and is integrated almost perfectly with the original material. The new, more independent material uses the artistic style of the original. The talents of voice are all well executed, although I could not help thinking of Marge Simpson every time I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many of the film's jokes will be well-regarded by viewers as recycled on film. generations, but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than irritatingly repetitive. <br /> <br /> The music made me realize how much I liked and missed a good musical integrated with a Disney feature. The opening feature of 'Dig A Tunnel' is well choreographed and hilarious. Timon and Pumbaa take on the opening sequence of the Lion King and their introduction to paradise is also fun. The only problem was the replay of 'Dig A Tunnel' at the end of the movie, changing its lyrics and melodies from defeatist to uplifting. <br /> <br /> The plot is very well done, and the integration of new plot elements are done almost perfectly, although the final bit during the persecuted hyena stretches the credibility of the plot a bit. The new story does not seem to deal well with saccharine or emotionally charged moments, and improves when it comes to full comedy. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's worth buying. If you like all the bonus features that come with a typical set of 2 discs, then go ahead. For the penny who is still willing to invest in a good movie, wait until he drops four or more dollars and rents it right away. <br /> Damion Crowley.
