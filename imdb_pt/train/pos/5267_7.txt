Apparently, Ruggero Deodato discovered at first that his story would not work if he approached very seriously, so he decided to camp. The result is a movie that can be seen as a ridiculous epic of sword and witchcraft or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'll go on Monday. The brief bloody moments are well-done, the Paul Brothers openly mock the material (they even bark at each other in a scene!), And there's also a charming, witty and humorous presentation by Eva La Rue as the girl . who marks along with the "boys". Also, where else can you see the interior of a dragon lit up like a disco? (***)
