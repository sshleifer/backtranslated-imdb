The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the world of culture will notice. The director puts us in check with the story of Alexander, a chaplinesco study distracted from the addiction in chess. Nastasya is on vacation in a resort of marble columns, where a chess tournament is being hosted. She meets Alexander, picking up a piece of queen that he drops in the pocket of his coat. A magnetic attraction evolves by which he proposes the next day, the mother alarmed the telegrams of the husband. He arrives and questions Alexander, we have these deviations to the past, ala 'Padrinho II, where we see young Alexander, a child prodigy. He is taken under a wing of school teachers and explores his genius for 10 years making large sums. Thinking Alexander has reached its peak, it abandons it, but becomes legend. The old teacher returns doing damage, trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander. In a serious chess game, where the victory of the World Chess Champion is a path to immortality, the chess clock fires, the game time ends to finish the next day. That day is the marriage of Nastasya, the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent in a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding his belly and looking through the coat of his love, finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. Although the film sadly balances from its Russian roots, its low-cut dresses are adorable, Alexander plays his role sublimely. The director underestimated his audience, we almost never touched and the only tip of The Luzhin Defense is after trading queens, isolating the king's opponents with his 3 legs and king, sacrificing the castle for a companion. Nastassia is a great game, but I think its conclusion deserved more intensity, but perhaps the emotions were right in the chess, which meant more to him than to her. Lujin's defense elegantly honors Navokov, the complexity of his work on images is a world event not to be missed.
