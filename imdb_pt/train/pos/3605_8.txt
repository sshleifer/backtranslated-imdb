girlfight is using a formula known as someone pointed, however, I have seen many movies that do not do this so well or are not credible. I think, in the end, it's easier for a woman to empathize with the character and feel more touched by the film. <br /> <br /> The film is encouraging mentally and physically, even if your life and your environment are completely different. and, I think the viewer can still earn a lot by seeing this. although it took 5 years to start practicing boxing and sports in general, this is the movie that gave me the spark. <br /> <br /> So the plot is familiar / ordinary. the actors are good. but the thoughts that can trigger it are what make it above average in my opinion. This made a big impression on me and I know I'm not the only one.
