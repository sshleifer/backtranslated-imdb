I really thought this movie was great. Not only is the story correct, but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate. I was a fan of Victoria's portrait of Emily Blunt and how she kept her spirit, despite being forced into virtual exile while she was young. Blunt portrays the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic way that Vicotria became famous (perhaps infamous) for. The romantic elements of the film are so genuine and tender that at the end of the movie you really understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of his days in mourning for Albert. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are noteworthy as well. I appreciated the beautiful score, which moves wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story. I also considered cinematography excellent, some scenes taking my breath away because of the exuberance and splendor they represent. <br /> <br /> There have been so few movies this year as beautiful and soft as this movie and it sorts. as one of the best of 2009!
