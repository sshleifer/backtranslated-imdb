Fans of the HBO series "Tales From the Crypt" will love this episode of MOH. Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the EC's classic comics are based on will recognize you right away. <br /> <br /> Favorite indie despised Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the scripts for ZERO APARTMENT and DEATH BE BECOMES HER) is the kind of guy whose ordinary man looks can go either way. He could play a really cool guy if he's misunderstood, or he can play the same part with a scary tone of corrosive lassitude. In the RIGHT OF DIE case, it takes the latter approach, and it definitely works. <br /> <br /> Donovan is a doctor who recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (Robin Sydney), much to the dismay of his inconsolable and relentless wife, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two get into a terrible car crash as they return from an unsuccessful "make-up" weekend, and she's horribly burned in a fire, he's reluctant to pull her plug, not without some enthusiastic nudges from her even more scandalous lawyer and best friend (Corbin Bernsen, looking worse than ever). <br /> <br /> But Abbey never gave up without a fight, and that's where the EC theme comes in. Betrayed husbands - and wives - have always been the favorite subject of the genre for some frightening supernatural antics (and OOKY), and this case is definitely no exception. If anything, the sex and gore quotient should have Bill Gaines giggling with joy in his mausoleum somewhere. <br /> <br /> And not to mention that John Esposito's original script gives the angle of adultery only a slight twist. You do not realize, as you watch, that you only know half of the story, until the end ... (think WHAT BENEUTA DOES with more courage and gazongas, and you're there.) <br /> <br /> It's not a bad effort, but also not the best. At least Rob Schmidt shows a touch of talent here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messages a truly awful experience! As with most MOH episodes, this is following a prevailing topic in this time of exfoliation and breakup, so it is not necessary to apply a great deal of hiccups.
