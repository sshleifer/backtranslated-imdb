This documentary aired on TEN and the BBC in recent months. Having seen this twice now, I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in media and documentary production. <br /> <br /> Initially, this documentary was made to detail the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew unleashed these intentions. What happens when they arrive in Venezuela is surprising when they witness firsthand the attempt by Chavez and his government to overthrow the rebel factions (particularly concerns about Venezuela's oil). What we witness is how the media manipulates the situation and in fact supports the overthrow of Ch√°vez, distorting the events that take place as the coup increases. <br /> <br /> It's really an excellent documentary and a remarkable work of art. work by a couple of new filmmakers. <br /> <br />
