Meryl Streep excels in her subtle and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain who was charged and tried for allegedly killing her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and using her vicious dingos alibi as her defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and titled so in its Australian release, A Cry in the Dark is an ugly movie to watch. It presents a scenario that is very real for us in America: the witch hunt against a person considered an easy target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who said what she thought, someone who did not play the card of sympathy, and someone who was hard enough to move on with her life despite her terrible ordeal, she was labeled suspicious and hated beyond understanding even when she was Of course he did not kill his own son. The media began a tight knot and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon let the whole nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated the family piece by piece. And for all that, Lindy remained as impassive as ever, even when her husband Michael was crumbling. <br /> <br /> This stance, of course, is the power of force, however unpleasant it may seem, and people react strongly to it. They want to see an afflicted mother cry and cry and occasionally faint at every corner, not sit and look blank. People do not understand that not everyone suffers the same way and when someone decides to stay strong they start speculation. Meryl Streep incarnates this tainted woman to the fullest, and in so doing, creates a cold, but not insensitive, woman who holds her convictions, even if they cost her freedom. Because of it, Sam Neill may have his character slowly dissolving into despair - someone needs it, or the Chamberlains would be very detached, and no one wants to see it. Except for the monster that at the time this text was written became the news. They always eat traces of the train and feed the mutilated manure to the uninformed public.
