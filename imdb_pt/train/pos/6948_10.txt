The first time I saw this episode was like a shock to me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". The speed that things are happening is incredible, and it's so amazing, exciting and even interesting, it's almost as if you were reading a book; once you start, it is very difficult to stop. From the minute Richard Walsh was talking privately with Jack about the possibility that they had a mole inside the CTU, I was seated at 6:40 p.m., which means 10 episodes !!! (Sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the kind of guy that when he's interested, he just can not stop) This series is one of the best of a kind. And it's built in order to have some different stories that are being connected together. Recommended in every way!
