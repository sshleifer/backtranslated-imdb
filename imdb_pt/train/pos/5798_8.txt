I saw this for the first time when they showed it at the time of Easter 1993/4 and did not think much of it, so I bought it on DVD last summer when I started to get interested in Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and I enjoyed it more now I'm older. It's a good movie, but it will not be this classic movie like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard of Oz, etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members. There were disturbing scenes like the girl Katie being hit by gangster Frankie Lideo, played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turns into a robot. My favorite song in the movie was Smooth Criminal. I think it was better than Thriller, in my opinion.
