The Tattooed Stranger was another of those rare B movies that BBC2 did in Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also "Live By Night" and "The Brighton Strangler". In this, a man walking his dog in Central Park is confronted with an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside. She was shot and police tried to identify her with only a tattoo as the main clue. After being identified, the killer is discovered and is shot in the shooting at the end. <br /> <br /> Most of this movie was filmed in New York and surrounding areas, so we can see some areas of the city. we usually do not see, especially the back streets. <br /> <br /> Almost all the strangers are in the cast, with John Miles coming to the top. <br /> <br /> The Stranger Tattooed is worth looking for. Excellent, but rather obscure. Rating: 3 out of 5
