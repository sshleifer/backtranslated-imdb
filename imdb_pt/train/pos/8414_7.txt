'The Student of Prague' is an early horror drama or, on the contrary, it is an 'authorenfilm' (ie an author film). This film is a member of a movement of many movements that try to give respectability to the cinema or just to profit, adapting the literature or the theater on the screen. Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe, it focuses on the doppelg√§nger theme. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the most cinematic film is the double exposure effect to make Paul Wegener appear twice in the scenes. Guido Seeber was a special effects magician for his day, but he is not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. Film student Leon Hunt, however, made an interesting analysis of this film using the framework to amplify the theme of the duo: characters being divided by left / right, next / distant and front framing / diagonal characters and shots. Regardless, the film mainly consists of long strokes extended from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the lack of editing; there is very little dissection of scenes and scenes endure. None of this is unusual for 1913, but there were more advanced films about it at the same time, including the best parts of "Atlantis" (August Blom, 1913), "Twilight of the Soul of a Woman" (Yevgeni Bauer, 1913). and the short films by DW Griffith. <br /> <br /> A universal film vocabulary expanded in 1926 would allow for an immensely superior remake. In addition, the remake has a reason for the character Lyduschka, in addition to being an occasional troublemaker and substitute for the viewer. Here, the gypsy intrinsically represented lurks, apparently, with a cloak of invisibility. I know their world is silent to me, but I suppose, with their moving lips and such, that their world would not be silent to them, so how can Lyduschka look upon the shoulders of others and not be noticed? <br /> <br /> However, this is one of the first most interesting films conceptually. Wegener, who seems to have been the main subject behind this film, as well as playing the lead role, would later play the title role and co-directed "The Golem" in 1920 - helping to further unlock the supernatural thread in silent movies German <br /> <br /> (Note: The first version I saw was about an hour long (certainly not completely complete) and was in bad shape, with the faces sometimes bleached and such. sure of who was the I have also seen the Alpha DVD, which, at 41 minutes, is missing images present in the above mentioned printing and also has less and very different title cards, but visually not so bad.The repetitive punctuation is better muted, despite.)
