Nowadays, "The Color Purple" by Spielberg is remembered mainly for being nominated for eleven Oscars and for winning zilch. What's even more alarming is that Spielberg himself was not even nominated for Best Director. Needless to say, filmmakers deserved more acclaim than they were awarded. <br /> <br /> The story is about the trials and tribulations of Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), an African-American woman dominated at first by her incestuous father and then by her abusive husband. The film spans several years and focuses mainly on Celie's relationships with the women around her. It's told from a decidedly feminine perspective, but you need not fear it's a chick flick. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, lively with humor at times, although the central character's struggles are paramount. Some may not appreciate the change of tone from the end of the movie, but I did not care, although similar content in a smaller movie would probably have rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> The film received three Oscar nominations for acting. : Whoopi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avery (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly deserving and Danny Glover was inexplicably stiff. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Spielberg did not receive a nomination for Best Director for his efforts. Such omission invades belief, since Spielberg's direction here is first-rate. I'm not especially crazy about Quincy Jones's score, but it's not below average anyway. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is satisfying, well told by a master filmmaker working from Pulitzer. Award winning material. Try it and you'll probably be as confused as I am about how he could be treated badly on Oscar night.
