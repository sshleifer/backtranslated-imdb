Since the average vote rate was too low, and the fact that the store employee thought it was "okay," I did not have much of an expectation when renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But unlike the above, I liked it a lot. This is a lovely movie. No need to grow in me, I liked it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the main character, I think a little different from his usual personality in his films. <br /> <br /> There are not many knockout jokes or something, but there are some rather hilarious scenes. and overall it's a very nice movie and very easy to see. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
