This movie resonated with me on two levels. As a child, I was evacuated from London and planted unwilling hosts in a rural village. While I escaped the bombing and had experiences that produced precious memories (for example, hearing a nightingale singing a dark night for the first time) and enjoying a life I could never have had in London, I missed my family and cared about them . Tom is an elderly man whose wife and son died and lives alone in a small rural village. Like an old man now without a wife whose children are married and live far away in another province, I am alone again. The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very strange ideas of raising a child. Since a deep affection has grown between old Tom Oakley and this young boy, Tom goes after him and finally rescues him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story, there is a great deal of tension, since, due to some bureaucratic decision, it seems that the child will lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
