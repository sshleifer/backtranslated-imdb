AG was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and suspense that is so rare for American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many spectators the willies. We rooted Caleb as he struggled to resist the openings of Sheriff Lucas. We became absorbed and afraid to learn of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that the weekly was afraid of doing what Lucas would do next were truly astounding. This show lived up to the "gothic" nickname in ways that American entertainment has rarely tried, let alone mastered. The costumes definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts shame on the current excess of "reality" shows, which are so less than satisfying the viewing. The call to a DVD box set is well based. This show is a quality vision for a demanding market hungry quality of viewing. An audience that gets tired of over-saturation of the numbing reality of the mind will welcome this jewel of real storytelling. Bring the DVD box !!
