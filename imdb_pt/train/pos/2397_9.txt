Having seen and loved the latest film by Greg Lombardo, "Knots" (he co-wrote and directed that film as well), I decided to check out his previous work, and this movie was well worth the effort and rent. Macbeth in Manhattan is a tongue in cheek, excellent take on Shakespeare's favorite, updated and moved to NYC. I was struck by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was impressed by how the production plot in the film mirrors the plot of the play itself - and very cleverly for it. The trials and tribulations of life in Manhattan are parallel to many Shakespeare plays, and Central Park was rarely better used than the forest around Macbeth's castle. Mr. Lombardo obviously has a special place in his heart for the stories of New York and New York (Knots is a fun and sensational sex comedy about six and thirty years old that New Yorkers are in a charming Brooklyn neighborhood , with offices in Manhattan and a loft in the center for good measure) and spent considerable time around Shakespeare's plays. The film is very rhythmic and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of Macbeth. It reminded me of Al Pacino's "Looking for Richard," another wonderful "Shakespeare play in a movie." I recommend checking out Macbeth in Manhattan.
