Here's a fun fact, I was the baby in the movie, the one in the crib. :) I'm 19 now. my parents took me to try the paper, we lived in Texas at the time. I think I only won $ 80 for it, but I did not stay long. My parents said I would cry when I should be happy and I would be happy when I should cry. I was all confused. Strange and funny stuff, I suppose .. and no, I'm not a child actress. I'm living in San Antonio, working in a walgreens. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived in Maryland most of my life. This movie is a great movie, good concept. I've seen it several times in my short 19 years.
