Tressa's vocal performance was excellent !! Tressa played the role of singer while Richard was at the club. When she left the stage and began to riff and strut her things, it made my soul tremble. Your voice is platinum. She needs to make a CD. She has more fans, so she realizes. I loved her show stopping the performance in the five beats of the heart, that she also starred with Leon when he was younger. How can a little girl have such a big voice? She is truly incredible.good good voice good good good voice voice voice great voice fantastic, back trembling, tears crying, uplifting, take you back in the days voice. Tressa, if you read this pledge, please take my advice and start burning a CD. If not just for the sake of singing, but for your fans. I believe you can really do that. Look at these other studio singers, lol.
