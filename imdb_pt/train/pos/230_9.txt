When I first saw this movie on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film shows an accurate picture of the South and racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses condoms for work. Soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights into the way the south was at that time. I suppose if Soll were to live today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitudes toward a little boy who comes to work for him and the condemned are complex. While he has racist opinions, he has grown to trust some of those convicted who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the film, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in great performances as well as Hass. <br /> <br /> This movie should have gained more notoriety. However it is on DVD and worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
