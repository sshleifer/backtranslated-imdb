This movie has a cast of stars, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi, to name a few, race in Monte Carlo as well as some other beautiful European locations, and it's very funny. The problem everyone gets when they lie to protect themselves is great, and I recommend you watch this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is at his best in Once Upon A Crime, just like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Everybody gives stellar performances, great acting, great comedy and great timing, which is rare in movies these days. Great plot, great mystery, (which I love anyway) and in general, well worth the money you spend on it. So grab the kids, grab some popcorn, juice, tea or soda, and enjoy the show !!!!
