And I absolutely adore Isabelle Blais !!! She was so cute in this movie, and very different from her role in "Quebec-Montreal," where she was more like a man-eater. I think she should have been nominated for a Jutra. I mean, Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was far superior, IMO. Pelletier did a great job on his first time, and I noticed he sneaked in with some of his fellow Rock and Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was fun to see them in this, I did not know they would show up. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've seen a romantic comedy from Quebec that I did not like, and this is as good as any I've had the pleasure of seeing. And if you're in the States and wondering how to get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca delivered to me in less than a week.
