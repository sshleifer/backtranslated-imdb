"Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever made!" ??? Robert Altman In 1955 Charles Laughton directed "The Night of the Hunter", a scary slice of Southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a scary serial killer. One of the most famous sequences of the film consists of two children escaping from Mitchum in a rowboat, the children frantically paddling while Mitchum walks behind them like a monster. Seven years later, Mitchum played an equally scary killer in "Cape Fear," another movie set in the southern United States. This movie had a local lawyer trying to protect his family and also ended up with Mitchum terrorizing people on a boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese, trying to ramify and attack something more mainstream, remade the "Cape Fear", scene of the boat and everything. <br /> <br /> Now we have "The Gingerbread Man" by Robert Altman, another slice of the small town. Southern Gothic. Altman says he consulted "Hunter's Night" as inspiration and approached such a mainstream movie purely because he wanted to "flap his wings and try a popcorn photo," but what he's trying to do here is to deconstruct the film's canonical films. Southern gothic of the genre. <br /> <br /> So, instead of a confrontation on the small boat, we have a clash on a giant ship. Instead of two children being kidnapped, we have two children being safely returned to the police. Instead of getting money hidden, we have money being given promptly by a last will and will. Instead of the honorable lawyer of the 1961 film and the deplorable lawyer of the 1991 remake, we have a three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branagh. Instead of the monster chasing the family, we caught the hero chasing the bad guys. Instead of the monster breaking into the family houseboat, we have the hero hunting the monster aboard the monster's "house ship." Likewise, instead of a serial killer killer, we have an innocent weirdo played by Robert Duvall. . Etc etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Altman continues, reversing everything a little, pulling the edges and doing his own thing. His touch is more apparent during the first half-hour of the film, the film existing in an uncomfortable space between conventional movie narrative and Altman's taste for overlapping dialogues, casual narratives, lurking camera moves, and the way characters do not are very attractive. introduced as they are simply part of what is happening. <br /> <br /> Still, despite Altman's best intentions, the film never rises above mediocrity. Altman is also tied to thriller format conventions to do a lot of damage, his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterbalance other canonical films of the genre. "Gingerbread Man" is therefore very mainstream to work as a purest Altman movie and also Altman to work as a mainstream thriller. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete waste, however. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and the normally intolerable Daryl Hannah, all act succulently. The film also has a nice atmosphere, against an approaching hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns. While not the complete disaster that Scorsese's "Cape Fear" was, the film never becomes anything special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 1990s, Altman made three successive films in the southern United States: "Kansas City," "Gingerbread Man," and "Cookie's Fortune." Unlike "Gingerbread Man," both "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" approach the genre on the wider, looser screens with which Altman felt more at ease. "Kansas City" is the most important of these two films, its hierarchies of class, politics and crime, and its desire to break radically with the typical gangster gangs, would be influential in all serious 21 cinematographic crime writers of the century (see, for example, "The Wire"). That said, "Cookie's Fortune", while a much lighter tale, is perhaps the best photo. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims that this is his first thriller, but directed "Images", a house art thriller. , in 1972. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
