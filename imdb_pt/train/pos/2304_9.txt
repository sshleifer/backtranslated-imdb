I thought this movie was very well done. In the mid-1950s, everything seemed right to me. It was well launched and believable. I usually do not care much about this kind of movie, because they have no depth, but I felt that this movie immersed in the characters and you could feel how they felt, you needed to know them and worry about them. This took me back to my youth and left me to recall a more innocent moment. This film could be enjoyed by both males and females and by all age groups. After the movie was over, I wished there was a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you have not seen it, you should try to get it when it's on TV or rent it ...
