This movie is as unique as it is forgotten ...... A different story is just this, it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain, one can find the ability to love if you have an open heart as well as a open mind. I first saw this on the cable in the late 70's and actually portrayed the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe this film was ahead of its time in describing a small piece of a dark way of life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a forerunner of what is now described as the extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS so that not only the extraordinary extraordinary performances of Meg Foster and Perry King can be recognized, but to show how far we have come and still have to go to relationships.
