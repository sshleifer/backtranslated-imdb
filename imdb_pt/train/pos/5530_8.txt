A must see for anyone who likes photography. dazzling and breathtaking, leaves you in ore. I saw it twice in a movie theater and now on DVD. it behaves well on DVD, but on the big screen that was something else. <br /> <br /> It took my two daughters to see this and they loved it, my eldest wept at the end.but it was she who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it in the video store. it is simple to tell a child's love for nature and, in particular, a fox. in a way, I remembered that the bear told a story that was not documentary format. which works great for kids. not being nailed is very important, you make your own opinion. <br /> <br /> But the star of this film are the filmmakers, how they did what they did. incredible simply amazing.
