I just got out of a preview for this movie. It made me laugh every 30 seconds. The ending was so funny that tears rolled down my face and made me wish I had not bought that big coke. There are definitely some lulls, but overall, a lot of fun. The film lets Steve Carell get a chance to shine after stealing Jim Carrey's spotlight on "Bruce Almighty" and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in his films. Paul Rudd is hilarious as ever. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work on indie dramas (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen should be getting more work because he is so talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I recommend it to those who want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you get offended easily, do not watch this movie. If you are a raging feminist, do not watch this movie. And please, no matter what, even if you think you're one of those "cool" parents, do not take your kids to that movie. Of course, you should let your teenagers go see this movie, just do not watch them. It would make some incredibly strange moments.
