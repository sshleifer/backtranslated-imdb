I meant it in a good way, believe me. Faithful to life, it is not. The whole Oirish thing is kind of thick, but you like the cast here - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. It's all right. I also enjoyed watching Mike Mazurki-of Course he played a boxer, what else? A typical 1940s film full of familiar faces and quick scenes, one after the other. <br /> <br /> Flynn is just like Gentleman Jim, you never go through a one-dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but okay, it's a cartoon and you want to please, that's all. The boxing scenes were very good, the vaudeville Ward Bond timbering was a riot, and you felt like seeing all those billyclub wielding bobbies coming to the scene a few times. <br /> <br /> Really really fun, Flynn was on a roll at that time and it's clear to see why the public loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
