I just saw this movie and fell in love with it. There's a bit of something for everyone, and it's a special treat for everyone when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I almost cried ... there is the tacit perception that time is the most precious possession and is most evident when they are together. This idea was taken from various angles, from marriage to brothers, until finding love in less conventional places. The movie almost makes you anxious for this kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow may very well be the last. Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role as Lachlan. I've always had a soft spot for the accent, but I almost melt away with your interpretation of your character. The way this film was filmed is also beautiful, with the music, the backdrop of the open fields and the excellent acting. All together, this is a wonderful movie that pulls all human emotions.
