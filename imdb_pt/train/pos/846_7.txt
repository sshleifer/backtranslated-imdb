Two years ago I watched "The Matador" at the movies and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously, I was totally impressed by Pierce Brosan's magnificent role. Yesterday, I got this movie again on TV, so I looked at it a little more. Now, I can say for sure that this movie is not so special, but you just have to love it because of a man. <br/> <br/> Brosnan raises his level in my opinion with an incredible performance by Julian Noble, a tired shooting man who has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man who has bad luck: his son died in an accident, his job is not going so well and he is not sure that he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis). I've always liked movies like this; crime film with great touch of humor. Mainly that humor comes from Brosnan while he tells jokes about the dwarfs with great d .... or one of my favorite phrases in this movie: "I look like a prostitute from Bangkok on a Sunday morning, after the left city of the navy. " Brosnan says this with his charm while drinking his margarita normally. I also like Greg 'typical American guy' Kinnear in the role of loser who is very excited made because there are many people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So, I recommend that you watch, possibly, the best role of Brosnan ever. It will make you smile and admire you at the same time. Great Brosnan is not equally great movie.
