I really liked this movie ... it was cute. I liked it, but if you did not like it, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew even though she's not exactly like the books. Old-fashioned clothes are strange when you see them in modern times, but they look good on them. For me, the rich girls did not have clothes that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes - bandaged - in a garage sale and decided to put it all together. All the clothes were cheesy, especially when they wore the cheap shoes in their normal clothes. I do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely was not! Just go to the theater and watch !!! You'll have fun!
