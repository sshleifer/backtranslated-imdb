Why did it seem that her husband still called her Appy? That ruined a great episode and then I can only give it 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a movie. <br /> <br /> It was very Hellraiser what with all skin tearing though I do not know how anyone can survive without skin, the skin is a vital organ for the body, the largest organ, in fact, and we would not die. The more a horror movie is true, the more scary it can be and the more fun it is. <br /> <br /> I admit that the stories of the great directors of terror are very disappointing and very mediocre. <br /> <br /> 6/10 let's go! Yankies get your English!
