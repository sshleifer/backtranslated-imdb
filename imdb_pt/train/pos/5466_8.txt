Excellent, amoral pre-code tale with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired (by Nietzsche's writings!) To expel your sensibilities and explore yourself, use men to your advantage. Not very fair in the German philosopher, but interesting that this was the year Hitler came to power. Stanwyck, even in this young version, does not do much for me, but she certainly performs well here, always directing herself and the film forward. Not as much meat on display here as one might expect, but many dangerous situations and startling jokes and innuendo. Very entertaining, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and I suppose in all honesty not a very eye-catching sight of the female digging gold. Still, it's life!
