He decides (and at each point of the film his own name reverberates through his actions) to put some things in order. <br /> <br /> Alvin is, at this point in his life, a man of great experience, but modest. means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with a speech problem that makes communication a great effort for the public. But it's worth it, because the story of Rose can not fail to leave as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> This movie is the story of a journey. But like all journeys, it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense.

Your goal is very simple and straightforward. Your brother is sick and will probably die and he wants to visit you. He had a quarrel with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a long time. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Alvin knows a lot of people. The way he behaves toward them and the benefit they get from having him known is the essence of this movie. We've come to know who Alvin Straight is, what Alvin Straight does.
