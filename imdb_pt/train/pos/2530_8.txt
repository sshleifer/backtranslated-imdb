One of the joys of picking up the recent Bela Lugosi collection is watching wonderful films like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi team up in a movie that plunges into meteorites and radiation and while science is totally absurd (especially the Karloff camera technique, as Janos Rukh uses to determine the location of a certain meteorite) and downright laughable, I did not care about the lease because the movie is a lot of fun. The effects are well made for the time, the performance is great and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of comic books and science fiction novels from the pulp of the 1940s and 1950s, complete with lightning weapons and ridiculous science. You must watch this movie!
