Bunny Comes 'The Navy of This Man' deserves more credit than it receives, an intelligent script by Borden Chase, directed by 'Wild Bill' Wellman, the film has the right feel to the euphoria and goodwill of post WW11, and none of blind terror that came into play a few years later. Produced in 1944, the defeated Japanese, the battle scenes a bit déjà vu, Tom Drake's melancholy attraction by the radiant young Jan Clayton has solid chemistry, plays truthfully and validates Drake's career in the Metro. The following year, Jan opened on Broadway in 'Carousel'. Wally Beery, a little bleary-eyed, boasts an unbelieving Jimmy Gleason? his memories are an improvement over reality, and give Beery a shadow similar to Ulysses to play against. The LTA's (Lighter Than Air) shots are authentic, photographed in Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 squadron is out of AFB March. Lot 3 doubled to India and Bunny's return? Rabbit coming home? gives Beery an authentic slice of his past, something he wanted to believe was true? So, is the future we come back to again fantastic? now on a larger scale, a newly designed Navy LTA with the capability of launching a reconnaissance aircraft? How expensive, fortunately optimistic? yet: "Do you have to believe this, that's how you make things come true?"
