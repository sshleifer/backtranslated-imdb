I did not see this movie in the theater. I confess an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta to make movies? I remember the Oscar broadcast that year, with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he did not win. How dare he, when there were "real" actors in the race? I'm sorry, John, you should have won. After getting this movie on cable years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all wonderfully done. I also confess that I will never pass when I channel the surf. I have to stop and watch. Over the years, I learned to do most of the dialogue, dance with my thumbs around the waist and learn to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing for me was the supervision, on the soundtrack, of some of Urban Cowboy's songs. "Looking for love" defines the film, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics that did not make it to the soundtrack. Should have been a double CD ........
