Not having seen the movies before (and not being able to support Matt Damon), I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see AS Film Studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon could be fun. <br /> <br /> Fast fight scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and BIG blasts were what took you from your place at TBU. The near-misses between the CIA and Bourne kept you tiptoeing and deeply entertained. <br /> <br /> However, several things really grated my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the fact that the film was only a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence became repetitive and boring. Although Damon kept us entertained and always seemed a step ahead of the CIA, I was getting a little annoyed with Bourne's constant survival. He hit a car and left as if he had hit or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - SHAKY'S WALK. It was so unstable that it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone see my classroom (even the tutors) sick. The tutors told us that if we had ever used it in a movie we did in the classroom, it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. Fair enough if Greengrass wanted us to be there watching Damon and Stiles talking, but surely we would not be shaking our heads so violently! <br /> <br /> But, after all, TBU is a nice movie. and worth seeing. But I do not think it was the best movie of the year, despite being a fun piece of cinema. 8/10.
