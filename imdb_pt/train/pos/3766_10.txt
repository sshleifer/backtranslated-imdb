Visual epic creative of inimitable style. <br /> <br /> This film can not have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic performance. But who dares to say that this movie is not art? I am not a proponent of the idea, that an important movie should be serious, not commercial or bother me with questions. There are even a lot of movies that fit those attributes, which I like. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey is certainly not one of those films. What you get is pure and excessive creativity, with a very positive and charged energy. This movie does not reflect reality. It is friendly-naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me, it would be a great combination of time to live! Except for this song; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well done. I always liked the cinematography and the scenery of this film. Especially at this point Bogus Journey tops his prequel by far. Also the effects are good, and I think most of them are done without CGI. I usually prefer the good old effects in big budget movies. Of course it's 'just another Hollywood movie' out of the opinion of some people. But I think that's in a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A short word for the soundtrack: the whole band and orchestral music fits nicely into the film. In addition, the sound design is not lacking. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to pick up this Winger track from the scene. The station builds the bill and the robots in the van. I love unorthodox camera work in its beginning. <br /> <br /> Let me conclude by saying this: <br /> <br /> This film is very naive and very imaginative! It is much better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - God's wrath. It is absolutely superior to citizen kane, apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil ... ... is even better than Total Recall ... No way!? Yes, the way! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is simply the best movie of all time. Whoever dares to disagree is guilty of "artistic behavior" or likes Terminator Salvation (which is the biggest self-defamation) PS: Part 1 is not the best movie. So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel. Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel! It is not!
