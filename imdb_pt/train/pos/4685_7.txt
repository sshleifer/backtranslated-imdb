In "Love Crimes", by Lizzie Borden (1992), Sean Young plays a coarse D.A. in Atlanta. She is a loner who gets very deeply involved in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who poses as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, takes compromising photos of them, then leaves them. <br /> <br /> Of course, this lonely tough man decides to enter the life of the false photographer by pretending to be his prey, with the intention of bringing him to justice. They meet, they make love, so the next thing she knows is that she's on his lap being beaten. (Note: The beating scene is only in the "unrated" version of this film.) The R-omit version and several other scenes would make the plot more lucid.) This psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images. , as Bergin chasing one of his victims around the room, shaking her with a riding whip. As a thriller, "Love Crimes" is at its best when Sean Young is playing his cat-and-mouse playing with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It's unfortunate that the movie does not end, just stop. That's true. Director Lizzie Borden may have run out of story to tell, but after 92 minutes the credits roll, and we get an intriguing "what just happened?" Unfolding. <br /> <br /> The unfolding of Young's plan unfolds in the engaging style, but the lack of a coherent end will be a detour for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
