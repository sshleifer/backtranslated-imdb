I finally got to see this after hearing great things about it. It actually exceeded my expectations. Considering the budget involved, this was a surprisingly competent and well done film. The lack of finances really helped this movie in many ways, especially given the plot. Like The Blair Witch Project, this movie was best for video filming rather than film. Another bonus: Considering that most low-budget horror movies (even the best of the best) suffer from meditating and intentionally hysterical acting, this film actually had a talented cast (with the exception of one or two characters), particularly the two protagonists . The only thing missing in the movie was an original plot. He borrows a lot from well-known movies like "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn," but if you're like me, films of this nature never cease to be terrifying. In addition, the director keeps things interesting everywhere. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a larger budget and I have the feeling that it will only be a matter of time before we discover ...
