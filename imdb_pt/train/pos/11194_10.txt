Bad script, bad direction, on the best performances, dialogue exhausted. What more could you ask for? For laughter, there is nothing better than that. Zadora's over-action, combined with the clich√©d scenarios in which she finds herself, create a hilarious parody of the "Hollywood" machine. Almost as funny as "Spinal Tap", though clearly not intentional as such. Do not miss Ray Liotta's premiere line, "It Looks Like a Dick".
