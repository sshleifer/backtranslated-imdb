Well, it was a good surprise after all. his trailer did not anticipate a good movie, it was even a bit misleading. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sarcastic and funny. Less real, though, I do not think a guy who has gotten to where he would show signs of such irreverence over everything his current company stands for. It does not become a superior fact only to doubt everything again. The finale of the film, during Dolce Vita's performance, was very tacky, clich√© and rather disappointing. And of course a guy like Pegg's character would not be spending the first week in a New York magazine like that. I hope one day I see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked like a poor actress playing a fool. And by the way, I do not see why she's the "sex symbol" of the year, I see hottest girls on almost every cover of every magazine.
