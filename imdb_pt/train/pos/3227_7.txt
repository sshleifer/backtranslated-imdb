Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action thriller by Paul Anderson (Horizon Event, Resident Evil.) Set on a junk planet, Soldier plays as a cross between Rambo and Shane, with Russell barely speaking as the title character , an "obsolete" genetic soldier left to die. The supporting cast of settlers, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly shaggy Michael Chiklis, is capable. They spend most of the movie fearing Russell, and the rest rushing to save their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he's ever given. With almost no words to say, it conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and looks. It's almost mimicking. When the action sequences begin to work, he kicks his ass - and does it in a strong, silent and natural way. There are flaws. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes a great impression of Frank Burns of M * A * S * H ​​as a commanding officer of weaselly, and Gary Busey breaks a gut (and almost breaks his belt) as Todd's mentor. This is an understated and excellent sci-fi movie, and recommended to anyone who wants a second visit to the Blade Runner universe - David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays.
