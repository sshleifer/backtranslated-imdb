If you are the type of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and compelling storyline, then this movie is not for you. No - you're going to hate it. However, for those who enjoy sweet and slightly crazy comedies, then you will have a good time watching this little movie. Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very cool farmer who never realized needed to file an income tax return. As much as he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is enthusiastic about having company. They love him and treat him like family... And they plan to hire him for their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really all about the storyline that exists. But the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting. A really cool little curiosity from the late 50's.
