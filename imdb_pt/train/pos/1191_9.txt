Robert Taylor as the mad buffalo hunter Charlie Gilson is the main character in this movie. At first I was thinking that Charlie would eventually redeem himself as John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur. But as the film continues, Gilson continues to do more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffalo will soon disappear and he is disgusted with the act of killing. Gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or humans. Debra Paget as the Indian girl is an amazing character considering the self-imposed censorship of the time. She stays with Gilson in complete resignation, even if she hates him. The last scene of a frozen Gilson is unforgettable.
