This is a movie that feels good, about a person's dreams and the impulse or impulse to realize them. It's a beautiful and inspiring film. Why some people have to try to find flaws in every movie that comes out, especially the good ones. Dennis Quaid gives a solid solid performance in this actual story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take yet another chance at a professional baseball career. With excellent support cast, including Brian Cox, as the former former Navy officer, he missed much of his son's achievements without his support. It was good to see him as something different from a villain in a movie. If I have a complaint with this movie is this: Never let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie belongs to a handful of great baseball films like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural." He evaluates two thumbs up and one big "well done".
