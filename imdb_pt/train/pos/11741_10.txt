This beautifully delicate production produced a deep bitter in my being. The irreverent students, the bitter life of the bus driver and the personalities of the teachers present a subliminal debate as the story unfolds. All adult characters look familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, every one of his plausible and well-known views. When a key incident happens on the bus, we are sent on a circuit of points of view. All the adolescent energy babble is just kept under control by the organizers of the trip. Mr. Harvey is feeling a lot of pain everywhere. It reminds me of injured war teachers that I did not understand when I was an irreverent student. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well-shaped British film. The spotless acting, the appropriate scenes, must be widely available, but it does not seem to have been given the right opportunity.
