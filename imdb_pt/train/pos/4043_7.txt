Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very entertaining SCI-FI movie from Japan. I have noticed many nerds from disappointed films who loved the directorial debut movie Versus or his third movie, Azumi. I hear they are blood soaked movies with swords and zombies and all sorts of treats. I honestly went to the video store to buy Versus, but I'm pretty good with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the beginning to the end of the action from wall to wall, Alive is not your choice. There is a lot of action, however, comes as a reward for an entire hour of character buildup. Personally I think it's well done and worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course part of the plot is silly, as with many SCI-Fi action movies and I think subtitles using the term foreign object could have been replaced by parasite. for greater effect. This movie is brutal when it needs to be so faint of heart that it does not need to be applied. <br /> <br /> They kept the budget down for most of the time limiting all action to an underground building (taking a hint from the cube) but the movie does not suffer from it. Another bonus for this film is the intense gothic imagery that is made with great artistic talent during the many flashbacks and sequences of dreams. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
