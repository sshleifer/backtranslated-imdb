Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle. When Mario arrives there, he discovers that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must save the day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can explore everything you want. He can simply walk around, climb trees trying to search for 1-Ups, find level secrets and more. You can spend four hours on one level. No time limit. There are 16 multi-stage worlds, and there are stellar doors, where you need a certain number of stars to enter. Once you enter these stellar doors, you must go through a stage and fight with Bowser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to enter. You enter the world through a painting. There are so many things to do and so many hours of play that I do not see how anyone could not like this game. It's great. This release title is the game that assured players that the N64 would have a good life. All the 3D platform games we know of have something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are commonly used examples. Super Mario 64 is one of the best games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find used, because no one is selling that baby for $ 5 at the pawn shop. A perfect 10.
