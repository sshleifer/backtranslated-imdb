Like many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here, I loved this show! I think it was very well done and thought. Everything about this brand as a spin-off is not to be taken seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the best of the good guy. By using the well-known Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters, it's much easier to engage the viewer with parody humor from the beginning of each 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> There have always been spin-offs from Scooby-Doo that angered the fans. The classic is the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts of the 1980s. These spin-offs had their place: they allowed new content to be sold, they created new fans and kept Scooby-Doo merchandise on the shelves. I would agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Have a clue!" does not fit into this traditional role, but it's probably what I've always wanted Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy to be: an action-packed show focusing on the best and funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, attention to detail, the bad guys, the "Best Friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, the constant mood! Bad Characteristics: None, though the renewed Mystery Machine is very close at times. <br /> <br /> Well done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the smartest cartoons in a long time!
