I love the way this game can literally make you jump from your seat while you're playing. The way the screen jumps and blinks when you're hit is very realistic, while at the same time you have to remember that it's just a game and you're not there. The sound effects and audio are amazing. There are many different weapons and spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not. You receive this stone that can knock down enemies as you retrieve mana to blow up your enemies with even more magic. The best part is that the whole time you are playing you are really nervous and scared of what you might lurk at the next corner or what can jump behind you. If you want to have the complete experience, try playing it with headphones.
