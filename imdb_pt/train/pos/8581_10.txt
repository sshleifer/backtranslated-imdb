This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. All of you who consider this film absolutely absolute are not smart enough to capture all the subtle humor this movie has to offer. This shows us that real life and "fictional" action can produce a winning combination. Plus, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the smartest ways for two people to meet. Name me another movie where you can see all this as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like "They're Gonna Find Your Anus on a Mountain on Mars".
