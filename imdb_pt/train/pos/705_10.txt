I came across Insomniac's Nightmare while looking at independent offbeat movies, and happy to say it did not disappoint. This crazy half-hour ride made me think all the time, and the end was great - one of those NOOOOO moments that really gets you. I showed it to several people and everyone seems to agree with their hands down. The little ghost girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She crawled out of me, I can say a lot. Nanavati did a great job putting those shorts together. All the pieces fit together and you can tell she's a great writer for what she did with this script. So well written. It is undoubtedly the strongest part of the film. The direction was great and the performance was pleasant, but the most important factor here is the strength of the script. Good job for this girl, I can not wait to see more!
