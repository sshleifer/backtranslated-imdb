An absolute classic !! The direction is impeccable, the acting is simply superb. Words are insufficient for this great work. The most definitive film of the Mumbai Police. This film has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a stellar performance, Smita Patil no less. All the actors did their best and the film races thrilled him every moment. This film shakes your whole being and compels you to rethink about many problems that confront our society. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a policeman (Om Puri) who begins his career as an honest man but eventually degenerates into a killer. The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about the Mumbai police. Lots of praise for Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this film, a series of Bollywood films was released, which exposed the nexus between criminals, politicians and police. So, this movie was really a trendsetter. This trend dominated the Hindi cinema scene for more than a decade. <br /> <br /> This movie was a moderate success at the box office. <br /> <br /> Must do for the most demanding movie fans.
