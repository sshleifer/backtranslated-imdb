So what is the reason? Is there any kind of revenge against this AWESOME show or anyone involved in it? Why was the best show I saw in years canceled? I'm addicted I saw this show randomly last fall, and immediately loved it and watched it every week. Then it was gone, and I tried Tivo, but it was not being displayed. So I forgot for a while, until I found the episodes on the ABC website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was invigorating to see something as well developed and developed as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric and comical correction, and House for my intellectual-mystery-idiot correction. My wife loves Gray's Anatomy for her "realism", and I love / hate the show, but it could not be further from the real to me. Too much drama. Whatever can go wrong, it does. But for the first time, there is a REALLY real drama. Real people, real problems. Of course, there are some extremes like an ex-gangster who turned out well, a girl running around the mob, etc., but these people (especially in New York) are really out there, and I relate to each one of them. I can not stay enough. I just hope ABC gets their heads off their ass and continue this show. Have some respect for having quality drama out there. This could be one of the best shows of all time. If someone just leave.
