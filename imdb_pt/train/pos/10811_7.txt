This movie takes you to another era when there was a different pace to everyday life. We have an idea of ​​how families have had to deal with the war and how quickly we send young people to fight. A very touching look from the past and a reminder that the casualties of war do not just happen in the front. <br /> <br /> Luckily, many of us never had to go through what our great-grandparents or fathers went through during a war. This movie, I think, is a little thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks incredibly like a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. It's definitely worth listening to him recite "High Flight" and makes me wonder what he could get with Shakespeare.
