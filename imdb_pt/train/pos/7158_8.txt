Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV is unjustly convicted of stealing, he is sent to 'Camp Green Lake'. In this camp, the director and his two henchmen, Sir Sir and Dr. Pendanski, command that campmates dig holes after hole after hole. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I've never had any intention of watching 'Holes', and I must admit, I just watched the movie because I'm a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a fan of it, then it does not matter. 'Holes' is one of those Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story is lovely written and incorporates a wonderful idea of ​​including flashbacks to the past. These are not a distraction and really give a great story. The whole cast is great. Young stars act well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows that even at age 17, he can act flawlessly. This is a Disney movie that you would definitely enjoy as a family. <br /> <br /> "I learn from failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
