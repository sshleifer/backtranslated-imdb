I've always had the philosophy that every human being has different tastes, I find this movie incredible and I think all college students can agree with me. Nevertheless, this is not a "plot movie", it's about real people and some of the "problems" they face. I found the movie hilarious (especially the parts where they played the games in each other). Simply put, if you're on the same "wavelength" as these people, you'll find this movie incredible. I do not think it's going to win any Golden Globes or Oscar, or that the people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars, but it's sort of a "classic cult" among the young people who could relate to their experience. For me, the one who stands out most is Hans: the Scandinavian, who, according to him, "is not a spectator", receives all (or some) the puppies. "Little people" also play an important role in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I can provide a spoiler and I do not want to do this, just go and get the movie and you will not regret it. I give an 8/10
