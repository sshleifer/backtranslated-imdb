Larry Fessenden was beaten by most of the comments in this forum. Well, the worst mistake, of course, is the marketing of the film and the way the DVD might have been targeted. Obviously, this is not a horror movie, at least not for people expecting something that is bloody and instantly satisfying. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie that seems to be told from the mind of young Miles. Things that are not readily understood by children tend to remain in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world that they can not comprehend. It's obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what's going on in her son's mind. This is also a story of alienation. Of course, the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps a workaholic, who seems to be living in a different world. <br /> <br /> Miles's fears reach a crisis point during the weekend in the country. . That part of New York State, with its winter landscape, barren trees, destroys the boy's imagination. It does not help that he finds a strange figure in the city, this creates even more doubts in his young mind. Ultimately, Miles's world collapses on him and he can not do anything, even evoking the Wendigo spirit. <br /> <br /> The film is very rhythmic and acted. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no matter where she is. Jake Weber is perfect as the distant father who has the opportunity to approach a son he does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan, like Miles, conveys the inner turmoil within him. I found it to be extremely effective, since the entire movie is Miles himself, who has what is happening around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as the ominous Otis, a man who resents the world by the way he left. <br /> <br /> Instead of putting this movie in the air, future viewers should approach it with an open mind.
