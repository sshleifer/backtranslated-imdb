His choice of films, the basic "concept" of production (which puts him in the sets or simulacra of the films he is commenting on) and his delivery are brilliant! But if you want Freud, be aware that you are acquiring Lacan's version of Zizek, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek delivers complex ideas enthusiastically and convincingly. The problem is that it is also quite mercurial and therefore there may be more enthusiasm than real content. Cinemamatically, it's a gem. Psychologically, this will have people of all persuasions (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungians) scratching their heads, but picking up the popcorn anyway. Zizek is a phenomenon and a pop icon for itself.
