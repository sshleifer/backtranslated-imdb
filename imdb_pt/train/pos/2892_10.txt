Cinderella ... <br /> <br /> I did not watch this movie for about five years the last time I saw it. The magic remains. There is something that definitely contains that storybook feel, the songs entertain and the secondary character is please. The villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile. Then there is the most magical of all the Disney, the rats doing the dress and well, you know the rest. To sum up the four of the Disney princess movies are all great, but this is a lovely magical experience, see and enjoy. Oh, of course, Cinderella is wonderful as the main character of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Elene Wood and others the movie has such a feel, you just can not help but smile <br /> <br /> They say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course in the real world some are believers, others are hoper. In this movie it's even more magical when your rainbow comes smiling. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the rest is ... Cinderella
