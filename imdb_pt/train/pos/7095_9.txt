The dazzling adaptation of Terry Gilliam's short film by Chris Marker LA JETEE is full of mind-blowing surprises, but it still touches his heart thanks to the superb cast. Gilliam's talent for ghostly work with the screenplay of David and Janet Peoples to play with his head as much as with poor James Cole (Willis in his closest form to Steve McQueen - better than McQueen, until!), A Time Traveling condemned man from the future who literally does not know whether he is coming or going as a team of scientists continues to send him back to the wrong eras when trying to prevent a 1995 plague that is deadly to humans but harmless to animals. Willis, right-named Oscar Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers. Even the punctuation of Paul Buckmaster's tango style is astounding. This is not a mistake!
