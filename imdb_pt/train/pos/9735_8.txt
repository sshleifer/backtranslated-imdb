Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe "How to lose friends and alienate people". The novel underlying the plot is, for the most part, displaced by a much more interesting "rags of riches" tale. Although the storyline is a bit rushed in several screen captures, there is a sense that; taking nitty gritty out of the way, focusing on the key relationships that make "office politics" and using those almost irrelevant scenes, used only for comic effect. However, it works so well, especially with Pegg in the front seat. The film is ultimately very smart, playing well in the transatlantic relationship that Pegg shares with his peers and fusing the cross between high and low life society very well and quite refreshingly into a plot that despite predictability is something single trip. The different characters in the film are presented well and the cast is definitely a plus point in the film. Both the relationship between Pegg and Huston and the "love and hate" relationship between Pegg and Dunst work so well in a story that is, for lack of a better, charming word. Even Fox, whose main asset is, of course, sex appeal, clashes with what turns out to be a rather sombre character and acts like a "bimbo" role. It's one of those films where every little detail pays homage to a great work. From transsexual strippers to an incredible soundtrack, it all goes very well with what can only be described as a clever comedy.
