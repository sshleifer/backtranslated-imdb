The acting in this film was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa made the heart painful. It was good that the writer isolated Boesman and Lena from other people from their homes, so that we could fully share their triumphs and defeats; the conflicts they shared when they grew up together and apart. It's worth seeing when you put the movie in its proper context.
