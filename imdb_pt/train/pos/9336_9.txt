German private television is little known for copying Dutch and? naturally? US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went so far as the basics: Screwball. <br /> <br /> Do not you support crazy comedy? Do not watch Edel and Starck. Seriously. If you expect the drama of a lawyer to be similar to Law & Order or something, go somewhere else. (Or see Law & Order how brilliant it is at what it does, but I disagree.) E & S is funny, usually tackles thought-provoking themes, is funny, romantic, funny, funny and witty as well. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I'm pretty appalled that the writers did not get better deals after the series finale. And my cynical nature must readjust: private German television productions. German residents will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> In short: Watch. I have no idea what English syncing is, but hey, it's worth learning German just to watch them in four seasons. Pseudo-happy ending included.
