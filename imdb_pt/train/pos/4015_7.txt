One of the most satisfying western all'italiana, Johnny Yuma has the freshness of many WAI made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of genre or clever, eccentric cinema. <br /> <br /> Johnny Yuma is, in most respects, not terribly original, but this does not really count against him. The success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the public's expectations, as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements. Previous and enjoyable experiences are recreated, but with a subtle (or greater) touch that provide continuous interest. The quality of execution is also obviously important. A tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the public. <br /> <br /> Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma is successful. There are numerous reruns of elements from previous films. The setting is the brutal and distorted semi-feudal twilight world shared by many of the best westerns of the "Gothic family" of 1964-1968, such as Tempo di massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic plot of Fistful of Dollars (1964) and the films of Ringo, an unsurprising fact as the screenwriter Fendiando di Leo was involved in both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters of the popular cinema who came out of Cinecitta in the 1960s and 1970s and his work helped provide many of the thematic continuities and coherence to the genre (along with some other personalities in some different circles of actors, directors and writers) . In the plot of the FOD, the protagonist arrives at the city, stimulates a tense situation, then undergoes a near death followed by a resurrection (in some films, like Quella sporca stel nel west (1968), is literally a crucifixion). The Catholic tone of narrative and symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit socialist / populist tendencies of the filmmakers and their films. Ringo's plot, most thoroughly developed by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Guliano Gemma, a selfish protagonist chooses the interest of a community on its own through a relationship with a member of that community (with an ironic ironic trait) . The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco / Mortimer of a Fistful of Dollar (1965). The two scenes of the exchange of weapons belts provide intelligent dialogue and understanding between the two. Numerous films, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, who knows? (1967), use this relationship between an older and younger man (father / son, older / younger brother, Anglo advisor / adversary and peasant revolutionary) as a central dynamic for the plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is the focus on deception and disorientation, labyrinths and mirrors, which are repeated throughout the best WAI. The canons and pueblos of Almeria become literal labyrinths through which the protagonist and the antagonist play games of cat and mouse. What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from another WAI is the quality of the use of the visual / psychological space of the director Romolo Guerriri. together arrangement with intelligent script mechanisms to route the plot. Dialogue has never been very important to ICT and often absurdly unintelligible (there are exceptions such as cynical comments in Django (1966) or Faccia faccia (1967).) The psychological depth of the character is almost entirely through iconic images, they are juxtapositions, and is the description of the general narrative situation. See how the presence of the mortal Samantha is felt during the beating scene - watching from the roof or the background of the action - or as Johnny strips Samantha and Peter for their security and confidence in their power through their stealthy invasions of their ranch, hotel, even room (this again is a FOD theme). Finally, note how there is a focus on finding information. , this is borrowed from the FOD, which was based on the mystery novel Red Harvest, through incidental contacts, wanted posters, conversations heard by chance, looks out of the windows, clocks left unnoticed. the memory or mistaken identities and movements through the undulations created by the actions of Peter and Samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative advances to its conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film was notable in its time for what were perceived as excesses in violence. Of course, these films were no more violent than many American westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of violence and the causes to which it was attributed, which means that it was not violence but the meaning that changed. Johnny Yuma is different and interesting in his use and portrayal of violence, and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What I personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous. , unnamed audiences in Italy and Spain, to whom these recurrent accounts had some meaning and interest. Can the artifact have no intrinsic value in itself? some flint debit from a prehistoric site, a piece of pottery, or a piece of rusty leather and metal? but it is reference to some unnamed presence, lives, which were significant simply because they existed. While Johnny Yuma has intrinsic value, much of the interest for me derives from this connection and the mystery. <br /> <br /> Western list of top spaghetti http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br/> <br /> <br /> Middle SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> For fanatics only (bottom of barrel) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list l = 21849890
