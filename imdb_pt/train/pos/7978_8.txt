This movie contains the ingredient that all revenge movies must have and that is the true emotion. Sadness, love, laughter, anger. There are so many emotions thrown in this movie. From beginning to end, this film is hugely engaging. The plot on the paper sounds like the usual rubbish that is played mostly on the faces of the audience but do not get confused, this movie is powerful. Washington, as always, makes a great performance. <br /> <br /> The plot in a nutshell: the man suffers from depression, a girl brings life to him, children are kidnapped, the man wants revenge. It does not look anything special, but it's far superior to any other similar movie out there. For the moment, TAKEN is a similar movie, but when you compare the two, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. The characters are engaging and everyone performs well, and the direction is great. Mexico City looks alive, it looks like Mexico City, it smells like Mexico City. Everything is portrayed brilliantly. the style of direction was something that I liked and brought the best of Mexico City <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you will bring once a year to watch again or a movie you will beg family and friends to watch. From start to finish you're rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller coaster ride. There is enough action to keep you happy, there is character development enough to please you, and then there is Washington to bring a smile to your face. Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed
