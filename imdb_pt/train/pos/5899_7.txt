Attractive idea ... the saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a small and tiny county of Lampidorra. That country, which was not even in North America, became the 49th state ... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was done in 1952 ...) Linda travels to the country that has inherited, and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and even stranger people. At one point, she sings a song she claims to be from her people, the Navajo, and she grows more and more foolish from there ... although Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and omnipresent smile never get creepy or dull. There are other songs scattered as citizens sing to receive their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of technicolor, or some equivalent, the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde, the British guy Tony Craig, a cheese seller. Bogarde made a huge impact on the UK film industry after serving in the war, and was even awarded the QE II. Craig and "the new princess" keep hitting each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as Lampidorra's financial woes worsen ... Funny little farce ... in the mold of the Marx Brothers movie. Note also that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our small project, and was married for 50 years! Guest was best known for writing and directing his science fiction films in both the UK and the US.
