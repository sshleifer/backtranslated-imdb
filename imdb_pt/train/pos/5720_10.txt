I saw "The Grudge" yesterday, and wow ... I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror movies and I really enjoyed this movie. There were so many 'surprise' scenes (what's the word in English?) That made you jump in its place. However, many screams from the audience made it hard not to laugh. I think the most frightening scene was ... on the bus, when the face blinks in the window, or when Yoko is walking without his chin. The makeup is also very good. Sometimes you could actually see it was there, but it was still adding a strange look to the scene. The boy was really very good, so cute without makeup and so terribly scary with it. Next time I hear a noise, I'll probably feel very scared ...
