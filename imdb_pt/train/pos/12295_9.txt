"Hotel du Nord" is the only Carné film from the 1936-1946 era that has dialogues not written by Jacques Prévert but by Henri Jeanson. Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet / Arletty couple than in the couple of lovers Annabella / Aumont . The latter is rather mild, and her story strangely reminds of Edith Piaf's song "les amants d'un jour," except that the story of the singer is tragic. What is fascinating today is this popular little world, the Saint-Martin channel. This film is dear to fans of French films for another very special reason. The pimp Jouvet tells his protégé Raymonde that he wants an air change (atmosphère) Because she does not understand the meaning of the atmosphere of the world, prostitute Raymonde (Arletty wonderful) thinks it is an insult and she offers this line, that is, undoubtedly the most famous of all French cinema: In French: "Atmosphère? Atmosphère? est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?" Attempt to translate: "Atmosphere? Atmosphere? I have an atmosphere face? This is our French "Nobody is perfect".
