I strongly disagree with the "Ctomvelu" regarding Jim Belushi's talent. I really like Belushi. Of course, I was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because I was a HUGE fan of his late brother John. But Jim has a charm on the screen that took him so far - and he has developed it well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of her first films - her weight is a godsend (is not this true for most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it's touching and comforting, so if you're into automobile chases, bangs and free sex, then you might want to get past this - it's a hot movie from three lost soles that lie. Do not get me wrong, I'm all for the above three keys to a hit movie, but I also like a nice, solid tale like this. <br /> <br /> And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch perform well, the real star of this film is Alisan Porter - who is absolutely adorable. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened to her career, but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball (agent? parents? herself?) should be filmed. You could not ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this movie, and even then, nothing has been noticed since. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
