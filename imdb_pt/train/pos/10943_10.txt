I have to vote 10 out of 10 on the rare chance that she'll see this review, pity me, take me to Hollywood and get me involved in her weird, funny world. But in all seriousness, it was good. The first episode is obviously finding his feet, but there's that weirdness of Silverman going all the way. It's not some kind of high-comedy, but that's a good thing, a lot of laughs, and that would not be right with clues when you laugh, it's for the audience to hear your inner-joke laughing at the absurdity of it all. I can easily see this as being the bizarre show Drew Carey with her strange characters and incredibly strong central character. Worth watching, wait for the following episodes. A very good chance of the usual comedy out there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me....
