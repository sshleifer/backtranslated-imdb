This supernatural suspense by Peter Weir is actually one of the most astonishing and fascinating films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain performs best here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of aboriginal youths accused of murder. As he approaches the case, he learns more about the main culprit, Chris, not less about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, who seems to be a race of supernatural beings who have lived in Australia for thousands of years. At the same time, unusually high rains seem to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, which will drown the world. <br /> <br /> The dream sequences and supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in supporting roles, as is the guy with the difficult name that plays Charlie, the old Aborigine who can turn into an owl. The climax and final do not disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall by surprise after a promising hour. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a drama too and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
