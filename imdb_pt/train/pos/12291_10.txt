A real classic. Wonderfully filmed and acted. It reveals an area of ​​Paris that is alive and full of comedy and tragedy. Although the 'Hotel du Nord' area and the hotel itself still exists, it is not as gay (in the original sense of the word) and cheerful as it should have been. The film makes a longing for the past, which was lost, with a sigh and bittersweet.
