I really liked this movie I saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details. I think this movie is so much better than the drawing is not as black and white as it. I especially liked how they made the Grinch such a full character and gave a cause of why he was just the way he was, the villain in that movie was not the current Grinch but the Major, very different from the original drawing. Jim Carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for kids and adults.
