I just watched an episode about Brad, the cocaine addict who turned to a drug-addicted life on the streets after his cyclist career was destroyed as quickly as it started. I have to say that the story about his bicycle career was more painful than drug addiction. Here is this young man who is winning bike rides left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arrival he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes who ever lived, and is generally insensitive and hostile to everyone in general. Understandably, he is soon invited out. Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to do his act like an idiot? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was confused about how the show was set up, as it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We see images of him flapping and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack. I did not even know it was cool to show, but why would a film crew just follow it and film it? Do they do this in the hope that this guy will reveal his life and give them some stuff for a good TV episode? <br /> <br /> Either way, it's an enlightening show because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control they can take on people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you actually see how much families and friends suffer from the indifference of the addict, although I have to admit that in the end everything seems a little clean. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here, everything has a bit of a happy feeling forever in the end, and I have a feeling this is a very unusual occurrence in real life. But still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can never complain about that much?
