Greetings again from the darkness. What a relief ... a thriller that is really exciting! The new IT "Rachel McAdams" ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates the screen time in this classic suspense thriller by the famous horror film director Wes Craven (films "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" ). Craven even has a tip as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this work, is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes, as we see McAdams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone. It is natural. When she meets Cillian Murphy (the scarecrow in "Batman Begins"), in what appears to be a chance, the film really takes off. Seeing the two types of yuppies flirting while the audience knows something is brewing is a cinematic witchcraft! The boarding sequence on the plane is fascinating and the 30 minutes on board are unbearably claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing about the involvement of others and whether anyone will come to their rescue. <br /> <br /> As with many thrillers, the only disappointment occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero. An interesting plotting device leads us to believe that little Rachel has the frustration needed to see this, but we can not help but shrink a little. The most exaggerated scenes involve the hotel's irritated guests, an irritating airline passenger, Cillian's injury and the FX at the hotel. The strength of the film lies in the development of the character and in the psychological games between the protagonists. Unfortunately, the fine screen veteran Brian Cox is underutilized, but overall this is an above average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the end.
