Diagnosis Murder has been shown on most weekdays on BBC1 since I used to watch it while I was sick from school a good 10 years ago - I know I should not really like it, the same way I should not like it 'Murder she Wrote 'but I'm totally addicted to both and I even have the DVD boxes ... OK, I know it's sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke carries the show while he stars as Dr. Mark Sloan. Los Angeles Community General Hospital physician who also advises police for the LAPD - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - Dick's real-life son) is a cop who needs his father's help in many suspicious deaths . <br /> <br /> Along with the walk is Dr. Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley), the resident pathologist at Community General and in the first two seasons you had Scott Baio playing Dr. Jack Stewart, who increased and left the series in 1995, hoping to continue with bigger and better things ... he should have stayed where he was, he has not done anything worthy since ... and his only theatrical appearance for many years was in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies. ... Oh, darling !!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dr. Jack Stewart was replaced by the young Dr.Jesse Travis, played by Charlie Schlatter, who went into Baio's place comfortably. <br /> <br /> The series is highly implausible, but what the Whodunit series is not? (Murder, she wrote - everywhere Jessica goes, someone ends up dead, or the understated priest Dowling Mysteries on a priest solver of murder with nun's helper) <br /> <br /> The series was much lighter until 1997, because a support cast that included the clumsy Norman Briggs hospital manager played by Michael Tucci and Nurse and Mark's secretary, Dolores, played by Delores Hall. After 1997, these two characters were no longer included and the series became more difficult. episodes included much more action, an episode in which the entire hospital exploded. <br /> <br /> This was a family program for the Van Dyke, because just like Dick's Son Barry, you also had Dick's Daughter And all your Grandchildren making an appearance in several episodes. As the series continued, it got a little silly, an episode I remember of Dick van Dike playing his whole family, which was a bit out of the ordinary, but in Whole 'Diagnosis Murder' was a really good TV show that had several good Guest Stars. Since this show ended in 2001, Dick & Barry have appeared together again on TV Hall's 'MURDER 101' series by The Hallmark Channel, pretty much following the same path, and still nice. Dick, now in his 80s, does not seem to change much, and looks set to work until the bitter end. <br /> <br /> TV show **** OUT OF ***
