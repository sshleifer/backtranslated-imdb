I have to be honest, I was expecting such a bad flop because it really looked like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. But that was not the case in this very funny movie (sometimes strange). I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumbaa, the story with Simba and he having trouble sleeping was funny. The bubble in the jacuzzi, and when Pumbaah leaves, the bubbles stop. It's all harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will last for a while because it is very good for a straightforward movie for video and DVD. Although the film looks a little weird and kinda stops at the end, it works. 8 out of 10
