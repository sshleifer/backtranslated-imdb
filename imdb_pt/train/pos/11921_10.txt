this movie was one of the best disney movies I've ever seen. great for the whole family to watch. the ideas may be a bit exaggerated, but it's a well-being comedy and the acting is great. I love the boy, j. and the Academy Award winner adrien brody may have been very short but very memorable. highly recommended.
