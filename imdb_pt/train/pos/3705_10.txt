I do not understand the low rate of 5.7 in this movie. It is a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospheres. The tone is reminiscent of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, to the place (Savannah). The acting is strong and I was struck by the verisimilitude of Kenneth Branagh's Southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is effective in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB. Great nude scene full of her too. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly standardized, but effectively executed.
