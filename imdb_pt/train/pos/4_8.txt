FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theater movement in New York in the 1960s (the origins of Off Off Broadway). Although not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly amusing, yet deeply disturbing story about love, sex, personal freedom and revenge, a serious tale of morality even more relevant now at a time when Congress wants to ban gay marriage destroying our Constitution. The story is not about being gay, however, it is about love and sex that do not conform to social norms and therefore should be removed through violence and hatred. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but, like any great fable, it is not really about animals, it's about something bigger - stifling conformity in America. <br /> <br /> The theatrical version gained international acclaim in its original production, toured the US and Europe and, with others of its kind, influenced almost every theater that came after it. Fortunately, we preserved here the show virtually as it was originally designed, with the original cast and original director, Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> It's not a popular, easy-to-use studio movie - it's a kind of aggressive, haunting, glorious, deeply emotional and wildly imaginative narrative that you'll never forget. And that can change the way you see the world ...
