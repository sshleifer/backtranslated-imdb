Sidney Stratton is having trouble keeping jobs in several textile factories, mainly because of her experimentation in the textile labs. Stratton is experimenting with a formula for a new fabric that would create the final fabric, which never gets dirty, never wrinkles or wears. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric, he creates enemies in all textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and owners (who will lose money since a mill has exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes England's most hunted man . The film is ideal and only Ealing could have done it. Guinness's performance (and a large supporting cast such as Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film a delight, but the true hero is the story itself, a good satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance and suspense. Evaluation, 8.
