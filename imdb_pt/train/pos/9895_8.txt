A group of popular high school students makes a cruel joke with nerd Marty (a sympathetic performance of Simon Scuddamore), which makes him terribly disfigured. Five years later, the gang returns to college now crumbling and abandoned for a meeting. Of course, Marty, furious and vindictive, appears dressed as a court jester to demand revenge terribly against his executioners. Writers / Directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale publish all the affectionate clich√©s that make the 80's so fun: suspense, fright jumps, Steadican shots, a ferocious storm, an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack, a good knowledge of female nudity free, a totally ridiculous "what the heck?" supernatural climax, sticky makeup f / x, and one of those endearing "everything was just a dreadful dream" non-final fake. In addition, elaborate murder kits deliver horrifying goods: the highlights include the stomach of a man exploding after he drinks poisoned beer, a lady taking a sour bath, a guy being crushed by a huge tractor, and two people being electrocuted on the means. of having passionate wild sex. Thirty British cult horror singer Caroline Munro is hilarious as an American teenager in the first third of the film. The cast gave solid performances, most notably Carmine Iannaccone, as clever leader Pollall, Billy Hartman, Frank Morgan, and Donna Yeager, Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has a special guest appearance as Munro's despicable agent, Manny. Harry Manfredini's melancholy and strident music shamelessly recycles his "Friday the 13th" notes. Alan Pudney's cinematography does the trick. Good fun.
