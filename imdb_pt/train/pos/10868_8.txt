I always thought it would be a long, boring Talking-Heads movie full of static internal jacks, man, I was wrong. "Election" is a highly fascinating and captivating thriller drama with a deep and realistic view of the origins of Triads-Rituals. Characters are constantly in motion, and although as a spectator you are always a stranger, you can still feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. In addition, Johnnie To manages to create some truly opulent images due to the meticulously composed lighting and the atmospheric contrasts of shadows. Although there is almost no action, the ending is still shocking in its relentless description of brutality. A cool movie that deserves more attention, and I started to really enjoy the minimalist acoustic guitar score.
