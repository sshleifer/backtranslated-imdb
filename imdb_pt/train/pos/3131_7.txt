I really liked that. I thought it would be a documentary, but it turned out to be a good joke. <br /> <br /> I think this was well done, basically an extended TV movie program, but due to the rather original characters or actors will want to have fun and have fun helping this work in a great old style Innocent way. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the original TV series then I'm sure you'll enjoy this. <br /> <br /> Q
