What a wonderful film. The characters were not just lively but alive, mirroring real life every day and conflicts within a family. Each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends. <br /> <br /> History has a real flow to life that the viewer can assimilate and be part of the drama, laughter and tears as the plot of the film develops. The script does a good job of capturing the common emotions, actions, and reactions of the characters to conflict, opinion and resolution. <br /> <br /> It's not an epic, but it's a very good movie to watch with your loved ones. . Lots of head-nods and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy.
