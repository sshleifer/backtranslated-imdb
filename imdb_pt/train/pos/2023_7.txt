Spoilers ..... <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV some time ago and I remembered this production as less exciting than most of Beeb's dramas. I came back to watch DVD this week and I still have the same impression. It is a good story at first, but it weakens when the heroine becomes so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly despicable husband when she is sick and I was totally irritated by her holiness. I suppose this was the "right thing to do" when the story was written, as well as contributing a lot of anguish, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband, since marriage made her nothing more than her possession, much less Let's continue scandalously with a lover, as I hope much of the modern public would like to see. But it is difficult to accept holiness today and especially when this heroine had a strong and brave admirer ready to defend her against someone and everyone. So the story as in the movie I am mistaken. It is well done according to the novel, but a bit annoying as per the type of life today. <br /> <br /> Unshakeable hero Gilbert was certainly a saint to tolerate variable and often enigmatic behavior and persistent self-denial and be so consistently supportive. Then I felt a great pity that when Helen was finally free to be with him, the script did not allow him to take a little more than a minute to hug for a quick hug before the titles appeared. This was completely ridiculous when we waited all this time with all that immense feeling about her unworthy husband for a decent dialogue and a good hug between hero and heroine. Instead, the ending was as if the filmmakers had run out of time or finances or simply could not be bothered. "Here you are - one minute, do what you can, then cut out how the director wants to go home now ..." I was totally dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> However, very high compliments to the acting of Toby Stephens, a perfect and very handsome hero, and Rupert Graves, a superbly unpleasant and self-pitying villain. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfactory within the boundaries of the script that forced her to be a depressing and quite hypocritical victim most of the time. <br /> <br /> That said, I love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a better view than much of the "modern" drama on TV these days. So 7 stars, because despite the irritations is still a good watch.
