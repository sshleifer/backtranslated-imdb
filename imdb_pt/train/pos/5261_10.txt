Do you like really inventive comedy or do you love "wedding penetrations", if the answer is the latter, stop reading now. I can not believe this movie is not rated better. Basically, Meadows plays a character not unlike Austin Powers. There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama. Of crudeness - Leon playing with him on the porch, the ex-boyfriend cheated to eat. . Oh well. To inspire the sex of lunatic, the Broadway routine, the voice. Meadows is great as the childish but very sweet Leon. Some big lines "do not blame the wang" "freaky deaky sex world" too much. . . Because this movie was not huge is a mystery. Great comedy.
