from the point of view of a NASCAR Maniac as I am, the movie is interesting. You can see many race cars since 1983. Even difficult, the racing scenes are not very realistic. But I have to admit, I did not see any race before 1995, because before that, they did not show any NASCAR races in Germany) from the vision of a Burt Reynolds fan like I am, the film is basically what we are accustomed to see of Reynolds in the 80s: Burt at the wheel of a fast car, as in his Bandits Movies. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must see. If you love only one of these two things, I also recommend watching it. If you do not like either NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give it a try, but remember, this movie was far from winning the Academy Award. <br /> <br /> It's the typical 80's mood. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and the Police Academy, you'll also like it.
