This is the final episode we deserve. At the end of last season, things were left in a climate of 'life goes on', which was hardly the end that this realistic series deserved. Although not a happy show, this series has always been one that made you think (something rare on television), and this is no exception. "Is death justified by reason?" "Does morality reflect society, or is society shaped by morality that is selected by the few in power?" 'What is a just death and can it exist?' All these questions, and more, are put by the writers of this program every week, and this is their final thesis. Good acting, great writing, great camera work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you saw the series and missed it when it was first run, then hold a copy somehow. If you've never watched the show when it's running, then it's going to be on its own, but it can be difficult trying to keep track of who the characters are and what they're alluding to in their various past. For those of us who have been avid viewers of the series over the past two seasons, this is a very satisfying sight.
