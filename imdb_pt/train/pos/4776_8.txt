I was watching this movie at one of my usual times, which is very real late at night. Normally, if a movie does not interest me, I start falling asleep and have to break into the refrigerator to stay awake. At first I thought that was what I had to do since the rhythm of the movie began slowly along with the fact that his shots tended to remain with the character for a long time. But after a bit, I start to get more into the movie, as more is revealed about the main character through his telling story. In the end, you feel like you know him all your life. The film kept so much of my interest that I did not even know the sun was about to rise. <br /> <br /> There is not much of Lynch's bizarre style, but there are quirky characters to make the movie entertaining.
