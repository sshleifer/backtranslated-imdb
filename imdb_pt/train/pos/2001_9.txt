I was lucky to see "Oliver!" in 1968, on a big screen in Boston when I was a teenager. Later, during the summer of 1969, I was glad to see that this movie was still playing at a prominent movie theater in Leicester Square, London, after winning the Oscar for Best Picture of the previous year. <br /> <br /> The success of "Oliver!" both on stage and on the screen, I remembered that not every talent starts on Broadway and ends in Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, who is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was admirably brought to the London stage by Lionel Bart of Great Britain. His charming musical became a hit in New York and around the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. Musical ensembles and numbers are incomprehensible. The song "Who will buy?" demanded hundreds of actors and the British film director really deserved his Oscar for putting it all together in a perfect way. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but above all, it is a tribute to the good craftsmanship of British film studios such as Shepperton. Good show! Other film studios in Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have also given the world many films to cherish over the years.
