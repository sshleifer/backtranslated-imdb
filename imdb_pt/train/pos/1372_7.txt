"Party Girl" takes advantage of the tremendous charm of Parker Posey. In fact, sometimes the film seems to be a vehicle in which Posey is allowed to perform, as it usually is in real life. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a treat for Mrs. Posey's fans. Ms. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a crazy trip through downtown Manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to having fun in the different clubs she frequents constantly. This is an era that was still more naive than that area and the adjoining districts of the Meat Market. At least there are no pretensions in the movies and we see the usual people in their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes an incredible Mary. It's because of Parker Posey that we like the movie more than if another actress had played Mary. It is the complete image. The rest of the cast is good.
