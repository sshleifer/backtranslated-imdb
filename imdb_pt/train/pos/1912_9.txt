I'll keep it short and brief, the people who wrote the story lines for this show are cool, the actors are perfect for the roles they play (CJ's character is legendary) and they have so much chemistry on the screen that they do what is a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first episodes that are probably coming back in 6/7 months, I wondered what happened to Paul. I was destroyed to find out that he had died when I browsed Google. He was so funny and played his character perfectly, an overprotective father, who likes to keep his daughters out of the spotlight and away from the boys. <br /> <br /> The comedy, I think, went from strength to strength, even without Paul in it. <br /> <br /> Besides, I think most people would enjoy this by watching.
