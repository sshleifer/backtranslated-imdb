Writers Perry and Randy Howze have created a very interesting story in "Chances Are". <br /> <br /> Using the idea of ​​a reincarnated man who returns to his ex-wife's house many years later, the plot takes unexpected and delightful turns. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, a 24-year-old Jr. performs delightfully, expertly assisted by Cybil Shepherd as the widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has the right chemistry for this prank, playing each other with a graceful style. I watched this movie several times on tv, and each time I found it more enjoyable.
