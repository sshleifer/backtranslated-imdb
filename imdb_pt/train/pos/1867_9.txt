this is a film about life, the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I challenge someone not to shed a tear until the end of the movie. This is more than just a shrill movie, it's an engaging and thought-provoking drama with excellent performances from the entire cast, but especially from Derek Luke and Denzel Washington. 7 years later, I'm surprised that Luke is still a virtual stranger and Washington has only directed another movie. However, in addition to a slow buildup, the story of the trials and tribulations of this adoptive child and how it still affects him in adulthood is the kind of film that stays with you long after you've seen it. Like many photos of fox spotlight, this was more of a hit and did not garner the acclaim of the mass critique it deserves. The scene in which Antwone finally finds her mother summed up the film for me, there were so many ways it could have been done and it could have been all weird or it could have been unrealistic, but Washington found the right tone exactly, her mother never said a word and could only shed a tear, while Antowne simply asked why. Her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? One of the most moving cinematic scenes I've ever seen.
