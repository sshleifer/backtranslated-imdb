Return to Cabin by the Lake is perhaps one of the few sequences that can live up to the original. She had dark humor, good suspense, pretty girls, and of course a psychopathic killer. What are we missing? I think nothing. Except we're left with a small amount of Gore and Nudity because it was made for television. Besides being one of the best sequences, it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. Recommended for all.
