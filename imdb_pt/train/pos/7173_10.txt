I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on Starz cable network. It is undoubtedly one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! It chronicles San Francisco Bay Area artists and creative talents responsible for some of the best films ever made. In addition to the well-known artists listed, it also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment on Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it's released on DVD - this is a must for any collection on the history of film and brilliant movie production. If you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them, you will not be disappointed.
