I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I bought the tickets and then checked the reviews on IMDb. I was worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which obviously should be scary, were actually quite humorous, almost like in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I do not consider this a bad movie. Not a great movie either. Just a good horror movie. It does not depend much on special effects, but on camera angles, acting and music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah did a great job, quite convincing. The other actors definitely were not bad either, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are good (and I do not care that the sets are exactly the same ones that were used in the Japanese original). The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I've seen enough horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Good. <br /> <br /> The film had some cool scenes that were almost original, like the junk tracks, the simple special effects for the ghosts, the boy's eyes, the cat that made strange noises, the buzz. the dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> Do not go if you want to see Sarah in another episode of Buffy, because it's very different from your work on Buffy, much more serious. Do not go if you just want to watch movies that get Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave a 7.
