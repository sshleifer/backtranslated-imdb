I first saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. I really hoped to see the movie when it was announced and more than lived up to my expectations. I bought the DVD and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "It's A Wonderful Life", I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and a great cast led by Roger Rees surrounds him! Scott proves yet again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. How can one be remembered as Patton and Scrooge? Scott does it so easily. The direction is wonderful with the beautiful scenery, costumes and music that give the film a special feel of the time, place and time represented. You will simply love this movie and will put you among your favorites to watch during the holiday season.
