In Iran, women are officially banned from male sporting events. In June 2005, the Iranian national soccer team has an important game against Bahrain at the Azadi Stadium for the qualification of the World Cup. A group of Iranian girls and soccer lovers dress like boys and tries, unsuccessfully, to enter the stadium they are being arrested. <br /> <br /> Football (and the Flamengo team), the beach and movies are my greatest passions; That's why I loved this little gem about a bunch of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi of "The White Balloon," "The Mirror," and "The Circle," shot this movie the day Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most charming films I have ever seen. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
