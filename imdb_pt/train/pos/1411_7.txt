Greetings again from the darkness. Stunning photography highlights this Disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the ruggedness of the animals that live in the desert. For anyone over 40, Disney and Mutual of Wild Kingdom of Omaha have provided much of our knowledge about wildlife since our childhood ... when there was no channel dedicated to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What always fascinates is how difficult are the circumstances for many of these majestic creatures. Watching the elephants walking for days, almost delirious for lack of water, is so painful. But their nightly battle against the lions is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some of the underwater outlets are out of breath. Mommy and the humpback baby are beautiful and watching the great white shark attacking their prey is as cold as "Shark". The most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I had never seen so many details of the vastness of the interval. <br /> <br /> Do not think that most kids today will get too excited about it, but it certainly is one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries I have. seen.
