The second part (actually, episode 4-8) of the hit Danish TV series is slightly less than the first, but there are lots of laughs and scares as well. This time, Udo Kier plays two parts, like the baby monster and his demonic father. Other prominent pieces this time are Doctor Krogshoj, by Søren Pilmark, who must face the horrible revenge of Dr. Helmer, and again the patient Mrs. Drusse tries to solve the mysteries, Miss Marple style. It ends in a cliffhanger and after the death of the main actors Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr. Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), you wonder how they might do part III, but I hope Von Trier gives it a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, the Down Syndrome Dishwasher # 2, died shortly thereafter, too. Look for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
