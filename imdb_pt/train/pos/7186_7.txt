There have been many Zorro movies made over the decades, but it's a shame one of the best is probably one of the least watched. <br /> <br /> The Zorro Combat Fight is a bit different from other Zorro movies. First, it's a Republic series in 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro is not played by a studio star like Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but by actor Reed Hadley. Although Hadley does not have as strong a presence in proceedings as the others, he does a proper job, aided by the fact that he is not the only hero here; as the title indicates, he has a legion of fights to call. <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the setting is not California. The story here takes place in central Mexico in 1824, where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous population and a band of bandits to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly created Republic of Mexico. Something, Zorro, and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, there's at least one incredibly extravagant moment per episode, from the bickering "twang" sound effects to ridiculous acting. But overall, this represents one of Republic's best shows of all time, and probably the best of Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or sinuous. action - fans of the Indiana Jones movies will notice MANY bits borrowed from this series.
