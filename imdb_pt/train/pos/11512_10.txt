When originally screened in the United States in 1972, "The Night Stalker" became the best-selling TV. movie in history. Based on the unpublished novel by Jeff Rice, he told how a fearless investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak (the late Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern Las Vegas. When it hit British television four years later, it did not have the same impact, but my friends were talking about it at school on Monday morning, as indeed I am. We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we have seen. <br /> <br /> I did not know the existence of 'The Night Strangler' until it appeared almost a decade later. I.T.V., who exhibited the films of 'Kolchak', apparently decided to pass the series of spin-offs; they felt that 'Barnaby Jones', starring Buddy Ebsen, was another draw, and in any case, viewers might confuse 'Kolchak' with 'Kojak'! For years, my only source of information about the program was an article in Fangoria magazine. I could not even buy Jeff Rice's novels. <br /> <br /> So something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 launched the program as part of a Friday series dedicated to the supernatural called 'Mystery Train', presented by Richard O'Brian. 'Kolchak' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of 'The Brain Eaters' and 'Earth Vs.The Spider'. The opening titles were cut, removing Kolchak's whistle and the final credits ... well, there was none. <br /> <br /> The first episode screened was 'Werewolf'. I can not say I was very impressed, but I was with him, and I'm glad I did! <br /> <br /> I really wish I had seen him in 1974. My twelve-year-old self would have loved it. Scary, humorous, exciting, no wonder it triggered Chris Carter's imagination. <br /> <br /> The biggest asset of the show was, of course, McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was a common figure, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative. He was to the supernatural what 'Columbus' was for the crime. The late Simon Oakland was also great as Kolchak's grumpy boss, Tony Vincenzo. The scripts overflowed with wondrous and dry wit. I found myself enjoying the show more for humorous content than for horror. When the twenty episodes were over, I felt desolate. <br /> <br /> 'X-Files' appeared a few years later and filled the void - but only up to a point. I wanted Kolchak and Vincenzo back. I'm glad the show has never been revived. Without Oakland, it would not have been the same. <br /> <br /> I have Rice's books now and read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King scored the first (in his book "Danse Macabre") as it is as good as anything he has written. <br /> <br /> All right, so some of the monsters were hardly the state of the art, but so what? The new 'Kolchak' has completely lost the point of the original. What you do not see is sometimes more frightening than what you do ... <br /> <br /> Best Episode - The Worst Episode in 'Horror In The Heights' - 'The Sentry'
