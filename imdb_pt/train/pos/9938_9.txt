We bought the DVD of "Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Once upon a time ... life" for our bilingual children, because they all loved the "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German) / " Once upon a time ... Man "(English) series (parents of us had seen them as children) and even exceeded high expectations! The series is very well done, does not show its age, and our children of various ages are very fond of watching it. At the same time, they learn things that parents did not know until much later. The series covers everything to do with the human body from organs, all directions, blood, infection, antibodies and more in animated episodes of 20-25 min. Topics that some people may find "sensible", such as digestion and reproduction, are covered in an elegant, discreet and child-friendly way (the breeding episode begins especially when the baby begins to grow), while still (as typical) it is informative and funny. <br /> <br /> Children are often fascinated with the functioning of their bodies and, through the episodes, acquire an understanding of it in the context of their environment. The format of the episodes alternates between the outside world (a family with two children) and the interior of the body. For example, in the episode that covers the infections, the boy accidentally cuts himself and the wound is infected and the episode shows how the body reacts to it. In the same way, the episodes in the directions, e. listen, see, relate what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world, and the episode of breathing and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete life cycle including (briefly) where the oxygen comes from (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best programs for kids ever - I would say it's a must see for all families with kids!
