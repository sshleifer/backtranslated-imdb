I saw this movie with my family and it was great! This film is more than just a documentary (which offers no more than cold facts) with long / mono-letrologist and many graphics ... The full "power" of this film comes from the stunning images being filmed underwater , in the movie. air or the Arctic. By watching this movie, you can learn more about our planet than just by reading a book, it shows that we are inserted in the circular flow of life. This movie is not just for "environment fanatics", although people who want to see a good movie with a message should watch it. This movie taught me that we are not just living on earth ... we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
