This film, recently voted as a public favorite at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005, is inspiring and exciting. A famous conductor, forced to retire by illness, returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir and finally find fulfillment in his music. Based on Swedish traits of keeping things within himself and the island character of a small Swedish village, this film develops each of his characters as well. superbly directed, represented and sung, brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all. I hope you find distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, see!
