I.Q., in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) really was a boring guy. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suitable for Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James was. Anyway, everyone involved in this movie did an absolutely extraordinary job. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this sweet, charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you for any fan of Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan that you have not seen. You have a lot of laughs, so go to the store, rent it or buy it, relax with a friend and watch.
