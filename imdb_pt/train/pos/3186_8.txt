I find this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and easily digestible, the humor is light and clean, and since the plot involving misidentification is fairly common, I see myself eager to see how this film reveals that story. It turns out to be very good. The performance of female leadership is admirable; his portrait of an innocent, naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies for David's sophisticated role was very charming. I also think that Vera's dance is very, very well done. I find myself drawn to my toes as she hurls herself onto the stage effortlessly and without fail. <br /> <br /> For those who have had movies full of profanity nowadays, you will enjoy this movie completely.
