But if you like muppets, I dare you not to like this one. Basically, the same regurgitated plot (this time in New York, not in Los Angeles) features lots of fun and muppet hi-jinx appearances. Many of the muppets leave the movie early because they focus on Kermy and Miss Piggy. I happen to like it a lot. Fun to watch with your kids.
