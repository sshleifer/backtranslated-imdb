I have plenty of time for all of the Columbus movies, but this one in particular was extremely well written, and the solution in the end very effective. However, my main memory is the opening of a scene in the middle of the movie, between Columbo and the killer (I apologize if I did not remember every detail of that exactly). It is the most impressive image of Columbus I have ever seen: the view is from within the darkness of the closet where the victim was murdered, and in the room beyond, which is illuminated by the light of day. Columbo is sitting in a high-backed armchair facing the door (and us), staring at the closet and almost silhouetted by the contrast of light. There is no sound. The camera moves slowly out of the room and up toward it. He is engrossed in meditation, gently smoking a cigar, swirls of cigar smoke slowly circling up, as he thinks. Then the dialogue begins. Great.
