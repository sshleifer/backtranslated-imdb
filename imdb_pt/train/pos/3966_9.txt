JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who started working with the agency before being called the FBI, and the story involves dealing with the Ku Klux Klan, the Prohibition-era bandits, German and Japanese spies of World War II, and so on. years of history; far superior to any movies that are made these days. <br /> <br /> Of particular interest to older viewers familiar with Washington, DC. In a 20-minute scene in the movie - where James Stewart learns from Vera Miles that she's expecting her first child - the scene was filmed at Herzog's Seafood Restaurant on the former waterfront of Washington, the only movie in which this historic location appears. Shortly after taking office, President Kennedy decided that Southwest Washington, a 99% black neighborhood, was a monstrosity and should be demolished. By decree commensurate with its indisputable royalty position, the entire area, including the popular seaside restaurant district, but excluding 3 historic churches; was reduced to rubble. Black residents evicted from their homes relocated in the best possible manner and without federal assistance; In the same way, the companies were simply turned off, few moving. Restaurant Row was converted into sidewalk, and Washington had no waterfront (restaurants, seafood stalls, boats, etc) for about 10 years. As a resident of life, the Herzog restaurant scene was our # 1 reason to see this good movie again.
