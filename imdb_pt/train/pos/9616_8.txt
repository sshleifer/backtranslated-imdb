Worth watching twice because of the rapid causal changes among several compelling stories, "Bug" comes as a totally satisfying work of art that plays love always optimistic against a myriad of frustrating reality examples. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch), whose prime concern for life - from cockroach to airline passengers for which he is partially responsible - frames the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable TV technician with unlimited confidence in lucky cookie messages: "You'll meet the girl of your dreams." <br /> <br /> Against this optimism are the forces of peculiar reality, all generated by the actions of the characters: parking tickets, a drain clogged in a Chinese food shop / donut, TV break, a self-crushed fender, an obliterated dinner reservation that eventually results in cancellation of Hawaiian vacations. The movie is funny: Olive getting drunk on a performance by Chippendale, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service rep trying to deal with an angry customer, Cyr (Brian Cox) facing an inspector restaurant, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) reacting to his girlfriend refuses to have children writing hostile fortunes of Chinese biscuits: "Your girlfriend is lying to you" and the guy who falls asleep while working with a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for the missing cat of your girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Minor story with public cabl The introducer of access (Darryl Hisse) and a local interpretation teacher who reads "The Boy in the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" has a lot of fun on the same level as "trains, planes and cars", but with a lower budget and a fresher look.
