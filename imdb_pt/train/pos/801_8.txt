I suppose JEDI is now chronologically considered to be the "last" entry into the popular saga, and it is very good, as are several of them. I liked how this sequel took off shortly after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I enjoyed the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (as well as Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they were not so bad. I liked the thrilling chase in the woods, and I felt there was a lot of good emotion in this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I presume?) Successfully weave all 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy tale. I know that many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes he made in the original movies, but being a novice relative to those films a little late and not missing what I did not already know, I think he made those 6 movies function as an entire entity. Oh, and, erre - Carrie Fisher looked very delicious in her tiny clothes.
