I can not say that this movie is a disappointment because I read some reviews before watching and it did not do as well as I thought it would. The bar was not that loud so the fact that my expectations were met is not saying much. <br /> <br /> The Good: The city of New York. If you live in the city like me, you will recognize certain places and you will understand that the city should be more than just a setting, but one of the main characters. There are genuinely tender moments, funny conversations, and twists on the left and right that keep everything interesting. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in a positive "let them wanting more" fashion. Of course, good skits outweigh the bad ones, but there are a lot of skits that fall into the "in" category, many, in fact, that ultimately knock the film down. In addition, the diversity of New York City, though insinuated in many distant pots of the city and mentioned in conversations throughout the film, is never really realized or analyzed to the point of justice to the city. For example, many of the skits involve well-doing middle-aged whites. I mean, I know the city is home to many of the demographics, but come on, the plot and diversity of Paris Je'taime characters make New York City look like Lancaster, PA, or some really white place. It is simply disappointing to see the city as your heritage. <br /> <br /> Even so, even after having said that, I would recommend the New York vision, I love you. Who knows, maybe you disagree with my opinion and maybe not. You'll never know until you see it for yourself. This review does not intend to dissuade anyone from watching this film, since everyone's opinion on art is different. I'm just giving you a vague idea of ​​what to expect.
