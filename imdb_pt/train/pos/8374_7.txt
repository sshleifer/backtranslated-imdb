Okay, this movie was cool. I do not think it was the best movie ever, but it sure was fun. My brother and I still play scenes from time to time, and occasionally we take the film out of the closet, blow the dust out and put it on. Nice all the way to the end, but a great concept. This is a film that we must forget the criticism and enjoy. The trial is the victory of Robot Jox.
