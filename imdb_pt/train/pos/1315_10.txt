I've seen this movie more than several times on TV. I always watch again ... NEVER turning on the channel. This movie is full of scary surprises, and absolutely point-of-suspense, without being arrogant or stupid. The talent of Helen Hunt is magnificently shown in this movie! I recommend this movie to anyone!
