I found out about the movie "Holes" by hearing from people who were not typical of Disney, that both kids and adults went down in history. Guys, let me say that I was not disappointed. "Holes" is based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is sent to a strange juvenile detention camp in the desert. He befriends a boy nicknamed Zero and together they go on an adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting story, unique, different and funny. I was not sure what to expect when I watched. It was interesting to see the story coming together as pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and Jon Voight was hilarious like you. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!
