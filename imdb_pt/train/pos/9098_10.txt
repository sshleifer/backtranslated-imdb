Domestic Import was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was funny on so many levels, from crazy clothes to hilarious situations. The performance was great. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and all the others did a great job. Because it is an independent film written by a novice writer, he does not have the expected cliches of other comedies, which was a great relief. It was something unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the cheering story. Did I hear it was based on a true story? If so, then this is hilarious (and amazing!). I recommend this movie.
