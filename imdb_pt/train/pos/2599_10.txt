Having so thoroughly enjoyed Joyce's complex romance, I was prepared to be disappointed with the script of Joseph Strick and Fred Haines, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film turned out to be very well done and a good translation of the tone, naturalism and levity of the book. <br /> <br /> It certainly helps to read the original text before watching the movie. I imagine the latter seems disjointed, with very strange episodes apparently randomly sewn, without a prior reading of the text to help understand the plot. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see how dirty the movie is. since it was filmed in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film censors only finally released him to general audience in Ireland in 2000 (it was shown to restrict the audience at a private film club, the Irish Film Theater, in later years 1970). Joyce's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and daring, it offers many "perverse" episodes. It does not matter that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922 - they were still totally taboo when the film was made in 1967. It is amazing and heartwarming to see the cream of the movie. The Irish actor profession of the 1960s, he respected all actors, daring to utter and stage Joyce's highly transgressive text with such enthusiasm. Bravo!
