Jim McKay made one of the best movies you'll see all year long. The silent simplicity of this film attracts you from the opening photo and never lets go. There is not a fake note throughout the film. Not everything. Everything works. The handheld never distracts and is always where it should be. The three young women whose lives we follow are always real. There is not a single beat in which the public is reminded that we are looking at the actresses who play a part. only real girls trying to find each other. There is no political agenda, hidden or not. This is cinema at its most basic, and although it is probably only seen by a handful of movie goers, it deserves a much wider release. Hugh Hefner gave a special hat to give the filmmakers the money needed to make this important film. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay will do next.
