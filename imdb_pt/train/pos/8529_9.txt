I ran through this movie on tv and could not turn it off. Peter Sellers plays a nasty guy who falls in love with an extremely warm and cute Goldie Hawn (who would not do that?). The way the character of Goldie remains from the beginning of the film to the end is unorthodox to this day. This film gave me a different angle in human relations and also found it very funny. The role of Peter Sellers was hard to sell, but I think he does well.
