Ah, true memories. I lived in Holland at the time and looked anxiously at him every Sunday night and then on Tuesdays. I saw it during my 14-16s. Very good for my (at that time school) English, since Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages, except for children's shows nowadays. Then you would hear the original voices and language. - The best series were the first three and after the third series, the great Nazi character Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (I think they never got him, he always escaped the series). , leaving room for him to appear again in a next story) because of course the series was also distributed to Germany, and a Nazi enemy would not do very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful and convincing job of portraying the clever Nazi aristocrat who had this continuing obsession with revenge on England. It was such a delight to see such high-quality performance in a number of young people, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal. They were very believable to me at the time and as a child I could imagine being part of these young people, who at the time were about four years older than me. It was a very exciting series for me, standing out in the memory of those times as a special show with the "Prisoner" as well. I hope they release a good quality DVD of the series, that would be wonderful. Even the bad prints around are still nice to watch. The later series were not as good, diluted, or as fun as the first three. I hope they also find the other series with Von Gelb to be put on DVD. Greetings from Canada.
