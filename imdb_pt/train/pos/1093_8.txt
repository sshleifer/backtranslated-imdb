I always like this movie when it shows up on TV. <br /> <br /> The only scene that always stands out for me is the one with Myrna Loy and the foreman of the painters, where she gives you lots of explicit instructions about the colors and as soon as it goes away he turns the faces of him and says "You understood that, which is yellow, blue, green and white"
