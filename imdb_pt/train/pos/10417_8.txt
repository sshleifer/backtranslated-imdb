"The Baghdad thief" is impressive in the form of the evil magician Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). He plots with lies and spells to get the kingdom of his rightful ruler the young king Ahmad, and a beautiful princess of his father ... <br /> <br /> He is a victim in the end, as do all tyrants (in books and legends) to love and the common man he ignored, here incarnated by the little thief (Sabu). <br /> <br /> The armies of good and evil, black and white, are superbly accomplished in both visual and literary terms ... <br /> <br /> The script is poetic, simple and very beautiful. The magician's costume and his men ascending and descending like wings of black birds, suddenly attacking at night to inflict destruction and create terror ... <br /> <br /> The radiant hero wears white turbans and robes, and your princess is dressed in pale pinks and blues ... <br /> <br /> For spectacular scenes It combined everything that had happened before, while, through the use of color, brought to life a world that did not seem possible before. With flying saucer and flying white horse, with a giant genius (excellently played by Rex Ingram), with evil wizards and with the good performance of Sabu and Veidt, "The Thief of Baghdad" captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Thousand and One Nights ... <br /> The 1940s version continues to be the best fairy tale of the screen!
