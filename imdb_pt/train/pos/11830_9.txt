This is an amazing movie with the whole thing done in only six or seven colors. When he left for over 15 years, he surprised the audience with your color scheme, and so unlike anything else that had been placed in the cinema. These colors, at least for me, make this film absolutely fascinating to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes that I would like to freeze and somehow convert them into a painting to study for their works of art. <br /> <br /> The characters and the story does not match the grandeur of photography, but they are all exaggerated, especially the villains. Famous actors who played them here must have had a lot of fun on set playing "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips," "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley is good as Dick Tracey and his girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she is so sweet and smooth as its name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the young delinquent Dick and Tess are under their wings. Other colorful characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madonna and other names you know, but they are too numerous to list here. Check out the full credits on the homepage and you will be amazed. <br /> <br /> The only negatives I found were the voice of Pacino, who snores at you after a while, the off-key voice of Madonna and the fact that the movie was best trimmed in 10 minutes. These "flaws" are all minor because, in general, this is a fun movie ... a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly colorful way ... like nothing you've ever seen.
