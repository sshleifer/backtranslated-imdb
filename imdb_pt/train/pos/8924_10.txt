This movie is wonderful. What separates it from the other 50's is the fact that the alien has no features, no face, no eyes, or nothing, but can not be killed. I especially like the idea that this movie will not happen in a few days, it happens on a night, lasting, supposedly after midnight. It's also scary that once the bubble hits you, you can not take it off. you are trapped in it as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body. My all-time science-fiction movie is the 50th favorite, and what is sometimes considered the quintessential. I can see why this triggered Steve McQueen to stardom. All this and a captivating theme song! How can you go wrong?
