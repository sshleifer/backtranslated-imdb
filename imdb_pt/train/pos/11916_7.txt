With all the "adult" insinuations in today's family movies it is good to see one where you do not have to worry about it and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids. Yes, this movie may have some swearing (there are those times when Knox swears, but they do not allow you to hear the full words), but for the most part this movie is really as clean as they come (and that includes movies back in day). Not only that, it's very enjoyable, one of my favorites, and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this movie is that it is very short and I wish there were some more of the memorable parts that are in it, I will not mention them because I do not want any spoilers on here. <br /> <br /> All well done and a great movie to watch; so go out and get the kids, make some cookies and watch this movie!
