You probably think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it. But if by chance you watch a second and third and fourth and fifth time (I'm already in the hundreds), you'll find yourself spitting a line from him here and there and busting! My friends and I actually played Fear of the Black Hat Parties to get more of our friends, "as they say, down with the riots."
