When I was a kid, I totally loved Bill & Ted Movies. The other night, Bogus Journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since the last time I saw it, I decided to tune it. And I loved it all again! This movie is still funny after all these years. 'Excellent Adventure' is better, but this is the same thing. Of course, some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy, but hey, this whole movie is tacky in a cool way. It also features the coolest epitome of Death of All Time in a movie! Concluding: Totally like non-fake movie face! Great way! STATION!!!
