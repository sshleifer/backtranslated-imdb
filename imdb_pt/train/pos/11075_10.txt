After reading the comments for this movie, I understandably started to watch it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that would really be good. However, this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Most of the reviews I had read, said the complicated plot made it very difficult to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the end ties so many loose ends that you feel like kicking because you lost so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch" in the sense that it's not so funny (it's actually very dark), and it's much smarter, the way you see parts of scenes from different points (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in an elevator arguing with himself). The way it's similar to the two films I just mentioned, is that it's full of memorable characters, specifically Statham, who gives a fantastic performance as the leader, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the film on Speedos, but gives a great performance, however. If you have time, and then have time to think about the movie, and even watch it again, you really get to see all the symbolism and tips that are presented through the film. I think it's fantastic and Guy Ritchie is a director at the top of his game.
