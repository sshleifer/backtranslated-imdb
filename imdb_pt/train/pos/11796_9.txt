Just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 1980 movie two pieces made for TV. But the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of Rev. Jim Jones, who built a church in a virtual empire, and then encouraged her to disintegrate into a despicable cult in which a congressman and his entourage were murdered, and 917 followers of cult committed suicide by drinking Kool-Aid dipped in cyanide. <br /> <br /> Tightly but horrifyingly made, unlike the CULT OF DAMNED, TRAGEDY of GUYANA has a cast of stars including Ned Beatty (such as Rep. Leo Ryan), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. But it's Powers Boothe (in his first major role) who really stands out as Jim Jones. He really becomes the man, and his performance is fascinating and creepy. So, it's no wonder that this movie still catches attention after more than twenty years.
