Many sources routinely prepare this intriguing drama, partly based on historical facts, along with the superficially similar "nunsploitation" that was one of the pillars of the European trash cinema of the 1970s, ignoring the just rage that drives the whole effort. Perhaps coincidentally it was also the singular attempt of director Gianfranco Mingozzi to make cinematographic narratives out of many well received documentaries. <br /> <br /> FLAVIA safely maps within a historical context the growing rebellion of an Italian nun of the early fifteenth century. (Florinda Bolkan's career performance, even surpassing her excellent work on Lucio Fulci's devastating DON TORTURE A DUCKLING), locked in the convent by her not-so-noble father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl's sensual nature. Wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles in life, as in the holy scriptures, it is confronted by ways in which male domination can break the female life, inspiring revolt fueled by the speech of the older half-sister Agatha (indelibly portrayed by veteran actress Maria Casarès de LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS, by Marcel Carné) and - more constructively - by a Muslim invasion. Joining the oppressors and perhaps involuntarily manipulating them to make her bid, Flavia really becomes the pariah who has already felt, with expected tragic results. With his breathtaking widescreen compositions by Alfio Contini, who shot Antonini's Michelangelo PONTO DE ZABRISKIE, this is an uncompromising and austere account of the ferocious, if ultimately futile, struggle of a woman against the patriarchal society who did not assign her any rights beyond pregnancy or prostitution, as Sister Agatha ironically notes. A long drug-induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on Ken Russell's otherwise extravagant DEVILS, the film turns out to be relatively petty in the skin department, making a kind of mockery of its semi-porn reputation. This is serious work that merits rediscovery and restoration of its unfairly stained reputation.
