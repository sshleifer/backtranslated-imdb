VIVAH in my opinion is the best film of 2006, coming from a director who has proven successful throughout his career. I'm not very interested in romantic movies nowadays, because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. However, I've watched this movie three times now ... and believe me, it's an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional route, displaying simple characters in a sensible and realistic story of the journey between them. engagement and marriage. The film entertains in every way, because it can be reflected in what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya did his homework well and described a very realistic story in a highly successful film. Several sequences in this movie capture his interest immediately: When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of your family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when he comes to see her - that is, a shy Shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about, but pulling on a decent conversation. Also the naive nature of Amrita, limited eye contact, shy features and responding gently to Shahid's questions. The emotional collapse of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when she feeds him on Shahid's party in the form of another's daughter-in-law instead of her uncle's dear niece. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the film belongs to Amrita Rao all the way. The actress portrays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you can not imagine anyone replacing it. She is beautiful throughout the film, and plays an innocent and timid traditional girl perfectly. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor presents himself brilliantly as well. He offers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R. Barjatya movie. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a cute pair on the screen, beyond a shadow of a doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very good). <br /> <br /> Overall, VIVAH delivers what it promised, a well-made and realistic story of two families. The film has high-level performances, great story and good music to suit the film, as well as being directed by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. Must see!
