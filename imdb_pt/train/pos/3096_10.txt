Six degrees left me hooked. I looked forward to it approaching and was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replaced it's time spot. I thought I was just on hiatus and would be back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends were really surprised by the ending. We could relate to characters who had real problems. We talked about each episode and we had our favorite characters. There was no one on the show that I did not like and I felt that acting was superb. I always enjoy watching programs being recorded in cities where you can identify the local areas. I would at least like to protest against the cancellation of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance. Give him a good schedule, do not move him from this day to that day and announce so people know he's on.
