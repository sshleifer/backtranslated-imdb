This is by far the most amazing movie I have seen in a long time. The actors gave wonderful portraits of the characters in the film. The story was accurately portrayed. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by steamboat to Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and he did not. He thinks she's ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging. She encourages you to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. The film accurately portrays your life and a bit of the history of the LDS Church at the same time. It was graphic at times, but it was necessary. The emotional expression was very convincing, which caused my emotions to spread. The filming was fantastic. The way the story was presented was touching. After the movie ended, we stayed there without being able to move. I was shocked. To people who know very little Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, I would encourage you to see this. If nothing else but gain some understanding of your life. For those who are members of the Church, I would encourage you to see them. This will increase your testimony of this incredible man. This is a must see.
