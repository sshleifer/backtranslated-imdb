I admit I have a weakness for alternate story histories, from ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE to GROUNDHOG DAY until 12:01. Among these great is this little gem. It is very difficult to pass MR. DESTINY without giving a nod of thanks to all cast members, from the kindly James Belushi to the murderer Courtney Cox. This film does not have the gravity and scale to make it a great movie, but it's a good mood on a rainy afternoon . It is also a great rental for a cheap date.
