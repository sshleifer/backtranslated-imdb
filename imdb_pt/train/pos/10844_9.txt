This reminded me of Spinal Tap on a more serious level. It's the story of a band doing a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious between them. I was especially impressed by Bill Nighy's performance as Ray. You felt sorry for him, but he had a certain strangeness about him. It's a great movie to watch, if you've ever seen your favorite band get wrinkled, old and pathetic.Bittersweet, highly recommended ..
