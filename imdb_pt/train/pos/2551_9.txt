This almost unknown gem was based on a French farce - which shows, and I mean this as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is being courted by a wealthy Argentine (Roland), who asks for her father's hand in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who has just arrived by plane and launches immediately to reminisce to the public about the last time Caroline decided she was in love with someone else: a dilettante sculptor (Gardiner). The film shows the story of Anthony's strategy of separating Caroline from his sculptor, and how that experience helps him with his Argentine. <br /> <br /> It is perfectly cast: Ronald Colman is the most sophisticated and charming of him, Reginald Gardiner is more noble, Gilbert Roland is the most exotic and Anna Lee is deliciously extravagant. The film is beautifully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced it); The whole production seems like a labor of love. There are wonderful touches such as Colman's breaking frame and camera addressing, and the exceptional use of a sliding bar closet door. It's a sin that has not been released on DVD - this is the kind of movie that alone can spark interest in the classic movie.
