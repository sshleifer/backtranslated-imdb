Yes, Shakespeare would have been proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at his best, but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh, on the other hand, was brilliant. His intrigue was wonderful, as was his play with the public. Very good job. <br /> <br /> There was sometimes very little drama where more would be expected. Cassio's murder, for example, was a little clouded by much happening, causing the viewer to twist his head to understand everything. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His madness struck Roderigo was unusual; even irritating. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Othello before, check this out. If you have not read Othello, look at this. If you have not heard Othello, look at this. You, on the other hand, do yourself a favor by reading it, seeing him acting onstage and listening to him sing too.
