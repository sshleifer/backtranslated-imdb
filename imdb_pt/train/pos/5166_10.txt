Indian Summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I found it funny, moving, and I loved it! Anyone who went camping as a kid and wishes they could sometimes go back to Ole's "good days" briefly, really need to see that one! It starts 20 years later, a group of former campers return to a "meeting." I will not comment further on the plot because you have to see for yourself. The actors were great, and it contains a cast of stars. Everyone played a fantastic role. You really felt like you were a part of the movie watching. Alan Arkin was especially good in his role as Uncle Lou. He interprets the kind of face everyone wants to have in their lives. This is also a good family movie for the most part. I would suggest this to anyone in the blink of an eye! Highly recommended!
