As I've noted with many IMDb reviews, certain critics seem to demand that all the films they see have smugly clever plots that attract their own cleverness. I'm not one of those people. If I watch an action movie, I want to see explosions, gunfire, and heroism. If I watch a comedy, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You got the idea. So watch a horror movie, I mainly want to be afraid. The Grudge is a very scary movie, in both well-executed 'jump' scenes, and it's a creepy image. I've been a fan of horror movies for many years, and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argento, instead of directors of some of the horror movies for teenagers on the mat that are produced today. If you want to be afraid, watch this movie. Much more scary than the original Japanese 'Ring' (which I also think is a great movie).
