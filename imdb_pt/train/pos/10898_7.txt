This movie is not as bad as I've heard. It was nice, funny and I love that it revolves around the holiday season. It totally leaves me in the mood for Christmas shop and listen to holiday music. When this movie comes out on DVD, it will take the place of Christmas Holidays in my collection. It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving, to leave me in the mood for the best time of year. I've heard that Ben's character was a little crazy, but I think this only adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time. Take for what it is, a Christmas comedy with a touch of love. I liked. No, it's not the Titanic and it will not make your heart beat in anticipation, but it will bring a laugh or two. So go laugh and have fun :)
