From time to time this movie is released that no one has ever heard of and was shot in a short time with very little money and resources but everyone goes crazy and ends up being surprisingly great. This also happened in the 1950s with some small movies that many people have never heard of. There are actually some amazing and amazing little gems from the 50's that are worth digging. "Panic in the Streets" is another such movie that comes to mind. Both are movies that are not like the usual movies of your time and are also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised how much I ended up enjoying this movie. It was actually a movie that got better and better as it progressed. Like all "old" movies, it tends to start a bit slow, but once you enter the story and your characters are a real treat with this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great story this involves espionage, although the film does not start like this. It starts out like this typical crime thriller with a touch of film-noir. But "Pickup on South Street" is simply not really a movie by the numbers, so it begins to take its own directions soon after. This ensures that the film remains astonishing, but above all also very refreshing to watch. <br /> <br /> I also really liked the characters inside this movie. None of them are really good and all their faults and weaknesses. Really human. He also plays especially well with Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-deserved Oscar nomination. It really came to be one of the biggest female roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Even despite its rather obvious low budget, this is simply a great, special, little special movie that deserves to be seen by more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
