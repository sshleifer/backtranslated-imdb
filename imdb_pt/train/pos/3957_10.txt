The Three Stooges have always been some of the many actors that I loved. I love almost all the shorts they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses that many of them were in many of the shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the most entertaining comedy team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Husbands Caution! All appearing in this short are the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many funny parts here. This is a very hilarious short. There are another similar Three Stooges short as this called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!
