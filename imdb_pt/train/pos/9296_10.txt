I love this movie. It's crazy, funny, violent, surreal, played on a madman's head, and it's definitely not your usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If you do not find the movie entertaining, I think it's not just for your liking, so it's hard to write a review. <br /> <br /> For reference, some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Promised Princess, and Zoolander (the one that only got me the second time). There are others, but my taste is definitely unusual, and I'm willing to accept that most people just do not like that sort of thing. I do not apologize for having an unusual sense of humor - at least I have one. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters in this particular film are well put together, the verbal humor is hilarious, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as you would expect from the cast), although the demands of interpretation made by the script are not particularly high. The overall package is fun entertainment, fun and fun.
