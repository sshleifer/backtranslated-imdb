For me, this was more of a warning, and the realization that most of what we see, hear, read, and think about almost everything depends on what the media feeds us. This is a classic example of high-level doctors trying to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people with a constitution who bought freely will not be influenced by this media control or by any attempt at misinformation. Again, this shows that, in the end, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. It is also enlightening to see that in a country where there is no religious civil war, this democracy is not a really difficult thing to implement.
