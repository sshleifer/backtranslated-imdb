It leaves the left field and REALLY is not what you are expecting. But I love it. The most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised, if you ask me. If you have not been warned about the mysterious "thing" that makes these brothers so strange ... you're ready for a treat. <br /> <br /> The cast is fantastic, but it does not extend so much that it is palpable. The special effects come out of nowhere (seriously, it's like a strangely somber romantic comedy until they do - so WOW) and they're great. General cinematography is easy on the eyes, editing and sound are of very good quality, and the distorted story unfolds without clich√©s. While none of these aspects is a box office hit, "what the heck?" The ALONE factor makes it a cinematographic treasure. <br /> <br /> People who criticize this movie make no sense. It's one of those often overlooked movies of the 90's that you've never heard of, or that you love so much that you jump at the mention of the title. <br /> <br /> I'm in the last group.
