The film is exceptional in its gay iconography and extends it beyond the asm√©ticos for the music and cast. Throughout the film there is a childlike wonder, seen through the eyes of the main character. Its lightness about the world around us is comical and beautiful. In a way, it's a lazier film for girls. Watch this is that you like a relaxing movie in the middle of the night. Buy this if you like different takes on the world of media and love combined (?).
