Shrek, anyone? Well, imagine Shrek in the Ice Age. Remember the end of Shrek? Of cause you do. Now imagine that Shrek turns into a human, and so does the princess. Take it? Good animation, in fact, much more of an art work than the pictures of Pixar and Disney, who are trying to get as close to reality in their drawings as possible. Strong reviews, some social commentary that children will not understand, the good ones win. One more thing: Scrat. By the way, how does everyone know that your name is Scrat? 7/10
