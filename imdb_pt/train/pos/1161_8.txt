It was extremely low budget (some footage looks like they recorded with a home video recorder). However, it has a good plot line and is easy to follow. 8 years after firing her sexually abusive sexual stepfather, Amanda is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor, with whom she is secretly having an affair. The doctor ends up renting a house and buying a car for her. But in the first 20 minutes of the movie, Amanda kills him and buries him in his backyard. Then she sees her neighbor, Richard, gazes at him and stops at nothing until she has him. She acts innocent, but after another neighbor Buzz discovers that Amanda has killed the doctor and tried to kill Richards' wife, Laurie (that's after Amanda and he put him in the hot tub). Then she stops acting innocently and kills Buzz and later tries to kill Richard, whom she supposedly loves and cares for. And you'll have to rent the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. Overall good movie, reminds me a lot of my life you know the whole falling to the neighbor and stopping at nothing until you are part of it.
