The first 50 minutes of this movie were very annoying. He focused on Doyle's personal problems, including his sick wife, death threats from fans, an insistent publisher, and guilty feelings for his mentally ill father. Even though these matters had a major impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were great. We finally got a look inside Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The sites are good especially for a TV movie and the camera work is good. If the first 50 minutes were as good as the last 40 minutes, it would have been a small masterpiece.
