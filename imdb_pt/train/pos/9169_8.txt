I was very fond of Timothy Dalton, though he was a little too young and too handsome for Mr. A., but I thought Zelah Clarke was too chubby and low. This version, however, was very faithful to the novel and beautifully filmed. I've seen 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr. R, although George C Scott did very well and it was a dispute between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although both were a bit too old for the part. I recently saw a brilliant version of Rebecca on TV with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I would love to see these two doing Jane Eyre. When I got to see the Ciarin Hinds version, I think it was Jane Eyred, but I will never tire of those first few minutes listening to Joan Fontaine's voice narrate the opening of the first version I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
