WHO HAS GOLD? is (sadly) the last of the films HAZZO THE RAZOR, starring Shintaro Katsu as the title character - the proficient multi-weapon, official samurai-authority with the "unique" technique of raping confessions of inattentive informants until they " "The beans" and beg for more ... "This entry begins with Hanzo" discovering "a woman who presents herself as a ghost to protect a lake full of bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the Treasury. This leads Hanzo to discover a scheme of snitching and an orgy ring run by a blind monk. Necessary fencing and rape / interrogation happen - ending in a decent ending to this bizarre movie trilogy. <br /> <br /> Not as strong and nice as THE SNARE (part 2 of the series ...), but still great for fans of sleaze and Japanese samurai movies. 8/10
