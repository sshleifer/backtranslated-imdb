The spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the viewpoint of a wild horse and Native Americans. The film focuses on the friendships and dangers that a wild horse, Spirit, encounters during his lifetime. <br /> <br /> Very well done in the presentation, using the technology available today to provide stunning visuals that are breathtaking in depth. and realism. <br /> <br /> The song is fantastic with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music of Disney's 1994 hit The Lion King. > The story is not very deep, but the fact that it's not as deep as some movies, in my opinion, does not hurt the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Excellent film that I enjoyed immensely, and that is suitable for the whole family. Not to be missed. (10/10)
