I had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book, "I Can not Find My Way Home," which is filled with information about the drug culture in America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff !! I found him an excellent spokesman for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed watching the movie clips of the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. Whoever compiled it was definitely in touch with the songs of each era. I hope they pack them up and sell them like a CD. I would recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960s experiences with LSD have forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow"), which was reportedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine entering the country in the 1960s and 1980s.
