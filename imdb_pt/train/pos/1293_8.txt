This is an excellent film about the solitude of the single man. Phillipe Harel as Notre Heros is somewhat like an amalgamation of Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver, Inspector Clouseau (in his stoicism) and Chauncey Gardiner in Being There (also Peter Sellers). He is single but has no idea how to attract the opposite sex - in fact, he really does not make any effort! <br /> <br /> He has a stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of reaching a couple. - his friend Jose Garcia as Tisserand is in the same situation, but at least he makes a brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood (he is 28 years old and admits that he has never had sex). <br /> <br /> Very good outdoor photos of Paris and Rouen, where the two software people travel on business. They try various nightclubs and places, but all to no avail. My theory is that they are trying in the wrong places - they go to more or less "young" clubs; they should try the kind that has older people, more of the same age. Harel gets increasingly isolated and makes a little effort from Niro, as in Taxi Driver, asking his friend / colleague to go and stab some guys who pulled a pretty girl into the nightclub. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
