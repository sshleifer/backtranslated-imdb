I was impressed by Chavez's position against globalization for some time, but it was only when I saw the movie at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival that I realized what he really got. This film tells the story of the coup / conspiracy of Venezuela's elite, oil companies and corrupt Western governments to remove the democratically elected President Chavez and return Venezuela to a brutal dictatorship. This film is mandatory for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson to the rest of the world! I congratulate the people of Venezuela for taking matters into their own hands and saving their country from the interests of Halliburton and the Bush regime.
