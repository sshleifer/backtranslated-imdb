I like Ralph Bakshi movies ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underrated "Lord of the Rings") and am a collector and fan of Frank Frazetta. I am also a fan of sword and witchcraft who loves the worlds of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the theatrical release of "Fire and Ice" in 1983 and was eager to see it on video or some revival ever since. So the 2005 release was a dream come true for me. However, I bought it with some apprehension because I hoped it was not worth watching it once and then putting it on the shelf as collectible collectible dust until the day I died. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded and I was pleasantly impressed with this movie. Like in Frazetta's art, this is a film that has a physicality and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy and sword movies and witchcraft. without being tacky or dirty. The art is good and you see glimpses of Frazetta at its best. Even my young boys loved watching me and asking to watch again and again. However, my wife has some objections due to the half-naked princess (very Frazetta-esquire). I do not care about this because it is believable and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> There is a broken scope used, but personally I like rotoscopies. It gives more fluid and realistic moves to characters that are difficult to find in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuity issues, I recommend this movie to all fans of Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan and Sword and Witchcraft. Appreciate!
