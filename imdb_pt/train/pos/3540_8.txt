I bought this game on a walmart impulse purchase. I'm glad I did. It was so much fun listening to Sean Connery and playing the game. I thought the graphics were the best I've seen in a movie / game remake. The bonus levels were very difficult! The sniper I think was very difficult, made me so frustrated I did not play the game for a week and a half. There were many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to deal with. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the update system. I did not notice any difference from equipment not upgraded to the updated one, as buying an armature upgrade does not seem to make the armor stronger or more filling in my life meter. I really liked the Q helicopter. I think the developers did a good job.
