When I went to The Shining for the first time I was expecting a decent movie from what I had heard and I really enjoyed Stanley Kubrick's other work, but when I started watching it, it was so much better than I thought. Sometimes I felt seriously ridiculously restless and I could not take my eyes off the screen yet there is something very disturbing about everything in the movie. Now, some people do not like Kubrick's version of The Shining, since it does not follow Stephen King's book entirely, but in my opinion both Kubrick's version and the miniseries and the book are great. Jack Nicholson gives an incredible performance . If you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking, even after the most movies, watch The Shining.
