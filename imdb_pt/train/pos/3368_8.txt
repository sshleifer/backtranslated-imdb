Hitler's visit to Rome is the backdrop to this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six who stays at home while her whole family goes to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay at home since the family can not afford a maid. She would have loved to leave, since she, along with the entire housing complex where she lives, is a fervent admirer of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> There is an exception. Across the courtyard, Marcello Mastroianni is in his chair, thinking of committing suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and because of this he recently lost his job as a radio broadcaster. The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is desperate and desperately in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband, plays Mastroianni and in a masterly, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex, offers her body to him only to be rejected. The initial shock is soon replaced by his hunger for this man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, that other world that is so willing to give her everything she wants. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful work movie with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves here that she is a caliber actress when well directed. This is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, common people and, most importantly, the human condition. Despite its sad ending, there is a glimmer of hope in the end, things will change, someone understood.
