I saw this movie while I was at Birmingham Southern College in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dream quality. Most of the film involves a happy swimming fish in its bowl while its new owner, a little boy, is away at school. A cat walks into the room where the fish and its bowl are and begin to peer cautiously at its "prey." The boy begins his walk home from school, and the viewer wonders if he will arrive in time to save his friend fish. The fish gets agitated by the presence of the cat and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly walks over to the fish, gently grabs it with its paws and takes it back to its bowl. The boy returns happily to his fish, nothing wiser. <br /> <br /> The ending is amazing both in its irony and in its technical complexity. It's hard to imagine how the director could have pulled the technical talent back in 1959 - it seems more like a trick for 2003. If you can find it, watch it - you will not be disappointed! And if you * find *, let me know so I can get a copy too!
