I would not know about this movie were it not for its "surprise" in the Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature. Luckily, it happened that I was able to watch this animated little treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about the child Brendan, who was nephew of the imposing and overprotective Abbot of the county of Kells. The main pre-occupation of the Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day Aiden, the renowned illustrator of Iona, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the attraction of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan made friends with the sprite of the white Aisling forest, as he sought to retrieve an invaluable ancient crystal for the painstaking art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> "The Secret of Kells" is different from most of the animations released. nowadays. It is a kind of reminiscence, since the illustrations are made in geometric lines and austere designs, without much care with the realism, as much with the symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic but fluid style of animation used in the initial sequence of "Kung Fu Panda". However, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of admiration for the public. The reds used in the wake of the Viking invasion are unforgettably scary. <br /> <br /> Try to get this gemstone from a movie. It's a welcome break from all the bombastic nonsense of the current animated fare like "Monsters vs. Aliens" and the like. The meager Celtic soundtrack is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that pervades the film. OK, the story can be a bit shallow and the ending a little needy. I'd like to know more about the book that Brendan and Aiden were working on. But the clear star of this film is clearly his incredible stylized work of art, which is said to be based on the work of art of the true Book of Kells.
