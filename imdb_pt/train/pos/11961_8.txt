I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a very hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a cheerful comedy. The plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are friendly (even the well suspect serial killer bread). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still totally in control of the style that many of us grew to love. <br /> <br /> That was the most I laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I was never impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to soften her sexy image and jumped straight to a young, but spirited woman. <br /> <br /> This may not be the crown jewel. of his career but was smarter than "Devil Wears Prada" and more interesting than "Superman", a great comedy to go see with friends.
