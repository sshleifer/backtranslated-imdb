It takes a while to get accustomed to Nick Nolte's phrases in Nebraskan before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright. After you pass by the bar, it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good. <br /> <br /> Nolte, an American, moves to Germany, marries a famous actress and is a contented success in every respect until the war is about to leave. He is visited by a jovial American, John Goodman, who convinces him to accept a job as an anti-Semitic radio broadcaster for the Nazis. Nolte has no politics, but he thinks it's a challenge to write a role that is almost impossible and then play himself. Another US secret agent will modify Nolte's radio scripts - inserting a cough here, a sneeze there - that will serve as a code for transmitting intelligence to the Allies. There is a problem, though. No one will know about Nolte's real role as an American agent except Goodman, Donovan, and Roosevelt himself. If it is ever discovered, it will be refused recognition by the Americans. <br /> <br /> Nolte plunges into the front and his violent broadcasts are very popular in Germany. His beloved wife, Sheryl Lee, knows nothing of what is happening, nor cares. Nolte and Lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as "a nation of two." The war is over and the problem begins. He is captured by Americans who are bitter because of his betrayal. They beat him up and left him in the mud. He is rescued by Goodman, his "fairy godmother," who sends him to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sends him some money once in a while. <br /> <br /> In 1960, he manages to cultivate a friendship with his family. the neighbor, the painter Alan Arkin, who also lost his family and claims that the two now belong to a secret brotherhood. But its location and identity somehow leaked out and it is more or less adopted by a group of ancient Aryan racists - led by a dentist and a priest. The front of his house and the mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations. He is beaten senseless by a former soldier. But - miraculously - his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient Aryans. Another trick: it turned out later that he is not his wife, but his younger sister who has loved him since adolescence. <br /> <br /> The end is that he has typed his memoirs in an Israeli prison in 1967, before his trial for crimes against humanity. It's not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Nolte can speak, but not see, the occupant of the cell above his prison. It's Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann looks quite nice. He advises Nolte that it is a bad habit to type for fifteen hours in a row. "It's important to relax. You must learn to relax." Nolte laughs loudly and shouts, "That's how I got here." The film is filled with these ironies. At one point in their relaxed conversations, Arkin tells him that "I still think people are good at heart." I do not know if the movie was a commercial success, but if it was not, that's the kind of thing that could have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater goers who may have never heard of Anne Frank, let alone that supposedly final statement in his diary. <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is a movie for adults and adult patients. The story moves slowly, there is very little violence, there are no car chases, no gunshots, and people do not seem to be subject to manic-talking pressure. Most likely you will pass by onlookers who do not open up to your deliberate approach. Nolte refers to the wartime relationship between him and his wife as "a nation of two." This is a very compact sentence. No doubt anyone could come up with a simplistic definition, but it takes a little concentration to understand their emotional importance. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a man who loses everything - his writing ability, his identity, his wife (twice), his only friend, his country, his self-respect. At one point, he stops walking down a crowded New York street and stands there until after dark when taken by a curious cop. The reason he stopped is that he simply has nowhere to go. What Vonnegut is describing is much more than depression. I do not want to appear condescending, but it is the kind of feeling that is difficult to understand in your youth. Teens may like to THINK that they know what Nolte is holding at that point, but that really requires maturity and the accelerated sense of finitude that only maturity can bring. <br /> <br /> Remember Robert Frost's line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you? Well, no place is going to take Nolte.
