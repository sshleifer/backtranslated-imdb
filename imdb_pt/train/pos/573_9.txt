I've always liked movies that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Runs Through It" is the perfect name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life rises and flows like a river, and it has its tough spots, but it's a wonderful trip. <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the film. His narration has a friendly feel that fits perfectly in the picture. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprising well as brothers. I'm not sure how to describe the performances of Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn, except that they really do look real. "A River Runs Through It" is a wonderful film. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
