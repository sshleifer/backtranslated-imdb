To say that a movie is depressing is not necessarily a bad thing. I am very willing to watch a depressing movie if there is a point to be made and this certainly has one. It is the often touching story of a Chinese man and his family as they experience many years of hardship and abundance. BUT, I must warn you that this may be just about the most depressing movie that came out of Hollywood in the 1930s - because peasant life in China was TOUGH, to say the least. Be prepared to watch segments on hunger, death, and disease. <br /> <br /> The only negative aspect other than the lingering tone of misery is that Paul Muni plays the leading role. Although he was an exceptionally talented man, it is a real pity that Hollywood has always pitted people of European descent to play Asian leaders during this time. If you're paying attention to everything, it's pretty obvious that Muni is wrong for the role.
