108: Tarzan and his Companion (1934) - released 20/4/1934, seen on 8/8/08. <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escapes from prison and steals a bank in Iowa. Bonnie and Clyde kill two patrolmen in Texas. BIRTH: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin and Richard Chamberlain. DOUG: After we were a bit disappointed with the original 'Tarzan the Ape Man', we discovered among colleagues and historians that the second film 'Tarzan and his partner' was the best of the series. It is true. I got a big kick in this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the wild superhero of animal dueling, and Maureen O'Sullivan reprises her role as her totally fantastic woman, Jane (who wears a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here). In my review of 'Ape Man', I stepped on Jane very well for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screams, but she redeemed herself for me here. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this film, and Jane is the most capable character in the entire cast. She acts as the ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can work perfectly in the jungle and get on with the animals, and she knows how to hold a furious pride of lions when she is without bullets. She even has her own jungle cry now. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She totally trained him. Cheeta is also charming, taking out Martin's cigarette. The plot is mainly an excuse for Tarzan to fight with the cruelest jungle animals, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. The effects, although always visible, are much more dynamic and cold and complement the action well. Oh, and you can not talk about this movie without talking about the naked swimming scene. All I can say is: yes, she's naked. Very exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just Wow. When it comes to pre-code action / adventure, nothing catches the eye of "Tarzan and his partner." The inevitable continuation of Tarzan, the Monkey Man, is a violent and risky jungle epic. I doubt there is another Tarzan film in the future that does not make prisoners like this does. You would be hard-pressed to find a complete scene in this movie that would be endorsed by the Code, or Animal Rights-approved for that matter. The macabre violence does not even expect the happy couple from the jungle to appear before even pushing the limits of today's adventure films. And after T & J enters the scene, there are many morning breasts and nudity in the afternoon. See for yourself if you do not believe me. I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this movie. In the first film, Jane seemed a walking contradiction, as the writers of the day did not know how to play such a character. But here she is a great precursor to the women of the future cinema. Although she still needs Tarzan's help to get her out of most of the traffic jams, she does much more than just wait to be rescued. His personality is perfectly believable for a woman who lives (relatively) comfortably in the jungle for a year. I watched it with my mom, and I enjoyed showing her how much Jane has Tarzan "trained", as Jeff Foxworthy put it. She totally got the monkey man for her every time beck and call. While there are a number of optical effects dated throughout the film, there are still many breathtaking battles against the predator that are performed (mostly) for real. That and the men dressed in monkeys are much more convincing this time around. ** SPOILER ** The movie climaxes as the jungle explodes with a shocking orgy of violence from the animal kingdom that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two humans still breathing. Although the couple enter the sunset gathered and victorious, I can not help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous group of humans who were to find Tarzan and Jane and never again were heard. . ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that still bothers me is the smooth, hairless body of Johnny Weissmuller. Other than that, this is a pre-code of action and adventure that is absolutely a must-see. <br /> <br /> Last film: A Night Has Happened (1934). Next film: 20th century (1934).
