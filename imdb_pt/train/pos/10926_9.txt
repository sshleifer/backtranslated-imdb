If you love kung fu movies and have not seen this movie, you're fooling yourself. This film is one of the only kung-fu braggers that could be recommended for fans of all kinds of movies. Usually, it takes a diehard fan of the genre to see anything in those movies, but this one has it all! The story is well told and complete. The fight scenes are great and tend to end before you're completely bored (unlike the Crouching Tiger). Throw some mystery and torture and you will have a real movie. See this at all costs. Heck, my wife still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du it! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
