I had just come to thirteen when I first saw this series and am watching it again on DVD more than thirty years later. Photos of opening credits never left me. That affected my view of the world and the people in it. My parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me, and we always discussed the show afterwards. This gave me a love of studying history and the highest grades I got on the public exams of our school! <br /> <br /> Sir Laurence Olivier's voice and delivery are timeless and perfect. It seems to me that people who have experienced this would feel that this is their version of the history of World War II. I can not imagine being bored looking at him. Perhaps a similar series of the Cold War can now be contemplated, although it is difficult to imagine who can replace Sir Laurence. <br /> <br /> Buy it!
