I took the last half of this movie on cable one night and was impressed by how morbid it was. Even when one of the two victims is further deteriorated, the camera continues to function. the lengthy photos of his corpse being discovered and his concentration camp figure being enclosed in a body bag are moving and depressing. Do not watch this movie if you are already depressed. then again, do not watch if your feeling is really good.
