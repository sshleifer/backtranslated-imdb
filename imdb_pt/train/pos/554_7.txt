(contains small spoilers) <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Stewart is naturally remembered by many as George Bailey of Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life," so it's easy to find parallels between the two films. In "It's a Wonderful Life," Bailey can see the world as it would have been had he never been born. In "The Far Country," Jeff Webster of Stewart, for not getting involved to help someone (except him), can see essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical matters) does not exist. <br /> <br /> By not getting involved (and trying not to care about anyone), Webster is forced to see those he can not help but get hurt, push and even kill while he does nothing. This reminds the viewer of George Bailey watching a world that turned upside down, because he also decided not to get involved by never being born. <br /> <br /> Both films end with the same image - a close-up of a bell ringing. Turning around his philosophy of non-involvement, Stewart, it seems, gained his "wings".
