I really liked this movie. The acting of the adult actors was great, although I found the main boy a little stiff. But he behaved very well for being a new talent. The mood is very sublime and not in your face like most junkies in Hollywood comedy. In other words, The Mad Professor. If you have little attention span and are accustomed to the typical Hollywood stuff, you probably would not like that because it's a little slower. I got on Blu-ray and I have to say that the picture quality is top notch. Probably one of the most beautiful Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were nice too. They deleted a bit, but that's probably a good thing, since most deleted scenes did not add anything.
