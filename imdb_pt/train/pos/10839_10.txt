I saw this movie in the store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought VHS and enjoyed it ever since. <br /> <br /> The plot was well discussed, so there is no need to review it again. The point is this movie deserves repeated views. Americans, especially, will not get all the jokes the first time around. I know I did not. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray proposes a toast to his daughter's wedding, it is unseemly. When Karen calls Tony "Brian" while he tries to kiss her, it's heart breaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's very funny for words. <br /> <br /> And the music: It's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I was dancing in the living room "All Over the World". <br /> <br /> Each presentation is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was rightly praised for his portrayal of Ray, a man who had many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovely keyboardist who carried a torch for Karen all those years. It has an attractive look that makes women want to hug you. But all the actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore all the trays you've read about this movie and see. It's a gem.
