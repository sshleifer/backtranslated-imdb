I am really outraged by the comment I read, saying that this movie was "boring" and that the beautiful landscape was marked by black and white footage. It was made in 1925 !!!! I find this absolutely incredible for your time! <br /> <br /> The journey these people had to go through is absolutely remarkable. It took a week just to cross a river. The women carried their children in heavy wooden berths on their backs, climbing a solid layer of rock, sometimes bare in the snow. I'd like to see someone do this now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a wonderful movie with some really amazing photos and an incredible story.
