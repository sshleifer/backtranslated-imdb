Gus Van Sant made some great movies. I really am a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can not help but feel that the brain part of Tom Robbins' "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" book is missing in the translation to the big screen. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are visionaries and towers of incredible talent. Ultimately, although this simply did not work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not become alive. It's just that our imagination is much more powerful when you read a book like that. We are taken to a different time and place and sometimes we think the worst and / or the best and this increases the overall roller coaster of the book as it unfolds sharply according to the author's accuracy. Movies, however, can leave one with less imagination and roller coaster excitement, damaging the overall experience. This is what I believe happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
