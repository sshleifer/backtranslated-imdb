Mine Kumari exhibits more style and grace just by moving standing up to sit on the floor than you can find in most other movies. The director produced more memorable scenes of moving beauty than seems possible. Music and dance are of the highest quality possible. You may notice in the first dance scene that the director has all sorts of things going on in the background: another dancing girl, a drunken falling ladder, lots of activity but he knew we would be watching Mina dancing and I bet unless you seen this many times, you did not realize. All in all, perfection.
