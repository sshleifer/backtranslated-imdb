My only complaint with the movie that I grew up knowing how to ESCAPE TO HEAVEN is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty minutes at the scene of the trial. And the judgment itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully scaled up as young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY that gives the most lively and dependable performance. . The French accent MARIUS GORING is a delight (he even makes a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to retrieve Niven when his wartime death is not reported due to carelessness. Goring has some of the most witty lines and delivers them with pleasure. Seeing this tonight at TCM for the first time in about twenty years, I think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year was for 1946 films. Technicolor photography, a little discouraged and nothing fancy, is great and the way it transforms into B & W for the celestial sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is the kind that really appeals. a spectator on the fanciful aspects of the story - and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter as his plane is pounding toward the earth unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Truly a wonderful film from start to finish, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
