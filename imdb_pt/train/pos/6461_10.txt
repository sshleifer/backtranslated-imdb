First I was totally caught off guard by the initial lyricism of the movie and then I became totally enthralled with the unfolding story and got involved with the brilliant direction. The characters were fully developed, no bigger than life, but like the people we live in, anywhere in the world, in Sweden, Turkey or America, all human beings completely believable, with weakness and nobility. Hollywood could learn a lot from this beautiful movie. This shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring the whole theme clear and bright, and this shows the brilliance of the director! Thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this great treatment !!
