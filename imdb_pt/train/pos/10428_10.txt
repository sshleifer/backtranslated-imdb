Incredible movie that, in theory, should be boring, but delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that I have long despaired to find. Instead of relying on overly dramatized cliches and moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect, and so relating to them as people you might know is easy. The film is not trying to pull laughter, or push an ideal audience, but simply showing us the possibility of true love under any circumstances. <br /> <br /> Now I'm restless waiting for the weekend to see the sequel. A moving, thought-provoking, funny look at the love that I think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with Casablanca and breakfast at Tiffany's. It will soften even the hardest heart.
