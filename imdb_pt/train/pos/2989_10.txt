First of all, I would just like to say that I am a big fan of Bette Midler. Stella is a very good film with a wonderful cast (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite movies of all time. He deals with a mother raising a child by herself, she goes through many things that are out of her way to raise her daughter Jenny, played wonderfully by Trini Alvarado. This movie is very good and I suggest you take a copy to watch it. Roger Ebert gave it 3 1/2 stars! And deserved 4! WONDERFUL! I give 4 out of 4!
