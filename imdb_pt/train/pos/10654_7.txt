The Haunting is a film that has a really scary house, good effects of work and sonorous work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around him is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what happened at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely scary moments in the movie and I liked the way ghosts showed up in sheets, curtains, and in the house itself. The score of Jerry Goldsmith gave the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around him. What I would like to have happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to face and I think he held it a little too much. Poltergeist scared me when I saw many years ago, and that still holds. Haunting could have used some more scenes of sheer terror. The end was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are times that make you jump. I just wanted to scare me more.
