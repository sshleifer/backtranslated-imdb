Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, make a trip to Thailand for one last experience before they split up and leave for college. It seems like a fun time to visit an exotic land, until they find an attractive stranger that seduces them to travel to Hong Kong and put drugs in their bags. They are picked up by local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the US. <br /> <br /> This is the main story of the "Brokedown Palace" and it was good. The film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt justice systems of Third World nations. In fact, the portrait was quite light, since the conditions of the prison are much worse than those described. It serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is, it is untouched compared to much of the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many situations planned in the movie. This made history difficult. Every escape attempt was a fake fantasy. To think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a bribe in prison with a padded bra, and not be discovered by the guards who were systematically checking everything that was brought in from the visitors, assuming either the guards or the spectators are utter fools. <br /> <br /> The story also can not close the annoying question of how the drugs arrived in Alice's backpack (Claire Danes). Did she really agree to carry the drugs? We are left to guess. It was intriguing to learn about the girls' innocence throughout the film, but we finished the movie without really knowing if one or both of the girls could be guilty. Except for this considerable failure, the end was excellent and the results unexpected. <br /> <br /> The performance of Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very solid and well made. The Danes, who were exaggerated and exaggerated, actually arrived as actors in this film. Although her portrayal was often immature (as was her character), she improved as the film progressed and circumstances became more terrible. Beckinsale, in contrast, has flown under the radar all her short career and shines like the shoe that suddenly finds herself in prison. Her performance was the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman was miscast as the lawyer. His ironic and suspicious style is a trump card in films like "While You Were Sleeping" but as a lawyer in a third world country in a crusade to free two innocent girls from injustice, he had the wrong personality. <br /> <br /> The look of the tourist in Thailand was interesting, but it did not make me want to go there. In general, a fun movie has become implausible in parts by the insertion of some ridiculous scenes. I gave it a 7/10.
