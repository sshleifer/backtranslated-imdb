I have, "Things to Come" in D.V.D. and it's very clear compared to my VHS version. The audio is fair, but it can be difficult to understand sometimes. <br /> <br /> I liked the film so much that I looked for a copy of the book and found it. He gave details of why some things happened. The best things about the movie are the little things that I did not notice at the beginning. Such as, John Cabal playing with a toy plane at a Christmas party, as if it were a dive bomber, out naming sea power, naming a warship, "Dinosuar." Ships sunk by airpower, an enemy sneak attack not declared by airplanes. Sweep flying wing plans. Strong rolls for women throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There's more, watch the movie to enjoy them.
