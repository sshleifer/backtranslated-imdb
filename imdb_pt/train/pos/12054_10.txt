I saw this movie for the first time here in the UK in December 1989 when the Central TV broadcast. I still have the video tape, though worn (over the years, many friends and family members borrowed it and also were chilled by it!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember coming home that night, getting a Christmas drink, turning off the lights and watching what was heralded as a 'Christmas Ghost Story'. Even now I remember certain scenes that still leave the hairs on my neck standing ... <br /> <br /> I've seen some comments in the movie that say it's not this and not that ... I think these people get scared on Friday the 13th and so on, chase and cut rammel, which are laughable. This is a "traditional" ghost story; no big budget action or special effects ... no swearing, no blood, no free sex scenes, chainsaws or weapons etc ... So refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric. If you like frightful terror, well written, well-represented and with a genuinely scary atmosphere, this is the movie for you. I like the original horrors; just last night I saw the original Haunting and this is a superb movie. Very atmospheric again - and so is the woman in black. The end of the film differs from the book, but it's still very good. I recommend. Try it ... you * will * like it if you like traditional ghost stories ... So ... turn off the lights, raise the fire, lock the doors, have a drink ... and enjoy ... :)
