Why the hell should you explore the hypnotizing documentary about the "Earth" nature? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain it to you? OK, I will not lengthen my review exploration on "Earth" to infinity, but I must argue my reason why this is a "must see." The documentary makes a round trip to the migration trails in three animal families: a female polar bear and her cubs with the paternal bear's real-life subframe challenging him to seek food on his isolated path, a mother of one whale with its baby whale catching a whale from a migration tour to prey, and a mother elephant with its small children (perhaps not so small, they are elephants) migrating in Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill and Mark Linfield have done "off-the-ground" work while also capturing the survival skills of many other species of animals, as well as the magnetic jacks of our three animal family protagonists. The cinematographically skillful team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were animatedly filming the wonderful places of nature and the instinctive behaviors of the animals; not to mention, shots of prey animals were u n b e l e v a b l e. "Earth" is also a learner of lesson on the effect of global warming on animals; the polar bear of the potato in the document is the propaganda boy of this consequence. So comrades Terrans, it's time to make the documentary journey to visit the "Earth" today! **** Good
