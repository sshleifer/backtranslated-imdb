Of course, the story of this movie was "Hollywoodized" - but it is far from the only piece of history rewritten for the masses. Lafitte was on the American side because he considered himself a Frenchman and therefore hated the British, not because of any sense of patriotism from a nation that had recently taken over New Orleans; he broke his agreement and went back to smuggling, which caused his navigation to Galveston; he was more of a petty criminal than a hero or a braggart. But who cares? This is a movie that is pure fun - and, for all intents and purposes, we all wanted Jean to go to the sulky woman instead of the Governor's pudgy daughter. Brynner once again stands on mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance.
