This film is inspiring for anyone who is or is in trouble, financially or emotionally. You'll definitely laugh, that's the best remedy! :) Left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies, Grace needs to find a new way to make money and this is not exactly legal, which adds to the mood. Even my boyfriend liked it, so do not think it's a flick-chick.
