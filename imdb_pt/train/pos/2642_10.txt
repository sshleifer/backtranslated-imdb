In fact, this is a "heart that heats up" movie. He won the George Peobody Award, winning "Roots", so that may say something about the essence of this film. I've been looking on the internet how to order this movie since my ex-father-in-law, Eugene Logan, the co-author of this movie was killed a few years ago, so I no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him. I would love to have your only granddaughters, my daughters, see this movie, as well as pass this wonderful story to your great-grandchildren. My eldest daughter was seven at the time it was aired on television and since then I was eager to see it again. One of my friends said it was his favorite movie. I will not spoil this movie for you.
