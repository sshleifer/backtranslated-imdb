This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The original drum and bass. <br /> <br /> There seems to be very little early. is more than that, nowadays it tends to be of a very different kind from Who altogether, a parody, a shadow of his (much) better years. To be fair, none of them have to prove anything to anyone else, they have earned respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This filming of the show for me is one of the best. To command an audience of about 400,000 people requires skill, charisma, wit and a lot of good music. <br /> <br /> We all know of the other acts in law, The Doors (the last of them). show weeks before Jim Morrison dies), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point is that whoever was there was the one who most had come to see. This show was a year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 60's; Woodstock. The movie and the record were gone and also the biggest work of The Who to this day, Tommy. The hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to "Grove and Love", knowing that this show was their own. To do this, you needed the best that Rock 'n' Roll had to play in the hungry crowd. At two o'clock in the late afternoon of August 1970, M.C. announces, "Ladies and Gentlemen, a small Rock 'n Roll band from Shepherds Bush London, the' OO '. John Entwistle's costume is black leather, in front is the outside line of a human skeleton neck to toe, Roger wore his traditional costume of long long tassel hair and Keith, wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, while Pete wore his white overalls and Doc Martins that he preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> The Who has never stopped their High Energy Rock attack for more than two hours, playing most of them and other artists, such as Young Man Blues, Shaking 'All Over, and then as in the queue, Keith lures the sung to "Shut up, it's a bloody opera" with Tommy, the Rock Opera. The crowd went wild. That's what they had come to hear, and the Who did not disappoint, straight into Overture and never looking for air until the final note of "Tommy, can you hear me?" Amazing. Capturing a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature in its heyday at a Festival that would be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of Film History. <br /> <br /> The DVD in English only comes in a soundtrack of the English / Linear PCM Stereo, it was like in the United States, I think, you can get it with at least 5.1, "Check the local press for Details ??" about this, okay. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a slice of Rock and Festival history, this DVD sends you a nostalgic memory journey as you press the game, for some of the best footage of the Who concert, what it was meant to be, Live, Raw and your face ! <br /> <br /> I would have given this DVD ten if it were not for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been good. <br /> <br /> Thanks Roger, Pete, John and Keith
