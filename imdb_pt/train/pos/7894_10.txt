This is a great show, and it will make you cry, this group of people really loved each other in real life and this shows over and over again. Send me an email and let's talk. I've been to Australia and they really do. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and pass on these great stories of right and wrong, and friendship to your children. I have all 40 DVD-R episodes I've collected over the last 5 years. See my tribute to Five Mile Creek at www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to extended theme music. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
