This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a country hick, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. The best thing is that laughter never stops. The plot is a story of the same age that the child is separated from the mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather played in good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you remember in the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to town to have a decent life and his delivery of dialogues and mannerisms are hilarious. Later in the movie he turns into Angry Young Man, he's famous, but the mood remains. Memorable pieces include his walk, speaking and speaking in English, the music (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadao. <br /> <br /> All in all, I was rolling with laughter throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its absolute best - that's it. Will easily give it a 10/10.
