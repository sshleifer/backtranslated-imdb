Atlantis was much better than I expected. In a way, it had a better story than the other films aimed at a more advanced age. Although this movie required solid attention at times. It was a great movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the younger viewers were expecting a comedy, but they got an affair. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have seen nothing but parodies. After a short period of time, everyone seemed very keenly watching Atlantis.
