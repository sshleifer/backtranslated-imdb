I have to say, Clive Barker's Undying is by far the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and the Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but none of them captured the pure joy with which this game addresses its horrible elements. Barker is good at what he does, which gives the horror to our world, and shows how his hand is clearly everywhere in this game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Filled with lush looks and enough atmosphere to shake a stick, Undying is the game to hit my books as the best title of terror. I just wanted this to have come to a consoles system, but weak PC sales did away with that.
