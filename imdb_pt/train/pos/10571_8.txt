James Cagney is best known for his character roles and gangsters, but he also played very 'soft' characters in his career. This musical is one of them and was the first, but not the last musical film that Cagney would star. <br /> <br /> Cagney is even singing a little on this song and also dancing a lot. And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it. He plays the role with great confidence. He apparently had some dance work early in his career before his acting career began to take off, so it's not really a strange thing that he also took on some musical acting roles in his career. He obviously also feels at ease in this totally different genre than most people are accustomed to seeing it. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who may have been the best and most successful director of the genre. . His early musicals of the 1930s practically defined the musical genre and he was also responsible for genre films such as "42nd Street." His musicals have always been light and fun to watch and more comedy than anything else. The musicals of the '30s were never really about his singing, this was something that popped up in the 1940s and then did musicals, especially at MGM studios. As always, it has a light and simple story, set in the musical world, which, of course, is also predictable and progresses stereotypically. However, it is a fun and simple story that also makes this movie fun to watch. So the characters and actors who are portraying them. In a way, it's strange that the overall plot of the movie is kind of abandoned at the end of the movie, when the movie begins to consist of only routines of musical numbers. <br /> <br /> The musical moments towards the film. The ending of the film is also fun and well done, although I'm not a big fan of the genre itself. Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty. He often played boys / babies / mice and everything else early in his career, including the musical "Gold Diggers of 1933" from a year earlier. <br /> <br /> An initial genre film recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
