I think this movie was one of the good movies of Kurt Russel. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he's a good actor in whatever role he plays. But this movie had a lot of action and I know I should have more than 5.6 out of 10 on the meter, but a lot of people did not like that movie. Oh well, I thought it was good, so I guess everyone should see this movie. If you see this movie and like it, I think you should see the Back Draft also with Kurt Russel. I give Soldier *** 1/2 off *****
