Nina Foch insists that "My Name Is Julia Ross" in this 1945 movie is also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the movie suffers. It could have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I was growing up, Foch was a figure on television, playing a neurotic woman, wife with her traitorous husband, the wreck nervous. She became one of the great theater teachers in Los Angeles. Here she is a very young naive playing the lead role. Julia responds to an announcement from a secretary and is hired immediately by Mme. Hughes and his son Ralph. Little does she know-though we know immediately-that the job agent is a front, created to get the right woman for this job, a woman without a family and no boyfriend. <br /> <br /> in the situation; when Julia comes home, she is drugged, and when she wakes up, she says she is Mrs. Hughes and is not allowed out. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Low budget but still fun - some things, particularly in the end, happen very quickly, which is why I said the film is too short. However, I recommend it.
