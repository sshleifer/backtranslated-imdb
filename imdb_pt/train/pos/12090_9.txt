I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old alone in my parents' basement on a Saturday night. It was being shown at the "Chiller Theater", a regular feature of the scare that I watched religiously as a young man. Now, I have seen many old horror films thanks to the Chiller Theater, but none of them stayed with me as "Danse Macabre", also known as "Castle of Blood". I'm 51 years old now, and last year alone I was fortunate enough to find a relatively recent and quality DVD edition of this wonderfully shaking supernatural classic, having thought I'd never be able to see it again. I've watched it four more times, and I can not seem to get enough of it. <br /> <br /> They do not make scary movies like this anymore. Haunted catacombs and mist-wrapped cemeteries simply do not work as well as black and white in the past. Anyway, this one has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, delightfully obscure, castle-like scenarios haunted by cobwebs, restless spirits reenacting their deaths ... and a perversely ironic ending. IMO, this one is up there with "The Haunting" by Robert Wise, "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr), and the latest "The Others".
