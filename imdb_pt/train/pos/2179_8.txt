The Prix de Beauté was made on the verge of a change from silence to sound, which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally conceived as a silence, it was released with a soundtrack dubbed in France, with a French actress speaking lines by Louise Brooks, but was released as a silence in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was fortunate to see the impeccable and new restoration of the Cineteca di Bologna from a silent Italian impression at the Tribeca Film Festival. I have not seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume that the silent version is much more satisfying, since in all accounts the dubbing is poorly done (Louise Brooks speaks clearly English so there's no way her lips are beyond Prix ​​de Beauté tells his story visually, with an exciting and imaginative camera work.The opening is instantly kinetic, with scenes of life The film's emphasis is on visual details, clothing, machinery, decoration and symbolic images, such as a caged bird, a pile of torn photographs, a diamond bracelet. the silent movie technique at its height. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks, of course, is responsible for saving the film from obscurity. <br /> <br /> Seeing this makes it more painful to think that this was his last protagonist role. Beautifully beautiful, she dominates the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural but highly charged performance. Her role here, more than in Pabst's films for which she is best known, is a woman with whom we can understand and sympathize. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a possessive fiancé, who longs to get more out of life and secretly enter a beauty contest with immediate success. She is then torn between the excitement of her new glamorous life and her love for the man who insists on giving up everything or losing it. All characters are drawn with nuances. The groom inspires sorrow and is not just a brute: he loves Lucienne but is a limited man who can not deal with her having a life apart from him or attracting the attention of other men. Even the "other man" in history is not the simple ball we first took him, though his intentions may be as possessive as those of the groom. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** ATTENTION: SPOILERS BELOW ************* The film has very well-defined pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the "Miss Europe" contest, shown through the comic reactions of several members of the audience who end up throwing the heroine with flowers ; her misery as a housewife, peeling potatoes while the pendulum of the cuckoo clock marks the time behind her; a nightmare trip to an amusement fair (in the silent version, this occurs at the end of the movie, after her marriage), in which Lucienne, crushed among casualties and depressed by her husband's machista pranks, decides she can not go with its current existence; and especially the final scene in the projection room, where she sees her talking screen test. Louise Brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she here, with the beam of the projector blinking in her alabaster profile, her shoulders wrapped in white skin, her face glowing under the black helmet of her hair as she watched herself sing on the screen. The double shot of her exquisite body and her still-alive image on the screen is particularly poignant: Louise Brooks's image, like Lucienne's, remains immortal despite her frustrated cinematic career.
