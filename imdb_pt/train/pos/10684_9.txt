Looking at this early DeMille work, it was once again reinforced that the initial DeMille is far superior to the late DeMille. His attention to the use of light within scenes is remarkable. Its pace is very good, allowing much to be said in the space of an hour or more. It's a shame he was not as intuitive about the style of his latest sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I had ever seen Cleo Ridgely. She was remarkable, quite restrained, and still conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions. <br /> <br /> The ending is wonderful.
