Frankly I do not understand why this movie has been a big "failure" in advertising. Sharon Stone certainly has not lost anything of his charisma and "touch" from "basic instinct". I voted this movie 10 and I tell you why: The game opens in London this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the BI1 events. Again, she proves to be an idealized manipulator of her own class - unchallenged. She's "screwing up her brain" like Catherine with such skill that in the end you're not sure who the real villain is. <br /> <br /> As for the technical part of the film: Only real setback is the B-rate actor team. Sharon Stone is the only great name of the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas in the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone was a little younger, but she's still quite impressive in her looks and just improved in her charisma. His B-rate "assistants" are not as bad, though I wanted some bigger names for the cast. <br /> <br /> I think there are very good improvements in the basic plot. I think this is a much better thriller than many of the Hollywood sluts so readily distributed today. The plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you do not snore in the middle of the movie and, more importantly, health is on.
