Nice despite Leslie Howard's performance. Howard plays Philip as a flat and uninteresting character. One is supposed to feel sorry for this man; however, I find myself applauding Mildred de Bette Davis. Davis does one of her best performances (she received an Oscar nomination). Thanks to her performance, she gives life to this somewhat tedious film. ** Be sure not to lose when Mildred tells Philip exactly how she feels about him.
