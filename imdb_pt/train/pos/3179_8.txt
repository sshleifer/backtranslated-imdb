Who made this movie? I love this movie? Someone has an eccentric sense of humor ... <br /> <br /> This surreal style of making movies is very appealing, but it is hard to create - or easy to forget - that substance and characters that really have souls. , is what gives a film depth like this. Without it, a comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who cares. You can laugh, but it passes you like a good hamburger ... next ... Crosseyed can not claim to change anyone's life, but I appreciate the depth and the substance. They come close to you. I started this movie thinking "Oh, I understand - indie comedy - off the wall - gonzo ... yup" And that's it - but if you pay attention, there are moments in subtext and character filling it. In this sense, the film breathes. He makes propositions that give pause - if you are available to see them - and then, of course, go your way insanely joyful. <br /> <br /> You will miss the point if you do not sign the contract. contract to suspend the belief in moments of the film. Stepping between reality and surrealism is one of the points of this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but smart people have succeeded. I want more. <br /> <br /> The scenes from the dining room are a real HOOT. <br /> <br /> Put on your seat belt.
