This is a scary ghost story. I showed them to some friends of mine in my movie club, and they were kept fascinated until the end! No blood or blood - just the good old suspense. It starts from the beginning and builds and builds. The end is a real turnaround that caught me by surprise. <br /> <br /> Well run and well represented. It is also a "period piece" - set in the 1920s - that was added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed that I received Susan Hill's book from Amazon. The film follows the book very closely. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that it's not available on DVD. My copy is VHS. This along with "Haunted" are probably two of the best ghost stories I've ever seen. What only serves to show that a little creativity overcomes "in your face" every day!
