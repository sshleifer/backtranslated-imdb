Obviously, this is geared towards the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but it is different in its least cartoon sense (despite the deliberately caricatured characteristics of the leading creatures). The story is not one that had a massive morality at the end (it's more like pulling on the sleeves of the shirt), but choose to tell a story about relationships between different "animals." You know the result, but you can not help being drawn. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are much more than their voices (the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely believable, strangely. The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character's revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. You will find yourself cheering for them much sooner than you would like to think. <br /> <br /> The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and his desperate attempts to bury his balls. I went out wanting the obligatory merchandise, especially the toy of laziness, only to be disappointed the next day when I could not find anything loosely related. <br /> <br /> Which, strangely, makes the film even purer. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.
