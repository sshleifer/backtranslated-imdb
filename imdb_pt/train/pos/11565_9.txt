SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "hell is other people". In "The Odd Couple", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be. Like Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together. As the two begin to get increasingly frustrated with each other, the laughter comes fast and glaring, before Felix leaves, leaving Oscar with a change and more clearly individual. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely superb. like the neurotic, cleaning up the obsessive divorce dealing with life as a single man. Walter Matthau, in contrast to Lemmon's character, is as good as the sports writer who simply wants to play poker to make money for his benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are magnificent in their selected parts, to some. degree dependent on the beautiful script of Neil Simon and simultaneously because they function well as a team. Like two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles, albeit similar in relationships with ex-wives and children, these two great actors create a partnership that is virtually impossible to recreate. So great indeed that the world screamed so much for something similar, that two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemmon, the characters were brought together in an inferior sequence. This idea, while following Hollywood's annoying obsession with sequels, might have worked to some degree, but at the same time, it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is not really possible to say anything else. With Simon's incredible script, full of humor and laughter, the creators of this movie were already on a hit. The cast of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, is the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple," with its traditional soundtrack (which even earned a tribute in "The Simpsons"), is an excellent screenplay and is a genial male leader, a tribute to the movies and a resource for the story to remember.
