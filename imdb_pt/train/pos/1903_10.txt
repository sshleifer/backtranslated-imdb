Ok, even if you do not support Liza, this movie is really hilarious! The scenes with John Gielgud make up for Liza. One of the true classics of twentieth century romantic comedy. Dudley Moore makes getting drunk and irresponsible looks cute and fun and is so much fun to watch! One-liners are the best.
