A fun kung fu movie, with action scenes, plot and fight a cut above the average chop socky. All of the cast are friendly characters and skilled martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comedy comedies are fun to watch, and his austere companion shows particularly impressive skills. For me, the only glaring flaw in the movie is the size of the cast - sometimes things get a little confusing as the movie cuts and swaps between several subplots, and some of the characters are not as full as you might wish. <br /> <br /> But a kung fu movie should be judged first on the quality of the action, and the Shaolin Temple definitely delivers that. The movie climaxes with a high body battle that allows each character to show their skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> <br /> Overall, Shaolin Temple is a nice, low-budget kung fu movie. Not up to the quality of a good Jet Li movie, but definitely worth looking at fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Miscellaneous notes: The 1987 Warner Home Video release I saw was (predictably) poorly voiced and did not have full cast and crew credits.
