I would not say this is a bad movie; in fact, is quite typical of the kind of film the "poverty row" studios were releasing at the time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in her role as a somewhat demented medical-scientist, disguised as a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and her henchmen have a bad habit of robbing young brides and, after death, inject into Bela's wife a serum taken from their bodies to keep her young. Lugosi is more than ready to make this film a pleasant film, however, the film suffers from the ultra-Madeiran performance of stars Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. Coffin (good name for a guy in a horror movie) is especially bad in this case. I've seen him in several movies and TV shows and he's always the same; hard, wooden and totally unconvincing. Miss Walters is just a little better, but she also does not have the acting talent to make her role believable. Still, the viewer can appreciate the great act of Lugosi as another cowardly scheme only to be frustrated in the end! Despite the poor acting of some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a nice movie for everyone to see.
