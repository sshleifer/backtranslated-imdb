I've seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies, but this one is so unique, so new, it will make you wonder why you've always been good at the video store. Murphy has some pretty funny jokes, but that's just too funny to pass. If only all the movies could be funny. must be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy" Murphy is a comic genius in this movie and will make you say "this is the guy who made Dr. doulittle!" He talks about the ice cream shop, the mothers who play shoes, the aunt with a mustache, racism and everything else you could imagine and the ones you could not. Please, if you've ever seen a comedy in your life, this is it, if all the movies could be Delirious.
