I first watched the Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 and thought that both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job, they should have it anyway, because since I watched the movies, I've tried to learn so much about Royal Sheriff Buford Pusser how can I. All 3 parts of the movie gave me shivers and Buford Pusser was a true hero, I just wanted him to be alive today and there were more people like him. I would love to thank you for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. I am very sorry that your family has suffered so much horror and pain. My heart goes out to them. So, from a 30 year old fan of Sheriff Pusser and the 3-part Walking Tall movies and the actors who portrayed him, please do not be negative about these movies and actors, they were just trying to tell us that a wonderful man The real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And for all the young people who may not have heard much about Buford, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about it.
