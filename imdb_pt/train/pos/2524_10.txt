I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as well made as they were, nor did I expect them to be presented in such a well-developed artistic film with enough plot to keep it interested and diversity enough to make it original. This movie was an unexpected work for me, and I'll be looking for the next movie like this. I especially like the fact that it's a vampire movie, but it was not a vampire movie, nor about embellishing that fact. All the characters had human traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters has been incredibly tasty, and makes you really feel sorry for them all your life. I give this movie two thumbs so far. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the last five years.
