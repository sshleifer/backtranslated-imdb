I was absolutely impressed with John Cassavetes' Opening Night. It's his first movie I've seen that seems to be on a larger scale, so he feels more mainstream, but still does not feel like he's landed more than he has in his previous films. That is perhaps what makes it so intense. There is also something undeniably cathartic about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about what Cassavetes actually did part of his career, an ideal that he expressed behind the cameras throughout his career as a director and is here expressing this up front. The character of Rowlands, middle-aged actress Myrtle Gordon, can not play her part in the next production as writing, so it follows an impulse after impulse, resulting in what appears to be chaos on the stage, until you find the right path . It is a boldly abstract premise. <br /> <br /> This is a film that does not fail to capture the innate direction that goes by during an emotional cleansing. No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things she does, and this is seen and even portrayed as destructive, but it may be the best thing for her. It can be a cleansing instead of a collapse. A retreat, a cocoon, a rebellion, all culminates in a collapse. Cassavetes gives her character a brutally royal touch, which is so early, she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character but she is in a quiet but emotionally corroded fear that the opposite is true. The last scene, the climatic performance that Myrtle shares with a painfully distant character of her who is acting with her, is one of the most interesting, hilarious, compelling, enlightening and enjoyable moments I have ever seen in one movie.
