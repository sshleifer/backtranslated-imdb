This, the most beautiful achievement of the period of Social Realism of Georg Wilhelm Pabst is based on a tragedy in early 1906 that reaped the lives of almost 1100 French miners when an explosion of coal dust in Courrieres in the north of France occurred after a fire having burned for three weeks, eventually releasing deadly gas that caused the fatalities. The esteemed designer Erno Metzner creates scenarios that simulate the tragedy, providing a perception of reality, augmented by incomparable sound editing, with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the initial and final parts of a work for which the auditory effects have equal importance. eminent director's fascinating visual compositions. Pabst's "invisible editing" way that follows shooting action through player movements proves to be smoothly integrated within this striking movie that also exhibits sublime cinematography using camera-mounted vehicles, allowing the director to switch between scenes without have a need to cut. While the main theme of the work is related to socialist dogma, the unforgettable power of this film is kept to its detail, born of Pabst's unmatched ability to weave countless lines into a movie tapestry that arouses admiration for the German rescue squads of whom it is his homeland. very proud, no less desperate with disastrous losses to the families of the French victims; certainly a seminal triumph totally as stimulating today for a filmmaker as it was at the time of its first release.
