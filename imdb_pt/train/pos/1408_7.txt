A team of Pentagon scientists seems to have perfected a serum that causes invisibility, but when the chief clerk experiments it, he can not reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk on power, he becomes psychotic in the classic HG Wells tradition. <br /> <br /> This is a story of the Invisible Man who is cheerfully horrible, happily presented by Verhoeven and Bacon's always good taste as the genius who turned. manic-crazy As with much of Verhoeven's work, he has a fantastic rampaging sense of Boy's comic book adventure (the secret underground lab where scientists work is simply wonderful) combined with the most horrible and depraved visuals (women in underwear being attacked by an invisible demon, animals beaten to death, literally gallons of blood, and slaughtered wholesale on the last two reels). Although the story does not touch anything new on an old idea, the special CG effects of Scott E. Anderson are brilliant as we see veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh, all literally appear out of nowhere. In particular, a sequel in which the team brings a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene in which Bacon drowns Devane in a pool, are absolutely breathtaking in the details and the artistic invention of the effects. The film also has a great soundtrack of Jerry Goldsmith and the classic photography of horror films by Jost Vacano. The young cast is pretty overshadowed by the film's technical pedigree, but Shue and Dickens are stunningly out of their depth. This is a great nasty movie.
