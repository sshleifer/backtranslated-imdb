The Garde à Vue has to be seen several times to understand the subplots it contains. If you are not accustomed to French films, based on conversations and struggles rather than action, do not even try to watch. You will only get bored to death, and ensured the opinion that French films are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a long-winded film, essentially based on dialogues (written by Audiard by the way) and cruelly cuts the veil of appearances. <br /> <br /> Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child killer rather than telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he had an 8-year-old sexual relationship. His wife knows this, she is jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980, in France, there was still death penalty) instead of revealing the only "pure and innocent" aspect of his deplorable life.
