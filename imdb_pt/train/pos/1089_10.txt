This movie was made in 1948, but it's still true today. Very, very funny. It starts with a family wanting to buy a small place in the country and "builds" from there. Anyone who has already built a home will find this film very captivating. Great cast. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are wonderful in this movie. This is a classic black and white movie that reflects the grand style of the 1940s ... clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are made to the cost of things, and these comparisons with the current costs are quite surprising. I can not imagine anyone who does not like this movie completely. I'm surprised at the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of him. A real classic.
