This 1991 NBC-TV movie aired six months before leaving John Goodman's film version of Babe Ruth's life. For my money, there is no comparison between the two. TV production is not perfect, but it presents Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional narration. I particularly liked the film's description of Ruth's complex love-hate relationship with Yankee entrepreneur Miller Huggins, who always understood the brilliance of her star and also tried to show why Ruth's character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader. players. The TV movie rightly observes how Ruth never fulfilled her dream of managing the Yankees because of her flaws while Goodman's horrible version tries to push the falsehood that Ruth was denied what should have been his for the take. This movie is a great piece for "Eight Men Out" since the story begins with the arrival of Ruth in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox scandal and when her home run explores baseball saved from ruin. In fact, the continuity between the two films is even more pronounced, with John Anderson reprising his role as "Eight Men Out" as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
