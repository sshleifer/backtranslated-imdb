This one is out there. There is not much to say about it except that it deals with a theme rarely touched on bestiality movies. I can see why this movie has been banned for so long, the topics covered in the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say that the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits with the mood of the film. It's a good movie that is well represented and serves a purpose ... to shock the viewer and cross borders that we do not see in movies. I found this movie on the net that I thought I could take a look at. I liked the movie as it is thoughtful and a little erotic at the same time. Something you rarely see in movies today.
