Many of the reviews and reviews I read about this movie say that this is a very old Clara Bow movie and performance. Although the story line was pretty typical of Clara's last silences, I still find it a bit thrilling and incredibly fun. Clara plays a cheerful Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves ... no matter if this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking on the day, but I believe this lends the overall sweetness and fun of the film. Although definitely not a brilliant story line (quite typical, actually), this film is a beautiful demonstration of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
