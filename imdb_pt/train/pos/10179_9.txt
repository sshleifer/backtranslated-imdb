De Grot is a very good movie. The great plot comes from the novel by Tim Krabbe, who also adapted that story to the screen. Some really first-class acting, not only by Van HuÃªt, but especially by Marcel Hensema, who mostly did the TV work before his performance of Axel van de Graaf. The film seems to be a thriller and sets a great mood. Then we begin to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story unfolds little by little in a very convincing back-flash structure, which contributes to the more romantic aspect and drama directed by the character of the film. In the end, all this culminates in an emotional ending, which will draw the public through their throats. Make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you will see this movie. Must do, especially if you liked 'Spoorloos' (the original Vanishing screen adaptation).
