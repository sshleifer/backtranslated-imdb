The film never claims to be something spectacular as many movies do. The films present themselves as a fun and entertaining moment. And that's exactly what it was. It's the Korean version of a male Bring It On. From the beginning you can feel for the rest of the movie and how it's going to end, but the pleasure is not in the twists of the surprise nor is it the way the movie is a copy of the other. Instead, pleasure is kept on the journey of how the two remaining "bandits" have become men in their own right. So the movie is fun and fun. <br /> <br /> The camera work, especially the dolly moves, were very well executed. The script, being a bit weak, was overly agreeable in the fact that the characters were not two-dimensional, but they were full of life and desire. This movie will not win any Oscars, nor sales of great hits on DVD, but a fun timepiece and a fun experience.
