I agree with another reviewer here and I have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies of all time! I watched this as a child and absolutely loved it! The scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathize with this guy because he is treated like an outcast. Good humor and fantastic kung fu this rocks movie! If you like Kung Fu, you would love it !!!
