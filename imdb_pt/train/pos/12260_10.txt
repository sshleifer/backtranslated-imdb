This is a great start to Mickey Rooney's film career. His talents here show that a long career is ahead of him. The chase of cars and trucks is exciting for the 1937 era. This beginning of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. Spring Byington's performance is excellent as usual. Please Mr. Rooney or Movie Owners, take the risk and get that on DVD. I think it would be a winner.
