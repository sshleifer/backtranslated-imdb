I just watched this movie today at the Seattle International Film Festival and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Great writing and directing, excellent and compelling interaction between the cast and a great comedic timing. <br /> This film touches on themes that are of universal family and separation. As a result, I can see European, Asian and American audiences finding similarities between this film and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all that were not enough, it has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year ... someone distribute it in the US, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: thank you Maria Flom! It really is a great movie.
