"Girlfight" follows a New York-based high school project of a sense of futility in the world of amateur boxing where she finds self-esteem, purpose and more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is about the movie. So much so that you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shot with a sense of honesty and reality about it, "Girlfight" is not a girl movie and not "Rocky." It's a very human drama that even spectators who do not know boxing can connect.
