This is a film about 17th-century Italian artists and a particular artist, an Artemisia woman, a profession unheard of for women at the time, and she dared to paint the masculine nude detailing her unique musculature. <br /> <br /> The camera work is mostly indoors because that's where the artists work mostly. There are some great photos. Close-ups by candlelight suggest the fine work of classic painters and it is fascinating to see painters and their students supported by elaborate scaffolding brushing details of religious frescoes. Not surprisingly, the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, makeup) are superbly authentic because the Italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is encouraged by her father to study with the great Florentine artist Tassi, who specializes in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but the disinterested Artemisia is presented with more than new painting techniques. After posing for her, Tassi violently rapes her. Your father is outraged. Following are lawsuits. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a rather simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The striking feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes like women running in a field with wind winding their bulky clothes add wonderful effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says that she paints to please herself; Her father paints to please others. As for this movie, it will please more, I think.
