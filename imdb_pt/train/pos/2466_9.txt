I've never watched four hours go by as fast as when I saw this movie. This film restores the power and art to Hamlet that it was always meant to have. Even those famous speeches are made in new and inventive ways. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh is the brightest star. It is his charisma, power and command of the role that defines the film. Making a full and complete version fills in so many holes and allows a fresh appreciation of the tragedy despite the length. Where one would expect the gloomy and gloomy castle clich√©, we are presented with a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The only sadness comes from Hamlet himself, as he should. Worth your time, all four hours.
