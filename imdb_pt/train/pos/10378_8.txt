This movie is an hour of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments. I loved Matt's character, and also Tiny. They seemed the most engaging and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is his cousin is not good), and the police wife and blond biker woman provide some welcome eye candy. I must say I have seen striking similarities between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Bana. My favorite part was the brothel scene, I loved it. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I will get a grade 8. The penalty however, was disappointed. It was a side wave instead of the explosion of proper shoelaces. <br /> <br /> Of course I'm joking. :)
