This was a gem. Incredible performance of the protagonists Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the supporting cast. The film raises a subject not only pertinent to the history of Ireland and Ireland, but also to many communities around the world and many units of marriage within these communities. With intensity and sincerity, the film shows how religious convictions and traditions have created a barrier to a loving and passionate family. The title "Divided Love" could not capture it better. Even if it was a true story and happening in Ireland from the 50s, see how the whole village life wears out and "pogroms" are beginning reminded me of the history of Russia. Intolerance and prejudice are still too powerful in the world and, unfortunately, are deeply hidden within human nature. As in the movie, the character of Liam Cunningham says that "hatred has always existed beneath the surface." It was interesting to note the moral choices people were making in this story. Also the character of a Catholic priest and what happened to him at the end of the story was quite significant. The story, however, gives hope that the love of two people can conquer everything and love makes us better, stronger. The character of Liam Cunningham goes through all the transformation in the course of history becoming a man he always wanted to be. Again the acting is a top notch. The story is swift. The Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended.
