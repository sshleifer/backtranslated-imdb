While watching this film and began to see its characters develop, I could feel that it would be an excellent photo. When you have that feeling, and the film really fulfills these expectations, the experience is rare. I had this feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played fascinating and incredibly strong pieces that were worthy of the Oscars. The support cast was equally strong, creating a winning base for the image to grow. I can say without any hesitation, see this movie that will not disappoint.
