A beautiful film, especially if you like horses, World War II movies and the austere Hungarian Plateau. A story of courage, compassion, and loyalty that transcends generations. Riding is spectacular, as is the horse of the main characters in their own training. <br /> <br /> I'm going to buy this movie and watch it again. This is a family movie and I highly recommend it. A good movie 'Family Nite'. Although there are some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The natives were very interesting in the way they stood firm even at the certain death of a Nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting Brady. A stunningly beautiful film.
