This movie was really good. If you like watching horror movies, I recommend it. The performance was very good, although I thought the actress who played Julie might have had more emotion behind her lines. Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was incredible. I was on the edge of my seat all the time while my friends were panicking and screaming. It was a total success in my opinion and should have reached the big screen. I give you two thumbs up! I would definitely say that if you have not seen it, go rent it. If you have already seen and did not like it, go watch again, because there are completely unreal parts. I also liked how much of the movie was filmed and on the campus of my school.
