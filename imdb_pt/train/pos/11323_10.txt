Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by an h-game. Somehow, the producers have changed that, making this a hit series without any of the h things. It could not have been otherwise, because the character development is great, just as it is portrayed in this series, and any change can ruin perfection (you will understand when you see all the episodes). /> <br /> Despite a relatively slow start (the producer took his time introducing the characters), things get stronger quickly and soon after the mid series, the action gets so intense that you stick to your place. <br /> <br /> The theme of the series focuses on the Holy Grail War, which has been taking place in the city of Fukuky for the past 50 years. The pilot actually begins with the completion of the previous war and develops from there. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that began during the last battle and involved a large part of the city. He reluctantly witnesses a fight between two Servants that triggers his Reiju (holy mark) to summon one of the most powerful servants on the battlefield. Saber. His first contact with Saber left him stunned "Such immeasurable beauty ... I was lost in words". <br /> <br /> You should not compare this series with any other to fully understand your plot. FSN offers much more than some cool sword fights, good animation, spectacular lights, great soundtrack, great character and relationship development. Presents the changes that take place within the personalities of the characters as events precipitate. The action reveals credible emotional and behavioral dynamic patterns of individuals (not similar to the linear type of use of other series) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal, under the mask of perfection, defective characters. <br /> <br /> The character Saber is linked to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such. You should not watch FSN thinking it does not show the viewer the historical fact, just remember that this is a series of adventure / fantasy and not a documentary and enjoy it as much as you can. The ending is sudden and unexpected, and if there were twice as many episodes, I would have watched them in the same breath.
