Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as Fresh Baked! Japanese Bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make the perfect Japanese or pan-ja bread, to Japan and to the Japanese, which will be recognized the whole world. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is just outside. In fact, Yakitate! Ja-pan is not really about bread, but the reaction that comes after eating the bread, and the pun that comes with the reaction. The show is kind because of these puns. From popular anime titles like Naruto, Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to blockbuster movies like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. It's all there. <br /> <br /> So what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre as Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others who use cooking to dominate the world, Yakitate! Ja-pan is purely comedy. Of course, there are times when the story turns into drama, or even murder, but the comedic atmosphere makes you laugh at them. You will be laughing at your own view of the sky. Just watch it. <br /> <br /> Just remember that this is also fiction, although some of the breads made here are based on real bread, eating the home made Japan # 2 will not turn you into a Super Saiyan or Turn your body into rubber.
