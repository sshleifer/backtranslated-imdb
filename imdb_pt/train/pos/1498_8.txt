This is a very entertaining and sometimes quite scary anthology, which, if a bit short in the script department, more than makes up for the deficiency in acting, localization work and overall exuberance. The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliot playing a horror writer chased by a character from his novel in the works (a perfect example of acting out of the merely pedestrian); the third with Christopher Lee as a man terrorized by his own daughter and the final episode with the late Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror movie star who receives more than just a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired, both obviously savoring the opportunity to really screw it up! Cushing is typically good in the weaker segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he is obsessed with at the local wax museum, is anything but "beautiful" as we are told to believe she is! Someone of shocking beauty was needed, and instead we received a woman with a tortoise jaw. Minor quibbles aside this movie and it's wonderful cottage setting is one to pick up when you can.
