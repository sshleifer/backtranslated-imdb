The tremendous night-time black-and-white cinematography, and many of them, highlights this supposedly true life story of a 1950s murder in Kansas, in which a whole family was wiped out by two men. <br /> <br /> The story was written by Truman Capote, so you get the very liberal anti-death message at the end of the movie, which is ridiculous to know the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who have distorted the prospects of life and unnecessarily kill this beautiful family. <br /> <br /> Despite the boring tilt at the end, this is a fascinating story from the outset and cinematography makes it all the more fascinating. Famous photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this. This makes me wish that more modern films were made in black and white. Watch on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and all the support cast are excellent here. My third screening of this film came in early April 2005, shortly after Blake, in real life, was declared innocent at the murder trial of his wife. One can not help looking at Blake and this movie differently after that.
