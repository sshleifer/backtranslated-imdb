Of all the reviews I have read, most people have been extremely hard on Alexander. Neither Marie nor Veronika seemed desperate to keep Alexander, he was just a little clever, though not intellectually, like most of us, as hard as it is to admit. Alexander is coming out with life perfectly, being totally careful, receiving and giving what he wants. the girls are allowing it, veronika loves sex, marie is their patron. Is there something wrong with that? Is someone in love? really? I think not. Although French New Wave cinema is prone to pretensions and so on, it is wonderful simply because of its lack of a plot to create emotion. The facility is perfectly amiable and anyone in Alexander's position, in an urban area, may ask. Am I looking for a patron, someone interested?
