This kind of movie about young teenagers struggling with their own sexuality was something unique, daring and daring a few years ago, but more and more movies like this have been made in recent years, making it difficult for the movies to continue to stand out. <br /> <br /> This film also received little publicity, apart from the usual small film festivals that contained this little French film, as well as the big festivals that always like this kind of little movies about everyday things that are not being treated very often in movies. The film premiered at Cannes in 2007 and also won a few awards there. <br /> <br /> The film really does not stand out from the others, as it actually presents little new, once you've seen some similar movies. like this, but this, however, does not mean that "Naissance des pieuvres" is bad to watch. The film is certainly a good watch, which handles well with its subject and tells its story steadily and therefore also effectively, in a somewhat slow French film rhythm. <br /> <br /> It is a maturing film that focuses on the lives of mainly 3 half-teens totally different. Sexuality is a major theme within the film, which is treated delicately and subtly. This makes the film and its story in general quite realistic, though perhaps somewhat predictable, since the film offers nothing original enough within the genre. <br /> <br /> This kind of French movie will probably scare you. many people because of the reason they probably expect it to be very artistic, with deep layers and meanings for it. "Naissance des pieuvres", however, is a very affordable movie for everyone and you really do not need to be in teen movies to enjoy this movie. It is a kind of sweet and somewhat sensual film, due to its subject and visual approach. <br /> <br /> The film is also being done realistically by its actors, who did not have and had much experience inside the film. movie business, but are authentic looking and feeling within their functions. The strong individual characters give the film beautiful themes and good moments. <br /> <br /> A good movie about it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
