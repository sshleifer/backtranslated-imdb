What percentage of movies does a person visit today that leaves them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO! This movie is not like that. It's a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both, nice and nasty. <br /> <br /> Disadvantage: There is not enough character development and some plot lines are left in the wind. <br /> <br /> Upside down: <br /> <br /> It forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or ill in their own lives. <br /> <br /> Well represented by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. <br /> <br /> Contains a cheerful humor.
