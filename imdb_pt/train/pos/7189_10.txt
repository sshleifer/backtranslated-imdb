My very favorite character in movies, but in almost all of them the character of Zorro has a small piece of cloth as a mask and if the villain does not know who is under that cloth, then they are crazy. <br /> <br /> But in Reed Hadley's "Legion of Fighting Fox" (1939), the mask fills his whole face, becoming a true mystery about who really is the Fox. <br /> <br /> But, finally, Zorro is one of the best characters in movies and to update him, I think Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a delight. <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is vast, but I have a real liking for the 1930s and '40s serial. <br /> <br /> Bond2a
