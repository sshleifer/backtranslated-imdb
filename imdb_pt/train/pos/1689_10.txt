This movie is for Halloween what the hilarious "Christmas Story" is for Christmas: both are low-budget movies with no big names ... and both are two of the biggest and funniest movies available, both seasonal. CLASSICS !!! "Spaced Invaders" comes galloping from the start with warmth and humor and an excellent cast of characters ... all five goofy Martians, Realtor Klembecker, Deputy Russell, Vern in the "Fuel Distribution Depot" and many more ! You just have to see this movie to believe it, and like "Christmas Story," it gets better every time, and you get little fun things every time !! Most definitely ten!
