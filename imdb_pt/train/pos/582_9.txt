As a habit, I always enjoy reading the ratings of 'hated' any movie. especially one that I would like to comment on. and it is not so much a sorts of point-counterpoint agreement; I just like to see what people say on the flipside. <br /> <br /> However, I want to address one thing. many people who hated it called it, paraphrasing, "handsome but shallow," some even saying that the norm's desire, even the inability to help his brother, was a mundane plot at best. <br /> I would like to disagree. As a brother of a brother who has a similar dysfunction, I can relate. daily, you see them abusing themselves, knowing only that the present path will inevitably lead to self-destruction. and it's not about the details of what they did when; how or why Paul decided to bet and associate with questionable people; it really is more how they are connected. on the one hand, they are real geniuses, and on the other hand, painfully self-destructive (it's like people like howard hughes - the same forces that drive them are the same forces that separate them) and all the time you see it, you know it , and what's worse, you realize you can not do anything about it. For Norman Macclean, a river passes through it was probably a way to find an answer as to why. the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame. in the end, no one is, and often, there is no why. but it takes a lot of personal anguish to actually come to that conclusion. sometimes it takes a lifetime. and sometimes it never happens.
