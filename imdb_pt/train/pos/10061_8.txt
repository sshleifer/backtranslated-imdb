One of the most moving foreign films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The young woman is an incredible talent. Spectacular performances by her (Puppy), the old man (the king of the masks) and Liang (the Living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The deplorable treatment of children, especially women, is disturbing. <br /> I loved the music. The original Chinese dialogue increases the emotional intensity of performances and history. <br /> <br /> This is a family movie you SHOULD NOT SEE - although not for very young children. I would have evaluated the DVD release even more if the soundtrack had been better transferred to the DVD and the transfer included the widescreen version.
