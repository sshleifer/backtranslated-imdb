Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde, a serious photographer, who is going through a bad divorce. She wants your freedom, but it comes at a cost. She wants to legitimize photography, but is hired to work for the tabloids as paparazzi. His boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written most of the time. Nora, from TEa, was starting to become a memorable character, but the network simply did not support the comedy and they still do not. Even when they brought in George Wendt from Cheers, they made unnecessary changes to the cast and characters. The show was good in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it, but the network spoils everything like bad plastic surgery.
