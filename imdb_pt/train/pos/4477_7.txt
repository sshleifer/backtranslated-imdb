This has a lot to do - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller amount of scum - Iturbi, Grayson - and a little humor - Kelly. It was Sinatra's first real movie, where the producer spent a buck and you could see him on the screen (previously he appeared in two low-budgeters, Higher And Higher and Step Lively), but if they only trusted the Sinatra tubes and Six Grayson's plus from Iturbi, where we play ego piano, we get a much tighter movie and a better showcase for Sinatra. As it is, he scores heavily on all his songs from the two duets with Kelly - We Hate Leaving, I Begged - for his own solos, What Makes the Sunset, The Spell of You and I Easily Fall in Love. Despite this, Step Lively remains the best Sinatra musical of the 1940s, with one tenth of the budget.
