If you're already a fan of Peter O'Donnell's wonderful Modesty Blaise books from the 60's, you'll really enjoy this movie. If you've ever seen the 1966 film "Modesty Blaise", forget it! That was camp. This is the real Modesty Blaise. The story and character are both faithful to the modesty that book fans know and love. It's a far cry from Joe Losey's 1966 farce and takes our modesty very seriously. Alexandra Staden is very good and believable in the part, and yes, we get to see her kick her butt. [Laughs] <br /> <br /> This is likely to be the first film in a series and as such serves to introduce Modesty, his childhood and his days with Lob. <br /> <br /> Since Peter O 'Donnell was the creative consultant to the film, everything really rings true. Even the story O'Donnell told about how he conceived the character is exactly as he said it. Having read all the books, I liked the movie even more so. <br /> <br /> Now that Miramax has kept his option on the estate by getting Quentin Tarrentino to make this movie, I hope to see more of Modesty. stories as soon as possible. Especially since the wonderful character of Willie Garvin makes the character of Modesty really come to life. To that end, I really hope the film does well in Europe. I have no idea if Miramax plans to distribute the DVD in the US. I suspect you may not do this well in the US in the general distribution. I wonder how Miramax decides where and how to distribute your movies. <br /> <br /> In history, Modesty is in his 20s working in the Louche casino in Tangier. The flashback sequences are made with art and take Modesty from about 9 years old through his teenage years to his current age in the film - about 21-22, I think. I really do not think there's a "perfect actress" for Modesty. For many of us, fans of Modesty, it is already a very powerful presence in our imagination. Alexandra Staden is credible. She is very skinny, graceful and balanced. She has lots of closes. She has a great face - one that stays in her head well after the movie is over. According to the illustrator of O 'Donnell, Romero, Modesty has a more complete figure than Staden, but I am willing to ignore it. If Staden continues on paper, I think she will mature - just as Modesty becomes more powerful and skillful as she ages. Staden already conveys the mood and absolute safety of Modesty very well. Go ahead and rent this movie, it's not like anything else you've seen and even being directed by Scott Spiegel, it's full of Tarrentino touches, great camera moves, lighting and action sequences.
