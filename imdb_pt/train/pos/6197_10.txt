Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a complete puzzle movie. It has all the acting parts, direction, plot and entertainment value. They all fit together and when this creates a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This film follows a single mother Fay Grim trying to raise her son to not grow up and be her father who ran away from the law and disappeared. Soon the CIA contacts with Fay in desperate search to find 8 magazines of its husband, Henry. These magazines were full of confessions of his long past in the CIA and of his involvement with countries and their deeds of government. Fay is sent to find these journals in exchange for freeing her brother from prison, and is sent in a cat-and-mouse chase all over Europe to retrieve those journals and learn about the hidden secrets of their husbands she has never met. Parker Posey had once been an actress I liked after watching her at The OH in Ohio and the Best in Show. She brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of her, but Fay Grim was a very different role from the other two films. Posey made me believe what was happening on the screen, I felt for her, I wished for her and wanted to know more. She grabs you while she's on the screen and when she's out you can not stop thinking about what's happening to her. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any previous work by writer / director Hal Hartley, but I believe I will check out some of his earlier films if they are half the size of Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to make a smart movie choice the next time you decide to rent a movie or buy a DVD I recommend you choose Fay Grim. If you have some good sense of how a movie should be, you will enjoy this movie immensely.
