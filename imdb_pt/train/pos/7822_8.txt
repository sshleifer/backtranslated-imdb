It is sad to see this film now that we know how the ANC was hit by international capitalism. Biko died for nothing much. Woods did little. Yes, apartheid was abolished, but the whole apparatus of power was reserved by minority whites, leaving the ANC government more or less impotent. As Naomi Klein writes in The Shock Doctrine in the talks between black and white leaders, "the deklerk government had a dual strategy, first of all tapping into the bottom-up Washington Consensus that there was not just one way to run an economy." of economic decision-making - as commercial policy and central bank - as "technical" or "administrative". It then used a wide range of new policy tools - international trade agreements, innovations in constitutional law, and adjustment programs - to hand control of those power centers to supposedly unbiased specialists, economists, and officials of the IMF, World Bank, GATT and the National Party - anyone except the ANC liberation fighters. "The statistical results are horrifying, with few changes taking place and the blossoming of AIDS." Seeing the cry Freedom in this light is profoundly ironic - indeed tragic.The ANC has turned from being the solution to being the main problem.
