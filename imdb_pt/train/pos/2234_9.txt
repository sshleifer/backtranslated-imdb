While the 'special effects' and technical attributes of this film may indeed be laughable to some, I have never been able to erase the images from this movie imprinted on my young impressionable mind when I first saw it around 8 years old. The story of this girl's survival and the trials she endured remained with me all those years, and I have recalled on more than one occasion how the girl came out of situations far beyond anything I have seen. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a true story, and the fact that I was only a child when I first saw this may be the reason behind my high rating of this movie. Every time this movie aired on television in the 70s and 80s, I would be fascinated with television, drinking in each scene with an interest I can not explain. I suppose seeing this for the first time as an adult (and with a weary view of the world) may not be so enjoyable to some. I really went out of my way to get a copy so that I could show this movie to my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other films, is not for everyone. If you are impressed with the remarkable stories of human survival, it is partial to Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or the Amazon, so I believe you may like this movie as much as I appreciate it 30 years ago.
