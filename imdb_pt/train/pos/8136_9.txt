This movie is a great documentary. Following is the rap group, NWH, composed of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def through their unique path to the ups and downs of gangster rap, ups and downs. Through problems with women, egos, police officers and whitey, this group reaches the top of the gangster rap world, as this movie goes to the top of the mocumentaries. I know mocumentary everybodies favorite is This is Spinal Tap, for good reason, however, I think if in the good mood, this movie is simply better. The laughter never ends, even for someone who does not like rap culture. <br /> <br /> I am a white guy who has no interest in rap, culture or anything else associated with it, however I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif who wrote the screenplay, songs and starred showed great potential and it's a shame I have not seen him since Fear of the Black Hat. However, I've seen him one more time than you, and this is what I recommend Fear of a Black Hat for you for quick laughs. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Do not shoot for you to see the whites! .... from your eyes? No, do not shoot for you to see the whites." <br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
