Several posters cited Renoir expressing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling at the camera. The short answer is not all of us, while the harsh reality is that only a few have managed to do so. At this stage of his career, Bergman could not be arrested; in 1949, she left Hollywood to take a picture in Europe, fell in love with director Roberto Rossellini and never waited. After five turkeys in Italy, she was probably ready to open a vein, but within a year, after doing this for Renoir, she was back where she belonged and with an Oscar to boot for Anastasia. This is one of three films that Renoir has done in color around this time and, on balance, it is better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult, and even with the French Can Can. Renoir probably figured that with so much for her, Bergman could get along with some leading wooden men and Renoir chose two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid Mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history, but Renoir is content to give it a once in a while and focus on replicating his father's paintings in the setup after installation. In its pastel colors resembles another film from the Les Grandes Manouvres period, which is not bad. In short, it remains a nice trifle featuring a beautiful and charismatic actress.
