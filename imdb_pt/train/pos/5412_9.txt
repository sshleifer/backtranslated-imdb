As a Pokémon fan I really liked this movie. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (as does each movie) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. However, I do not expect those who are not Pokémon fans to like it (this includes most adults). Some of the lines were cheesy, but that may be a bit unavoidable when moving the film to English. The animation was beautiful, although there were some parts that did not look good. And while the villain is a bit cheesy, I think the movies did a good job of covering different types of villains, and I guarantee that not everyone is like that. Those who did not like it, I say to each of them, but Pokémon fans will love it.
