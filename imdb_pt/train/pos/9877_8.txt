<br /> <br /> Presenting Lily Mars is a genre of film that unfortunately seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok, now that you know my bias, here are some reasons I think this movie stands out. <br /> <br /> 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York, becomes a star, and wins the heart of its director (Van Heflin) is a beautiful Hollywood story of the time , writers vary her theme a little more than normal. Although Lily has a great chance when the star gives up, she is not successful and has to swallow her pride and re-play a minor role in the show. <br /> <br /> 2. Judy Garland (enough is said!) <br /> <br /> 3. The support cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truly wonderful, as is Fay Bainter (the director's mother - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The highlight in performance is actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie, an actress who became guardian of the theater. <br /> <br /> It pays to be sure. One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams.
