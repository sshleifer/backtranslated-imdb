This film seems at first glance to be a series of children's films that parents can watch with regret for their most entertaining children. The movie looks and is mostly aimed at kids, but not for this level. I watched this movie first as a kid and found it funny, fun and comforting and have not seen it again for several years. I watched it again recently at age 18 and found it was almost as funny but so moving and fun. This movie is highly underrated and contains many real-life messages. This movie is an inspired search story that is made for children yet epic by itself. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
