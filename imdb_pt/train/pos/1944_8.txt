This is an excellent film about the characters of an adult swimming lesson, their problems, relationships, and interactions with each other. It should have gotten a wider distribution, since it's way better than similar movies from big studios at the same time. <br /> <br /> The swimming instructor is an almost Olympic athlete, reduced to teaching basic lessons for adults, and often the horndogging target of his students. He tries, more or less, to push them away, with varying results. <br /> <br /> Students' characters are prevalent in the US; teachers, police officers, university students and retirees, who have not learned to swim for some reason. The film covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic achievements during class. A number of subplots provide a fun foundation, including a teacher undergoing a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is just in class to meet people. <br /> <br /> This is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you are in the mood for a romantic drama with touches of reality.
