This is one of my favorite comedies ever. Not wanting to tolerate his hero's uninteresting lifestyle, but taken for what it's worth and not how to banish alcoholism, the film is just plain fun. It tells the unlikely story of an irresponsible, perpetual, drunken bachelor, 40, named Arthur, who must inherit a large fortune, but only marry Susan, chosen because the family thinks she could do something about him. Arthur proposes, but then insensately falls in love with Linda, a waitress and thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the most friendly drunkard in the world, whose antics are a laugh a minute. It is true that Moore is Arthur and I agree with those who can not imagine any other actor in the role. The ladies of the play are also well portrayed. Liza Minnelli shines like Linda, and she's on screen chemistry with Moore is great. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the richest and most appropriate woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this film is done literally by Sir John Gielgud, who plays the sarcastic but moral butler Arthur, Hobson. It is obvious that these two had a great mutual affection during Hobson's long-standing employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and supplier of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not Arthur's novel, but his unusual relationship with this witty and, of course, perpetually disapproving servant. It's the butler you'll remember better after the final credits.
