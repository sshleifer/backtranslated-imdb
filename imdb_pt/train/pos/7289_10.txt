This was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... I was about 5 years old at the time. That scared me GOOD! But that night I put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mother was very upset. She had to wipe my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like DOUBLE MINT! NOW IT'S A MOVIE! Hey, it's time to be a great movie. That Chief sitting at the lab counter was as real as he was back then. And if your 5 is too scary! Kids are now spoiled by special effects that show a lot and leave nothing to the imagination of their minds. Your mind can imagine things more frightening than special effects! (IMO)
