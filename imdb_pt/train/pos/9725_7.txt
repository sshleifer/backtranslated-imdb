"How To Lose Friends & Alienate People" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It's a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book about his experiences as a journalist covering celebrities. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a British journalist who takes a job at an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York. Young is anxious to get caught up in all sorts of mischief to alienate everything around him, hence the title of the film. He's loud, bold and moronic. But nevertheless, for some very bizarre reason, he is a somewhat sympathetic character. Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the composite Alison Olsen, admirably played by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is eager for actress Sophie Maes, played by Fantastic Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on eye candy material. Sidney goes into all sorts of nonsense to climb up the stairs of the journalist in magazine co. These are the main comic moments of the film. However, I think director Robert Weide and screenwriter Peter Straughan may lose some viewers and alienate the authentic rom-com material, developing an implausible romantic plot between Sidney and Alison; even though the Weidstraughan team has formulated an otherwise entertaining narrative. Pegg made his character to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges was again building bridges "The Dude" with his enigmatic backing work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's soft prez. But the rest of the film's acting was not worthy of being featured here. "How to lose friends and alienate people" should not be alienated entirely, but you may lose some movie friends if you publish it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average
