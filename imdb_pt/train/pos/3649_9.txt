I have seen many TV movies in my time as a student, most of the normal time wasted that American television plays out. This, however, was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice touch in the end. Having just seen Richard Dean Anderson on MacGyver and Stargate, I was amazed at his excellent performance, not at the range of A-B expressions he normally gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long time dating back to The Fly II. It is also good to see Robert Guillaumme in a leadership role again. I can not say that I take Jane Leeves seriously after her days on Benny Hill, but she almost managed to cope well with her role. All in all a highly recommended movie.
