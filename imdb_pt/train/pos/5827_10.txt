This three flick stooges is in a draw with my other favorite movie "Disorder in the Court". This is a riot of laughter for any fan of Three Stooges. <br /> <br /> The boys are janitors in a recording studio when they hear the lovely Christine McIntyre sings a great rendition of "Voices of Spring." She will be offered a recording contract, but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her career choice and prove herself a true singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the clowns decide to have a little fun and play their record and dress like Christine. The hired lady who can do Christine's career, sees Curly and confuses him with Christine and invites Curly to sing for her party. Of course there is a man they have upset who is at the party and they destroy their solo in front of the crowd so he will find a way back to them. <br /> <br /> What a great stooge flick, this should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
