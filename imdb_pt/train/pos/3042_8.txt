The film transported everyone back to October 20, 1944, where we seemed to be part of the great Filipino landing scene of 'Devo Return'? Was it on the Leyte coast where General MacArthur had his fame? <br /> <br /> Above all else, did Gregory Peck triumph in his interpretation of the great general? Is it the step, the set of the shoulders, the intensity? Is it what both men have in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion? With MacArthur gone to the military? With Peck was the challenge of acting ?? Oscar winner for "Keys to the Kingdom," "The Yearling," "Gentleman's Agreement," and "Twelve O'Clock High," he touched everything, seemingly amnesiac homicidal to a crusade journalist; from a troubled gunslinger to an obsessed lawyer; of Biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower ?? Has he brought to them all his own unique vision, his character, his sincerity, warmth, and love, and especially his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where 'MacArthur' is on the deck with the 'President of the Philippines'. We can hear the dialogue: "General, I hope the water is not too deep," says the "President," because my people will find that I can not swim. Then comes the sounding voice of Peck: "And my people will find that I can not walk in the water!" Like "MacArthur," did Peck once again justify his reputation as a giant in the film industry? Through him we feel MacArthur's emotions: do we know his anger, his happiness, and understand the relationship with his whole family?
