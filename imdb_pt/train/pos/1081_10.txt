One of the great classic comedies. Not a comedy of clownery, not a heavy drama. A fun and satirical movie, buyers should be careful with the guide to a new home. <br /> <br /> Full of great characters, all of them, Cary Grant is convinced, are willing to use it in building a dream house. <br /> <br /> A great look at life in the late 1940's. <br /> <br />
