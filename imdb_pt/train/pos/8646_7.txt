In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis made a TV Too Young To Die, where they both played almost the same kind of parts they do in Kalifornia. I have no doubt that this is what led to its cast in this film. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia meets aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girlfriend, art photographer Michelle Forbes, in a complicated relationship due to Duchovny's obsession. with writing a book and entering the minds and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has a more unusual odyssey planned, he wants to go to the country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers. But he and Forbes are broke. <br /> <br /> Fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, two strange southern guys who agree to split the cost of gas in this country. trip. It turns out that Pitt is a serial killer and decides to do a little research on his own, plunging into the mind of someone who is fascinated by amorality. <br /> <br /> Kalifornia is not the kind of film I normally but, in fact, Brad Pitt's acting ability and charisma make everything work to a great extent. Pitt is the walking definition of an endogamic gothic refugee from Deliverance. But better than he is Juliette Lewis, who is once again playing these types of low self-esteem she seems to do well. Watch her scene with Forbes while she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialogue and Forbes' reactions must be shown in acting classes across the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their horror movies, they do not come better than Kalifornia.
