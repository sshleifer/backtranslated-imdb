Sweet and charming, funny and touching, less significant plot, "Before Sunrise" (1995), Richard Linklater's third film, is dedicated to everyone who has ever been in love, are in love, or have never been in love but still dream and expect to find it, it. It is one of the very rare films that is / should / will be equally interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It looks like a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases or long, hot sex scenes. Two young men in their early 20s, two university students (the American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend classes at the Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly, even before they start talking, they get off the train in Vienna, where they have been exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, this is the movie. It could have been boring and silly, but instead it's a lovely, compelling, clever and moving novel that only improves with every display (at least for that viewer). A big compliment and my sincere gratitude to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, excellent writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two incredible performances and the magical atmosphere that is falling in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like an angel by Botticelli, is great at portraying an intelligent, independent and incredibly attractive young woman.
