This initial version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in The Golem a few years later). In this film, he plays a double role (technically impressive for a movie of 95 years to see them in the same photo) after meeting a mysterious man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to conquer a countess who he was previously saved from a drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving at a fast pace (the film lasts just over an hour) and fairly well written and featured, 'The Student of Prague' echoes the legend of Faust and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, starting with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and turning into good and bad sides of the same person.
