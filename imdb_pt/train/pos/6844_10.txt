"Dressed to Kill" is Brian DePalma's best film, an absolute thrill of suspense, humor and style that remains unmatched today. DePalma has a butt in Hollywood, as most people claim that he blows up Alfred Hitchcock. He no. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma shows in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the uncut original version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. The current copy released by Goodtimes is the nominal cut approved by Jack Valenti. But some copies of the original DePalma clipping still exist. That's what is distributed by Warner Home Video, both in a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover, and in a black shell with the theatrical poster in the silver lining. These are the ones to get if you can find a copy. I have the green and it is one of my treasures. <br /> <br /> Anyway, let's get back to history. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated spouse who is being treated by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for his obsessive fantasies. While on a trip to the museum (a true tour-de-force for DePalma in terms of camera work and suspense), Miller is caught by a stranger. You can guess what happens to her, as the advertisements and the cashier's arts reveal the story. But there are some complications. A prostitute (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son, Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime. And Dr. Elliott's answering machine has a certain message ... about a lost razor ... <br /> <br /> I'm not spoiling the movie for you, since what I described above happens in a half opening hour and the biggest surprises of DePalma are reserved for the last hour. This film is explicit, however, enough for Valenti (boss of the MPAA) to demand cuts in the film. What surprises me is what he wanted. Several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two cutting scenes and some of Nancy Allen's dialogues (Valenti wanted "cock" to change to "bulge"). This is a movie that is very violent and bloody, but the objections are to sexual content. I would love to hear Valenti's explanation on how seeing two women in a love scene suit in "Lost and Delirious" is somehow more damaging to a young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger blasting people with a gun. It just is not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes "Dressed to Kill" so good is that not only technical credits are top notch, but also the performances are very good. Michael Caine, who was in a lot of crap in this period of time, gives one of his best performances as the doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than normal, possibly because she has an important role here. Nancy Allen adds this to her range of performances that have her as one of the most underrated and underrated actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is wonderful as the genius and I loved all those inventions of it. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved. The recent joke on the AFI 100 Best Thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is. If they really opened their eyes for the first time, they would see that DePalma bet his career on thrillers and is, in fact, the best craftsman. This is even better than "Psycho". It's a shame that very few actually know this. <br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars
