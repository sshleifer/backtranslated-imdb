This is such a fantastic film, a Western movie about a worried man (Jimmy Stewart) going to the Klondike for gold. On the way, he is bothered by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, giving a wonderfully bad performance), whom he faces back. McIntire threatens that he will be a dead man if he returns through the city, which is unfortunately the only way back to the United States. The main piece of history is about the peaceful town of Dawson in Klondike, turned upside down by new residents of the town of McIntire. Ruth Roman, for example, who came with Stewart and her two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who plays Stewart's best friend), builds a hall (a Hollywood front for a brothel) and tries to run the restaurant. City. hang-out location outside of the deal. It opens the way for McIntire and her henchmen appear too. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just a tiny bit smaller, and contains 99.9% of what made this movie so special without, of course, looking like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country has beautiful cinematography on the premises. The scenery is beautiful. Stewart gives one of his best performances (almost equal to his biggest success of 1954, Rear Window). I suppose it could be considered a clich√© when he starts a selfish loner and learns how this kind of existence unfolds in the end. Still, Stewart plays so well, he makes this character very human. And the supporting performances are universally fantastic. In addition to the ones I mentioned, the lovely French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I should highlight Walter Brennen as well. He seems to have specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character capable of revealing any humanity in the cynical man. The script is very well written, and Mann's direction is impeccable. A masterpiece. 10/10.
