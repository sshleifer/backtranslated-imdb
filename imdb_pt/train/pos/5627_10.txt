This movement really made me jump out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors would do! The acting was the best, Farrah should have gotten an Oscar so she was fabulous. James Russo was so good that I hated him, he was the villain and he played wonderfully. There are not many movies that fascinated me like this. The cast was great Alfie looking shocked at those big eyes Farrah looking like a victim and you relived your horror when she went through it. Farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger that she felt that you wanted her to hurt you, but you also knew it was the wrong thing to do. The movie had you on a roller coaster and you went up and down with each scene.
