I saw this movie for the first time when it aired on the defunct Trio Channel a few years ago and recently watched it again - no commercials - at Sundance. I was impressed for the first time and found it even more engaging in the second exhibit. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical comment stands out as a sore thumb - but taken collectively, 11 09 01 is a total success. The best of the show: the incredible final segment of Shohei Imamura, which contemporary critics like the thick-minded Mick LaSalle interpreted as an attack on "terrorists", but which is now revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic; The opening piece by Samira Makhmalbaf who manages to mix deep empathy with the victims of 9/11 with a prescient concern for the children of Afghanistan; and Idrissa Ouedraogo's amusing crusade of children by Osama Bin Laden - a quest almost as serious and successful as that of REAL Osama. The segment of Youssef Chahine is a noble experiment, if failed, which at least has the courage to remind the public that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically creations of American foreign policy and the CIA, and although the character study of Sean Penn seems dislocated, is still a piece of cinematographic production actually bittersweet. All in all, essential vision, and a better view than Oliver Stone's reactionary World Trade Center.
