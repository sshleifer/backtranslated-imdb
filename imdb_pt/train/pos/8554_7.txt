Wow, this was another good spin off of the original American pie, not as good as the band's camp, but definitely much better the mile bare. Dwight and Erik stifler lead the comedy in this movie, but in fact I have preferred dialogue here for miles on end. The script was written much better and the comedy flowed more smoothly, but most of the comedy came from sex, but okay, because that's why we watched those movies, right? <br /> <br /> Dwarf Rock also had a great turnout, considering the intense effort he made in the middle of the way, his scene with the stifler was incredible and made me laugh when I saw it. <br /> <br /> The movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the bare mile, if you liked previous American Pie movies, you should like to beta home, unless you see all the American pie spin-offs a waste of money.
