A number of factors makes it easier for me to state that I still think this is the most important science fiction film of all time, despite some of the old and ancient dialogues, etc. <br /> <br /> First, there is the scale. of imagination in describing Krell, a humanoid race native to the planet, now all dead, who were 1 million years older than Earth humans, and their technology, particularly the 8,000-cubic-mile machine. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are music and sound effects that are inseparable from each other. It creates a strange and supernatural feeling, unlike "2001", which had traditional classical music. Third, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and mortal ever imagined, it is also based on real science. and does not break the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and more importantly, Forbidden Planet is the only movie of all time that tries and, most amazingly, manages to make an honest, intelligent and ruthless. logical limit or ceiling of human development (or any other biological entity), no matter how long we survive as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable fate.
