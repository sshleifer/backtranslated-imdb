I have to mention two flaws for you to understand that this film brilliantly got where they failed: "The Darkly Scanner" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were excited about the concepts of these two films and felt woefully disappointed (like me), you'll probably like the Renaissance. It plunges you into the world of a future Paris. It is not very dystopic. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscoped, but from what I can tell, it was not, it was just motion capture. The facial expressions are amazing! Not since TRON have I seen a fantasy world so well displayed in a hybrid of live / animation. The black and white medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene; my favorite effect was what they did with the headlights, watch out. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but you are happy to find the thread he wants you to find. The overall effect is a rough and tumble urban world, full of little surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but it is not terrible. It's noir-ish. There is a background story for most of the main characters, giving them some depth. There is time. There are "sets" so you can feel like you are in different places in Paris. There is some action and even a car chase. I'll have to see it again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to view it, because the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.
