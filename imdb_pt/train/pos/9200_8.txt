I read countless posts about this game being so much like Max Payne when I played it the first time I thought it was a weird arcade type game with the desire to steal Max Payne's style (not just bullet-Time). So when I played for a couple of hours, I realized how much fun it was! and how different from "Max Payne", yes the bullet time is a bit alike, but I think it fits differently for the style of play. This game is non-stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up, great fun as a big fan of Max Payne, I must say that the DTR plot is not close to the greatness of Max Payne, the graphics are a little average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a little more than "bullet time" you should definitely own this game.
