An excellent example of the spectacular musicals of Busby Berkeley produced in the early thirties. The public must have been very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Quite a contrast to his "Public Enemy" two years before. Cagney adds spark and interest to a well-timed and tiring plot and plot. But the highlight of the film is the 3 production numbers drawn back to back. First with the conservative number "Honeymoon Hotel," followed by the spectacular sequel to "By A Waterfall," followed by the sequel "Shanghai Lil" closing, Cagney only participates in the latest issue appearing on top of a bar. counter with Ruby Keeler. The "Shanghai Lil" number with Cagney is excellent but a bit of comedown and anti climax following the most exciting and incredibly incomprehensible "By The Waterfall" choreography. If I were the director I would have inserted the number "Shanghai Lil" in the middle and close with "By a Waterfall" which blows the other 2 numbers out of the water, so to speak and in my opinion the best of the 3 numbers. The 3 production numbers are the icing on the cake and the performance of James Cagney is added to the cake. An excellent musical feat, a 4 star movie, the best musical, worth watching, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
