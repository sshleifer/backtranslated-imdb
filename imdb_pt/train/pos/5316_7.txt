This is the second film I saw of Ida Lupino as director after the 53, the hitch-hiker. I think this was a better movie than that. This one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and does not like everyone looking and talking about her, so she runs away and is taken away by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's criticism is correct just to give 2 and 1/2 stars.
