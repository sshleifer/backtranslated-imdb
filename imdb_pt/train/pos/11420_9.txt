This film is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-changing limits of customs, race relations, and desire. Granted, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no car chases, no building exploding, no murder. The drama is in the tension suggested by looks, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, enlightenment, and things left - sometimes very blatantly - unspoken. It is about identity, memory, community, belonging. The different parts of the film work together to reinforce the leitmotiv of self and other, identity, desire, limits and losses. This will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer. It will displease those whose palates require explosive action, massive and spicy. It's a beautifully filmed human story. That is all.
