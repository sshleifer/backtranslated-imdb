I was the production accountant on this film, and I also did some narration work on it, so I'm not totally impartial, but if it was horrible, I would say. I thought it was a fun movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece by any means, but there were lots of laughs along the way. The Bible says that laughter does well as a remedy, so watching that movie may be good for your health. <br /> <br /> So many of the actors in this picture had not yet peaked at the time we made the film. this movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, is the one who has since gone on to much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV weekly as a photographer on the TV drama series "Thirty-Something." Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, still haunting people's dreams. One of my favorite actors in this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedy actor, and a truly cool and sincere person. We had a lot of fun working on this show, and I think the fun comes.
