This movie succeeds. As a former USAF aviation cadet, I can tell you that this movie has it all. The boredom of the application process. Waiting for the word. The joy of acceptance The concern of passing through the course. The sadness of seeing friends (perhaps the best of them) disappears. The anguish of paying the final price - the death of student airmen. The glory of graduation. Always flying, flying and flying. Many are called, but few are chosen. We did not pay what we would have eagerly paid to do.
