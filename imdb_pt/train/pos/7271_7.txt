Writer / director John Hughes has covered all bases (as usual) with this family movie "Sunday Afternoon". "Curly Sue" is a sweet and precocious orphan, taken care of from childhood by "Bill." The pair lives their intelligence while traveling through the United States. A. Fate combines with a "very handsome" yuppie lawyer, and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie, as they may relate to the heroine, played by Alisan Poter, 9 (who went on to be the "girl who goes!" of Pepsi commercials). The character should be about 6 or 7 years old, as she is encouraged to think about going to school. Some of her vocabulary suggests that she is everyday of 9 or more. Similar to the "Home Alone", there are plenty of slap-tapers and small punches punching large fat chins. Again, this is a "formula" movie, aimed at a young audience. Fun and moving. Do not look for surprises, but be prepared to shed a tear or two.
