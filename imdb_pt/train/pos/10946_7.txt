Do not listen to the critics who are probably bitter players still sore from the roasting that Silverman infamously gave them at the Spike TV Video Game Awards a few months ago, "The Sarah Silverman" is wonderfully bizarre, surreal, immature, ridiculous and would fit very well in an adult education. If Silverman mitigates the juvenile "donation" jokes and emphasizes the darkest and meanest undercurrent that the show is hinting at so far, we could have one of the biggest cult comedies since the "Strangers With Candy" canceled. But just watching the pilot, it's just comedy, musical, but with enormous potential. Silverman created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier and younger American Jewish version of the late Jerri Blank and the show features one of the more unconventional and non-stereotyped portraits of a gay couple who I've seen it on television. The first few comments suggest that the next few episodes outweigh the pilot, so I can not wait to see how this show unfolds.
