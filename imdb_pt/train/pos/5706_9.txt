If this movie had been made just a few years later, I would have dropped the scoreboard in one or two spots because the sound quality was very poor. Sometimes the movie seems to be a silent movie during the scenes between scenes (the normal sounds of the environment are missing). But since it was in 1931 and a French film, this is totally forgivable. Especially because this also occurs in later French films - a time when sound difficulties should have been completely resolved (as in L'Atalante, 1934). <br /> <br /> Okay, plus some small sound problems. , this is a cute little movie about an award-winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And during the search, there are many little animated songs that you can not help liking. A good all-in-all movie.
