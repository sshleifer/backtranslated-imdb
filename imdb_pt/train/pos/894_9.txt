That, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" are my favorite Sammo Hung movies. Fat Dragon is fatter on this tour than on "Condors," but he's no less secure as a director or actor. He is indeed at the top of his form and offers a devastating and brutal actioner that has half a dozen incredible sequences and manages to tell a sweet and compassionate love story as well. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as inquisitive adjuncts to the action, and ensure that viewers do not press the fast-forward button between physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which features a fun light saber duel, sets a solid yet deceptive tone. A sequence in which Sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweet with a comic and sharp tone. The fast and furious fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp and superb direction, and easily one of the best ever of its kind. The violence of the film slowly increases until finally, when the clash climax arrives, we are subject to some of the most brutal fights ever seen in a Sammo production. The director / actor's attack on Billy Chow and a house full of furious and menacing opponents is a delight to break bones and punish physically. Fantastic on all levels and one of the best martial arts movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Great score too.
