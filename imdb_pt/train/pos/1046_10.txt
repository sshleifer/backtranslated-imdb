Probably my favorite movie of all time, a story of altruism, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it is not pragmatic or boring. It just never gets old, despite having seen it 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas's performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her few truly friendly roles, is a delight. Children are, as Grandma says, more like "dressed dwarfs" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the slow awakening of the mother to what is happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and surprising. If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be "up" for this movie.
