A nice game that offers fun and ease of play and just repeatability. Staying true to comics and providing a low learning curve gives this game something that is not seen in most action cartridges nowadays. In addition, the narration and the animated scenes used (although long animations are replaced by presentations of slides in the version Nintendo 64) make the most of the capacities of the platforms.
