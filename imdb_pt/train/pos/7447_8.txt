The movie might go a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect. It's not a bad movie; it's really very good. If you do not like the show, do not watch the movie. It starts a bit slow, maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be really funny. There are even some heart-breaking scenes in the end. After all the protagonists have gone through these scences get to you. In addition, Jerry explains in his opinion why his show bothers people and justifies the existence of his program. He has a good point. We care so much about the private details of the lives of celebrities, so why is it wrong for these people to also say their private lives on national TV? If they were celebrities, we would not bother, we would eat. Do not we like your guest doing this just because they are poor white trash and reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a "Leave to Beaver" world?
