A wonderfully wonderful film. You are kept in a deadly grip when you get caught up in the story. A successful dentist, Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), is torn apart in a life crisis that balances his career with his family. He notices his former college classmate Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) and wants to play at the base. He discovers that Charlie, who lost his wife and family in the September 11 attack on America, is no longer in touch with reality ... choosing to engage his mind with his favorite music of the past and video games. The former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their former bond. Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), a psychiatrist, to try to get Charlie out of his sadness ... but it is Alan who manages to get his friend out of his deep darkness. Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson's wife. Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie's lawyer / guardian. Also in the cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adell Modell and Robert Klein. Outstanding soundtrack with names like Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pear Jam and The Pretenders. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've never been a Sandler fan; but I found it excellent in that role. In some scenes, I thought out loud ... why was he never approached to play singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic?
