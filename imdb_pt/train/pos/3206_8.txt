I really liked this movie. Kurt can act without speaking, letting the moments speak for themselves. He does not have to verbalize or rationalize his actions, he simply decides and acts. He is supported by a good cast of actors and scenarios, and is able to show us a more human side of the soldiers, without getting to fight.
