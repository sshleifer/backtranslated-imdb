I always liked Kenneth Branagh's versions of Shakespeare's classics, as he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the one that lifts the whole movie, is none other than "the ever-great-actor" Laurence Fishburne. Certainly he made some bad choices in films, despite being a wonderful actor, but in this, we really are given the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy as it is strengthened by Fishburne's well-portrayed paranoia and, moreover ,, finally we have a black Othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and, not to forget, those ardent eyes ...? Branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, Irene Jacob's Desdemona is quite good but a bit dingy while Laurence Fishburne actually raises it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable film. Note this.
