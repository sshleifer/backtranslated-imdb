This movie is incredible. kind of. it really says a lot, or does a lot, but it's a great movie to watch because of how stupid it is. the college is dominated by evil. who hates the one thing all students love, rock & roll. The riff randle picks up all the tickets to the Ramones show, and this movie has a peak with the school outlet, took my riff randle and the ramones. this movie has it all, a bad script, questionable direction, bad actors (ie clint howard and pj soles), an incredible soundtrack, extreme extravaganza, these elements and more come together to make it what it is, a classic. <br /> <br /> note - during the live ramones set, note that the darby collapse of the germs is in front of the crowd. pure it.
