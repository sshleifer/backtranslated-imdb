If any show in the last ten years deserves a 10, it is this rare gem. This allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun. Filled with heart and laughter, this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful and even the drugs were tolerable. The hair was feathered, the music was accompanied by skates and, in Merle Haggard's words, "a joint was a bad place to be." Take a trip back to the greatest moment in American history. Fall in love with the characters and the essence of the town where people were kinder to each other. This classic is on television as much as "Full House". Do not miss it, and always remember "Shake your groove thing !!!"
