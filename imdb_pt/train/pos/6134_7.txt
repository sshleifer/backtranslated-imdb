Some DVDs have me until I have to go out and buy. This was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember seeing him as a child and loved it. I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers that were cut, so I was intrigued to see what they could be. I will agree that the "Portabellow Road" sequence is now a bit long (as is the football game), but furthermore, I found no qualms about the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectful place. Maybe Disney should have the original version (which is the restored version) on one side, with the restored version on the other side, so people could choose what they wanted to see. After all, it's still a fun movie that still manages to recapture some of my childhood memories.
