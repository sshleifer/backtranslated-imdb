Damn, this is so hysterical! Why are American comedies not so written? For those who think that comedy has to be stupid - there is more intelligence and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than on a shelf of novels! Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot. I could not believe it was the same face as House! There are so many great lines and tricks in this series that you can watch each show dozens of times and still catch new things every time. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and puts on butler Edmund. This is my favorite of all the Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is as wonderful as ever as the rather obtuse heart of the series, "the mass overwhelmed" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "When someone messes with a Wellington he really puts his foot in it" and Baldrick explaining how he got his name and cousin Macadder "the best kipper seller" and homicidal swordsman from Scotland.
