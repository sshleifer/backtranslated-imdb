Weak start, half solid, fantastic finish. That's my impression of this movie, anyway. I liked Simon Pegg in the two movies I saw him on Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role here, however, took a completely different turn. It shows his reach as an actor, but even then I really did not like the character as he was portrayed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> There's a kind of humor I call "comedy of frustration." His supposed "jokes" and humor are nothing more than painful and awkward moments. Much like the character Bean Rowan Atkinmson plays. There are a number of other comic actors who portray similar characters as well. I do not want to hit them here, so I will not. <br /> <br /> But be warned that if you're like me, and do not like annoying and maddeningly confusing idiots, Pegg shows exactly those traits for the first time. third of this film. It gets better, though. <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on a true story. Hmmm Maybe. The story of the film was no longer annoying and became a kind of triumph of the "little boy" in the final third. I do not need all the movies to be sugar and light - but coincidentally, as this movie has improved, it also started to be more and more a happy ending. <br /> <br /> It was also a pleasure. to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, play such a masterly role. I liked "Iron Man," but I was saddened by the fact that Bridges' character was a villain. The purely personal taste, of course, as his acting was superb. However, he was a wonder here as the man of vision Greater Than Life, the editor of Sharps. It was nice to see you in a role that I really could enjoy. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed it! I just wanted to get 40 minutes late and missed the start.
