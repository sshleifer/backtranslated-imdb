Jackie Chan is considered by many fans of movies and martial arts as one of the greatest action stars of all time, and Police Story cemented his reputation as the probable successor of the late Bruce Lee. Enter Entered Dragon showed the mark of greatness of Lee in the '70s, so the same can be said about Police Story and Jackie Chan in the' 80s. Forget the Rush Hour trilogy, or any of its efforts in the US - the only movie that really typifies Chan's excellence, not to mention the kick-off of his status as a kung-fu talisman kicking loud and thunderous, just as his film career was that, Police Story - the first in a series of successful, on the mainland, nowadays in Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I have seen many of your efforts - just like Rush Hour in the United States, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo to name and frankly many of them are insignificant compared to the Police Story. In these films, we saw a less simplified version of Jackie, who did not have the opportunity to use his fighting skills to the full, not to mention that the fight sequences were not as good as those in efforts like Drunken Master, Police Story to quote . <br /> <br /> The acrobatics in this movie are extraordinary and are the best presented in any action movie. The shopping mall scene is literally unique and must be seen to be believed: the shards of flying glass, Chan, which hangs just outside the bus by the cane, while a madman frantically walks the streets of the city. and Chan successfully using all kinds of inanimate objects and supporting devices as weapons to fight the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Considering that he is known to hurt and break all the bones of the body and put himself in danger, Jackie's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself does not trust one, is a bit of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially because he has the bruises to show it. Thus he proved that it is not a pony of a trick when it comes to planning and creating different and intelligent moves. <br /> <br /> There is not much to discuss, but what lacks narrative pays off with your end-to-end action and fight against sequences. As for the dialogue, well, it's not a really big aspect of the movie - that's why most of Jackie's fans and martial arts films are more interested in action as opposed to history. <br /> <br /> Instead, say The Matrix, there are no wires or CGI, or any form of computer trick involved. What you see is what you get - and what you get with Police Story is a great epic from Jackie Chan, full of action and pulsing acrobatics. It's miles better than Rumble In The Bronx, Rush Hour and all their other American efforts. <br /> <br /> The police story is a great movie and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is a novice fan of Jackie Chan but of whom are not sure which one they should watch first.
