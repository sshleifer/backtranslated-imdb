I had the pleasure of attending a Pacific and Eddy show this past weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This movie caught my eye a bit when I found an article about it in Jalouse magazine. It seemed interesting at the time, but nothing very exciting. Anyway, I saw the festival program and decided to take a look. All I can say is that I was speechless when the final credits started rolling. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing movies I have seen in a while. The photography, the art direction, the acting and, especially, the direction, were perfect and impeccable. Nothing is 'spelled' for you in this movie and it really makes you think. Something that the vast majority of movies today do just the opposite. The dialogue is carefully crafted, and while this script is not joking, the characters' words are very deliberate and meaningful. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of those movies that deserves a second preview and the more you see it, the more things you notice. It is a very stratified and intelligent film. I'm not sure when or where he's playing again, but a definite must-see for movie buffs.
