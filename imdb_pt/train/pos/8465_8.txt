Booth puts a new twist on your typical horror movie J. This movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story. The director wants you to see what the protagonist sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> The story is about the perception of people who work, live and love our protagonist, and how he perceives the people surrounding him an old-fashioned DJ radio station. The story removes the layers of the main character as an onion in flashbacks as the film follows its course, and from that we learn that things are not always as they seem. The film was performed in a small, old-fashioned studio of a radio station with a very bad story where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station being in the process of re-location. It is from this confined space that this movie thrives and makes you feel very claustrophobic and very paranoid. At a time when our protagonist can not determine that the strange events in the old studio were caused by ghosts or some conspiracy by his co-workers or everything was on his mind. What I like about this film is that the filmmakers make you see through the eyes of the main character and makes you as paranoid as the protagonist. This movie is a very smart 76-minute film, rather short respect.
