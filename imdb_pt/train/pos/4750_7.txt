In Stand By Me, Vern and Teddy argue who was the toughest, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often discussed who would win a fight as well. Sometimes we become absurd and we compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now we seem to be discussing guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It's a nonsense comparison, since Lee is dead, but it's fun. And if you go through what we saw of Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you have to at least say that he would fight well against Chan. In this film, he introduces himself as a god of the martial arts. <br /> <br /> The Black Mask is about a man who was created along with many other men to be the supreme combat machines. Their only goal is to win wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some ways. Now that's the premise of the movie, but what it does is mount all the incredibly choreographed fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a wonder. He can do things with and for his body that no human being should be able to do. In addition, the martial arts in the movie, Black Mask is strong with humor and this is due to the chemistry that Jet has with his co-star, the official police. They're great together. But to be honest. If anyone is reading this review, they want to know if the movie is perfect in the action department. And the answer to that is a resonant YES !!! Lots and lots of bloody mindless action. You're going to love this movie.
