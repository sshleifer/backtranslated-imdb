I found this movie lovely. I thought the characters were developed since I watched, I found myself worried about these people. This is a part of the period that I believe to have occurred during the depression. A single mother, who is known as the reclusive city (she has reason to be), puts an ad in the newspaper for "a husband." Christopher Reeve plays an ex-convict who happens in town looking for work. He sees the ad and goes out to see it. She hires you. I actually laughed as the relationship progressed because I found it easy to put myself in their shoes. Everything went so smoothly. He needs the work not to want to upset her. And she needs his help, but she does not want him to get the upper hand. They dance around the fact that they really need each other. Things start to heat up ...... the big bang. I will not ruin it by telling you what happens. But the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful. I found the story very believable for the time that is happening. I think this is one of the best "relationship" stories out there. Maybe the younger generation does not "get", but if you're over 40, I think you'll like it. And if you like Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time" you will also like it.
