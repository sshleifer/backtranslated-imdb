I was up late connecting cable channels one night and ran to this movie about 10 minutes early - every time I thought about going to bed, something kept telling me to keep watching even though it was a long way from my . Time to sleep. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been another anti-gun film, but instead they chose to examine the after effects of the shootings. And better still, the movie continued with real life - when you think they'll catch the easy, obviously planned output, a twist comes and changes the whole perspective of the movie. This film not only does not follow the formula but also shows how other events lead to and / or affect what happens next. <br /> <br /> I just wanted the filmmakers to have explored the issues about antidepressant drugs. more - the children of the Columnbine who had been shooting were in them for years, and it was scary to see the way Deanna touched them every time the nightmares began. Until recently, they were distributing things as candy and only now do they begin to understand the long-term effects of drugs. It was very comforting to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given a little film, having a relative suffering from a mental illness, I can say that the film was completely crazy in all aspects of mental illness. Bravo to the director and writer who obviously did his homework on these issues. And for those who think certain things could not happen in a hospital (I do not want to tell details), you're completely wrong in that too - I've been there. The script was so real that it was amazing. <br /> <br /> BUY this movie and show it to your teenage children before it's too late. Someday they'll thank you for it.
