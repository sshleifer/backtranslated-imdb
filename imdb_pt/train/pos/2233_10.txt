I saw this movie for the first time in the 1980s and now in 2006 this movie is still one of the best movies I have ever seen! I would recommend it to anyone who looks at this movie. You will not regret. It is well represented, so real and never a moment of boredom. The acting is superb and the location makes the movie look like you are there. From beginning to end, this movie is the kind that makes you lose your attention. The actress does a great job portraying the girl who survived this terrible plane crash in the Amazon and shows how she managed to survive alone in the Amazon. It is unbelievable that anyone can survive under such conditions. That's why this movie is so appealing. The fact that this is a true story makes the film even more interesting and thinking that a young girl could survive this ordeal is impressive. I think this movie is one that I can watch over and over and I never get tired. This is really a compliment as I have hundreds of movies! I would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best I have ever seen!
