I lost my father at a very young age. So young, in fact, I have no recollection of him. In the years I learned many things about him. One of these things was that he loved the Westerners, and watching Bonanza every Sunday night was an absolute ritual for him. I even remember the end of the series, being 8 years old when the show stopped producing in 1973. Watching this show over the years somehow brings me closer to my lost father a long time ago. He has all the right elements to make a show successful; laughs, tears, suspense and even irritates you. memory of the original race of the show, came shortly after the death of our beloved "Hoss" Cartwright, Dan Blocker. One episode in particular, and at the end of the final credits, winked a photo of Blocker, and faded to black, and I I can also remember my big sister with a tear in the eyes to see this. I remember this as if it were yesterday. On behalf of my late father who is not here to tell himself, we love Bonanza.Long live the Cartwrights.
