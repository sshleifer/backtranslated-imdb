WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I am not at all fan of contemporary Italian directors. I do not usually like dramas. I'm not a super fan of Will Smith, even thinking he's a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's a great movie with such an original script and good direction and such a good acting ... wow ... it's awesome. This movie caught my attention minute by minute and I did not even like "The Pursuit of Happiness" (maybe also because I did not like the acting of Will's son who is a very bad actor while the kids generally seem all natural actors, I saw him also last night in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and I confirmed my feeling that Jaden can not act.I do not want to write spoilers and so I do not talk about the story, but what I can say is that this movie talks about love, death and other feelings that I do not like to watch in movies ... but THIS MOVIE is a great movie. If you have a minimum of heart, you will not regret watching it
