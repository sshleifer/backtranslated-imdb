Finally came to see this classic TV movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old VHS, it is a classic piece of horror. It's a shame more of this neglected corner of the horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... the TV horror movie. Recommended for all fans of the 70's TV movie, much like the horror trilogy. Interested parties should get the book on the subject by David Deal - Television Fright Films from the 70s. Email me for a chance to see it ..... it's fabulous to see you again. <br /> <br /> He has problems like many TV movies that have to be quite inventive in the effects department and even in 70 minutes may seem to drag, possibly we are all accustomed to the most modern but still great edition and much better than many theatrical themes released today.
