The more I watch Nicholas Cage, the more I appreciate him as an actor. Watching this movie now (in 2005), I can see that it does not fit the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90's. I do not really think it can be considered a noir movie, but sometimes it's very obscure, mostly due to the lighting and strange personalities of the characters. <br /> <br /> Typical presentations of each of the top three films. actors, who all did a good job with their roles. I thought, however, that the Hopper and Boyle characters were not developed, because sometimes it was difficult to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper is a love or hates a guy type. The plot is really good, and although I find that some parts are very unreal, there were parts where I had to hand it over to the director (ie when he first sees the sheriff). All in all, this movie is definitely worth watching. *** 1/2
