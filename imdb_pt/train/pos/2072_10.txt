I was about thirteen when this movie came out on television. It's far superior in action than most movies ever since. Martin Sheen is excellent, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, he also offers excellent support. Vic Morrow as the villain is superb. <br /> <br /> When Sheen "tests the water" on her Ford '34 (COOL) along the mountainous highway, it is spectacular! <br /> <br /> The ending is grand. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the low vote you received. I think the younger generations are more interested in much of the junk that is coming out these days. <br /> <br /> Good taste deceives the masses!
