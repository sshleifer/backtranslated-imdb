This is not the best romantic comedy of all time, but it's certainly very enjoyable and watchable. It is run in an old fashioned way and this works well. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as the woman who can not overcome her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can not say much to Ryan O'Neal like Philip, because he is, at best, undefined. It may be suitable on paper but this is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I have the impression that some of the characters, particularly Alex and Miranda, are not written with deep thoughts enough. We do not know anything more about them because, minutes after they appear, the story gets heavy and the writers do not tell us much beyond what happens. But this problem has been recovered because Mary Stuart Masterson has a new sweetness like a daisy to lighten up, and Robert Downey Jr. is so enchanting that it melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And it turns out that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for deja vu and flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way, why not give it a try. <br /> <br />
