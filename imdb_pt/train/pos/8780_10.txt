This is one of the biggest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures in American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett has introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In this regard, James J. Corbett was truly innovative. But back to the film, all performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was cute. In fact, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And though it is a play of the period, history stands the test of time; was not obsolete. Ward L.'s portrait of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the great portraits of a real sports figure in the history of the movies and the boxing scenes are realistic, well staged and highly effective. This combined with a great script makes this movie a must.
