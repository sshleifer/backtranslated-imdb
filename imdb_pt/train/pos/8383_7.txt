Robot Jox tries hard, but it's fundamentally a series of fight scenes tied together - robot versus robot, man against man, man against woman. The premise had potential, but it seems the script did not really receive the pair of drafts that it needed. Still, it was pretty good, for a science-fiction action movie. Part of this was because the script was by Joe Haldeman. For those unfamiliar with the name, Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel "The Forever War." It is considered one of the best battle armor novels, with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor". And this movie is actually more like a giant battle armor movie instead of giant robots. It's closer than the fans would like, instead of the farce that was Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers," which had only a passing resemblance to the novel on which it was based. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions, this really is is based on Homer's "Iliad." Two names are all they had in common. Achilles, having the foot of the robot uprooted, had no parallel in the Iliad, which did not include the death of Achilles. The ancient Achilles was not a noble warrior either. He was the most powerful, but also vengeful and stingy. Even the dead robot athlete in the first scene does not fit. He was named Hercules, while the Greek Iliad would have Herakles. <br /> <br /> The effects were pretty good for time and budget. True, it was not comparable to "Terminator 2" one year later, but this movie cost ten times as much. The stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". Better, in fact, than much animation of Ray Harryhausen, which is highly regarded, but rather outdated. <br /> <br /> Do not bring high expectations for this and you probably will not be disappointed. It is better than many other low budget movies and even some big budget blockbuster aspirants who have better effects but much worse scripts.
