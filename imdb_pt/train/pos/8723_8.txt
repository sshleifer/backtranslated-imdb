The animation was fabulous and the movie funny. The two circus insects, Tuck / Roll were very funny. If you waited until the credits at the end, you saw a very funny sequence of film, where they showed the insects pretending to do the wrong things, as in other movies, which was smart because it made the characters more human and belifiable.
