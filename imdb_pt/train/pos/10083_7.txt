The fact that this movie was released on DVD even formatted for TV and with a distorted image really bothered many movie purists ... and rightly so. That deserves much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story is about a street artist who needs a son to convey his craft (the rules of the day) and do away with a little girl (not the conventional way). if they follow. The old man had bought the boy at a slave auction and soon discovers that the boy is not a boy, which he obviously thought was the case. <br /> <br /> The old "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is kind of funny-looking, with a missing front tooth and a contagious smile." The girl "Doggie" (Zhou Renying) is a cutie. I usually like a good sentimental ending, but it gets a little taken in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, it involves a complete story with drama, suspense, humor and sadness Just do not expect a good quality picture for the money you're spending DVD Until it comes out in widescreen, rent it.
