How most out of you may have been seen Star Wars: Returning outside the Jedi You may know it's a good movie but as you may have seen in video They M | can have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with There are no spirits or anything But on the original (Live TV) When they are partying But before I say more when Ben obi-wan dies on the imperial ship Or star of death They saw him disappear And Yoda dies of any age or internal illness But because Luke killed Darth Vader (real name: Anakin Skywalker) When they are all partying at the end, when Luke or someone stops the spirits Ben and Yoda Starring in him and smiling while another spirit appears It's your Darth Vader but not as a Sith As the Old Selve Usual Of It And It Started Smiling With Ben And Yoda I Think It Made The Movie End A Bit Interesting But the Producers or Anyone Should Have Made A Spirited out of Padm√© And Mace Windu And Other Jedi who were killed with Younglings Under There are arms in th and back ground
