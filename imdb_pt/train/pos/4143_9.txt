No, I'm not joking. If you ever, NEVER have the chance to see this movie, see. If you need to cut off your arm to see, see. Worth it. <br /> <br /> Fatty Drives The bus is unlike any movie you've ever seen. Take the trash to the movies and elevate it to a work of art. Although it contains bad scenes, idiot characters, bad dialogues, strange attitudes and cinematography that belongs to the public in Iowa, it actually achieves its purpose as a movie. He struggles to be the stupidest, weirdest, and dumbest movie you've ever seen. And the boy already did it. <br /> <br /> I will plot the plot for those who care about these things (the filmmakers obviously did not), but in fact you do not need to pay too much attention because the whole movie plot is presented in a very long text before the opening credits. In any case, the FDTB (as its admirers call it) is the story of a bus tour of Chicago, which is led by Satan. You see, Jesus is in the city, and all the passengers on the bus must die, and all their souls would have gone to hell, except with Jesus in the city, a footman in hell cancels the work, and that angers Satan because Well, he does not like to look like an idiot in front of the guy, so he decides to take people on the bus to sign their souls directly with him, but he is a demon, so he needs to disguise himself, otherwise who would go on a tour with him, so he disguises himself as Roger and he gets on the bus, where the driver is never called by name, but he's kinda fat, so I think he's fat. The bus (and the riders) are on a collision course with madness! <br /> <br /> Examples of some madness: the title repeats itself on the screen 3 times. I do not know why. A character appears on the bus in the middle of the journey without explanation or introduction, and occasionally sits beside the others, and they look at her as if she does not belong. I do not know why. Two characters fall in love and exchange looks of longing, which are really the same shots repeated over and over again. I do not know why. After Satan makes a minute monologue on the transformation into human form, a title card flashes "Satan is going to turn." I do not know why. A character is a woman who is obviously a man of drag, and is referred to by other characters as "the glamorous Bridget". I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If there was one good thing that came out of my internship at Troma last summer, I was getting my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
