Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not only with Debra Winger's feelings, but with a childhood secret that left them in conflict with their powers. <br /> <br /> There are surreal touches (the fire brigade that act like a Greek chorus singing), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very much like the way American Werewolf in London used all the Wolf songs they could - but with fire ~ and I think I'll never forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting his own trailer as a rockin ' 'to' She's a priceless lady ';) <br /> <br /> Best line missing in the quotes section btw ~' Once you've had a clown, you'll never come back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered the US DVD) and if the comments written by the kind of person who would be happier with Legally Blond 3 do not put it aside ~ try :)
