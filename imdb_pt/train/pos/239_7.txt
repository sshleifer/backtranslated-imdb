I watched this at the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I did not have the best time, mainly because I did not know about Ned Kelly or her story. <br /> <br /> But since this is a biopic, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the way the events are told is true, or if everything is fictitious. But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe that everything is true. I do not think he's portrayed as a crook or crook, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> This is a solid western type movie for all tastes. Heath Ledger is great as always and the sexy Naomi Watts love the screen. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a chance if it is broadcast by cable. Otherwise I do not think I could recommend it.
