The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first. The movies in which she appeared were not very funny and her mood is a bit off. However, I was very surprised to see their true colors shine in this gem of Comedy Central. I could put her on the same level as Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to Jerri Blank of Sedaris. <br /> <br /> The only downfall of this show is its supporting cast. Your sister's character is good; Funny at times, but in the end I wanted to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is extremely insignificant in comparison. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show off her unique, crazy sense of humor and humor.
