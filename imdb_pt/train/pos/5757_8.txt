This movie can only originate in the 70's !! It's a bizarre action movie set in a small working-class California town. Some kind of power plant or mill is closing, so all of a sudden, rampant misbehavior is taking place on the streets! The locals are tired! Then Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent), goes to another city to recruit his brother, Aaron, interpreted by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnam veteran who looks and acts a bit out of balance. He hangs out with a lot of other Vietnam veterans. They come to town to clean it (they become deputies), but under their good deeds, they are actually running gambling houses, asking for protection money, etc. It takes a while for people to realize, and in a biblical confrontation between Cain and Abel, Vincent has to face his older brother. There's an interesting blue-collar atmosphere in this movie, which makes it interesting (note the cockfight scene!). Is Vincent almost angelic in that role? he thinks so well of his brother, he can not conceive him committing the evil deeds he is accused. Does it finally come to your senses? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, is brutally shot in the back and himself is beaten in his home. Kris Kristofferson is frighteningly effective as Aaron. He coldly denies any evil done, and even coos gently and talks to Vincent's young daughter (she refers to him as "Uncle Aaron"), even while he is threatening the life of his father, all the time smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have a good chemistry contrasting with each other. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a girl from the 'salon' that attracts Aaron's attention. This is a good action movie from the 70's, if you can find it !! NOT available on DVD yet?
