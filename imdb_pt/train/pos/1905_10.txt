Quite simply the funniest and brightest comedy of all time ... is certainly on my personal list of the top ten. This one also receives ten solids in the voting scale. The millionaire heir, Arthur Bach (Moore), is a middle-aged "child" who refuses to follow the mature path of life and avoids all necessary responsibilities. He also refuses to leave the bottle. One day he and his personal butler, Hobson (Gielgud), go shopping at Bergdorf Goodman's and encounter a small footman, Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda's chemistry adds electricity to the rest of the movie. There are hilarious hills in great quantity. In one of these scenes, Arthur (drunk for most of the story) knocks on the wrong apartment door and gets his ear breaking threats from a human siren ("My husband has a gun !!!!). those involved must be duly noted: Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Arthur's relentless and loving grandmother, Sir John Gielgud almost steals the whole show with his acid droll-isms (he took home the Oscar for this one), and Christopher Cross provides the theme song (Oscar winner "The Best You Can Do" It is a pity that the late Dudley Moore passed away last month (March 2002).
