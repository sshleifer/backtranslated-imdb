This is a modest comedy directed by characters, filmed in Brazil on a low budget. The premise is familiar, the same as Danny Kaye's 1950s movie "On the Double": someone who, as a joke, makes an impression of a Famous Person, is hooded to personify the Real Person. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two leads is highly effective. Raul Julia, as a secret German-Paradorian police officer, is tall, legal, threatening and Latino. He bears a deliberately obvious blond dye job. Richard Dreyfus, lively, short, Jewish from New York, is funny and friendly. There are lots of references and inner jokes about show business. <br /> <br /> The scenery is clearly modeled in Paraguay. Paraguay was governed from the early 1950s to the late 1980s by General Alfredo Stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father emigrated from Germany. But writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he portrays Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny, with enormous disparities of wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency. Even more in that sense, Mazursky plays Jonathan Winters as an American retiree who is actually C.I.A. station chief in Parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a bite of profanity. <br /> <br /> In fact, the US has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. This is because the country has waged long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The male population was almost exterminated in both eras, but the emerging society was patriotic, racially homogeneous, and strongly united. <br /> <br /> On another level, there is a penchant for feminism in the form of the Madonna character. Performed by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, Madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the presidential pleasure girl at the beginning of the film, but is seen on television as president at the end - now politically and cosmetically correct, with no makeup, dismembered hair A The only time this event really happened in Latin America, the administration of Argentina's Isabel Peron (not the beloved Evita, who never held the post) lasted two years after the death of her legendary husband, Juan Peron.
