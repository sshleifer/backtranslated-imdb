I've never been huge in IMAX movies. They're cool, but once you get over this initial run of "Whoa, it seems to fly!" the movies themselves are usually very trivial and common. The exceptions were the powerful "Everest", the breathtaking "Wild California" and now the "The Human Body" of the BBC, a super dimensioned look inside our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable. This 50-minute film can be 10 hours long, and I still would not get to all the systems working together as I type this review and listen to my radio, and most of us accept everything as guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of a pumped heart (looks like an alien spacecraft), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hairs on your eardrum that process sounds, the development of a baby inside a mother . uterus, and surprisingly, some of the less attractive functions that I thought I would avoid (pimples, the agitation of acids in the stomach ...) <br /> <br /> This film also has a rather funky style, what sets it apart of other IMAX documentaries. For example, we've all seen the sperm find its way to the egg, but have you ever seen it to the sound of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On"? These are creative moments like this that make "The Human Body" not only a health lesson, but also fun.
