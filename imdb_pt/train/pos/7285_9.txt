This movie scared me when I was just a kid. It's not "Citizen Kane," but it has its moments. The arm tear scene is good. The plot is good, even if the characters are not - it could have something to do with acting. Put some people's names on the functions and then see what you get. This was one of those filming, edit (what little there was) and distribute in a couple of months type of movies. This is a classic low-budget sci-fi and deserves only due. I rated another 9 based on movies of this genre and age.
