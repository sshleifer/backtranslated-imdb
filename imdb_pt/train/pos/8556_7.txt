This movie is a lot of fun. It has nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it's fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Another try, but better than the Band Camp and the bare mile, at least funnier. soon after the first five minutes I was laughing so I decided to call my friend and we would watch together. We had some beers and we had fun. <br /> <br /> You will not find any deep messages in this movie, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> So, relax and enjoy.
