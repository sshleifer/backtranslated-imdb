me and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agreed that this is by far one of the best series on the BBC. The whole cast was very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd grade was a bit slower to be the same without it. I do not doubt we'll be watching it again as it's a series that I would never get sick of watching. Excellent viewing and maximum rating for the BBC for such a brilliant series and cast. First rate in all departments and would recommend this series for anyone, although some age limits should be considered because of some adult material. So grateful to the BBC to release this series on DVD and video.
