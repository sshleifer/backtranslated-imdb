This was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many horror movie fans after he directed the seminal and notorious Cannibal Holocaust. However, do not expect to find such notoriety in the movie reviewed here as it is incredibly tame in comparison and looks more like a walk inspired by Conan to a young audience. <br /> <br /> Such a description can instantly set aside most fans of all sorts of Sword & Sorcery inspired by Conan, but before you get in the face of it, it has to be said, this movie is so funny! <br /> <br /> It is touched mainly by ri and features two HUGE and highly sympathetic heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. the Barbarian brothers who seem to be amused by their characters. <br /> <br /> B-Movie favorite Richard Lynch appears as the main villain of the play and it is also great to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> In addition, women are dazzling to look at and wear scarcely appropriate clothing throughout the duration of the films (a basic and very welcome ingredient in the genre!) <br /> <br /> I can say, - this is simply a fun and carefree version of the genre and I wholeheartedly recommend it!
