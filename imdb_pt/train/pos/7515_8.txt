I've known Bettie Page for many years. Her soft-core pornographic images since the 1950s have become iconographic and still have a strong tie to this day. The "Bettie Page" look is still immensely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then. So I watched this movie with enough familiarity to begin with. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was extremely entertaining to see the re-creation of the movie from real figures like Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager ?? all consider pioneers today. Mary Harron did an excellent job creating the desired environment of sexual repression and hypocrisy in America in 1950 along with a sexuality that by today's standards was innocent to the extreme. I particularly liked the use of monochrome against color as a visual shortcut to the emotional and spiritual climate in which Bettie found herself. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol did a great job of presenting the character of Bettie in all her aspects. innocent sexuality and all its absolute naivet√©. Bettie loved to look beautiful, loved the attention, saw nothing wrong with her nakedness and liked to dress in "idiot clothes" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires that all of this evoked were completely lost to her. To this day she still does not understand "what all the fuss was about" when it comes to her photos or her S & M content. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that she is uneducated or too simple to understand that it is just that she simply "does not understand" about fetishism and will never do it. No harm there. Bettie Page is simply being who she is. The film captured that very well. The social atmosphere of the 1950s, portrayed by Mrs. Harron and written by her along with Guinevere Turner, makes me truly happy for me to live in the day and age I do. Hypocrisy and repression combined with massive ignorance of our sexuality combined with a frighteningly suffocating world. The film well captures this and brings to cheer as Bettie bears all with her unshakeable faith and her unchanging naivete. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bit slow at times, but hit all the points that Mrs. Harron tried and hit them well. I recommend this movie, even for those people with little or no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what effect she had on American culture. For those with these interests, then this movie is a must see.
