I have to see this only this past Friday at the Los Angeles Film Festival at Laemlee in Beverly. This movie was the most applauded of all the movies that night. Considering that two video clips opened first, I did not know what to expect, since they were very fast and caught the eye, I was not sure if I was ready to walk away immediately. But to my surprise, I really enjoyed it. I thought the main demon actor was very good. I was so impressed with his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that this was the Witchblade guy. It got really good especially since then! Either this or he was given bad papers or was pushed by the director very difficult for this short. The girl did a good job. I think it's difficult since it was his first performance and being so young. His father did well too. There was a lot of cool cg work for a short, both for this and the short playing next "Mexican Hat" which was also good but I liked it more because it had more depth and emotion and I really cared about the characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was quite illustrative and somber! It addressed real topics using a more fanciful approach to keep people as I interested. We will not even talk about the last movie on the block that I left. My only complaint is that I only wish I had seen more of the demon character and a little less start, and that's why I gave him a 9 out of 10. I also thought the final credits were a little slow. Otherwise, it was beautifully told, directed and edited. The timing was very good with a complete change from the fast editing of MTV made in everything nowadays. There will be more coming from this director in the future, just like the actor. Now I'm going to think of him as the Sorrows Lost actor, not the Witchblade guy.
