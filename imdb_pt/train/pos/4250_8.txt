Todd Rohal is a crazy genius. "Knuckleface Jones," his third and most complete short film, has an eccentric sense of humor and will leave some scratching his head. What the film is about the heart, and it almost certainly disagrees with me about it, is how a regular Joe finds the confidence to go through life with a little inspiration. Or not. You just have to see for yourself. The shorts take intermittent rounds on the festival circuit, so keep your eyes open and pick it up if you can - you'll be glad you did. It's hilarious And check out the other Todd short films also appearing here and there from time to time: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660".
