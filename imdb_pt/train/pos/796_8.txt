Thomas Capano was not Anne Marie's boss, Tom Carper, the governor was. That's the reason the feds got involved, he called Clinton and asked him to involve the feds in the case. I lived outside of Philadelphia at the time, so the case was front page news every day. I also read Ann Rule's book and saw the "City Confidential" segment at A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomaniac (sp.), A super-controller and a monster. He claimed to love Ann Marie, but all he wanted was someone he could control. When she did not let him do it any more, he killed her, the ultimate form of control. I think it's a waste of money that he's still alive.
