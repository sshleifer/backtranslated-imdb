This movie is a great way for the show to finally end. Peter (the puppet Master III boy) is all grown up and now is the Puppet Master. Well, this girl comes to destroy the dolls and learn the secrets of Toulon, but instead she hears the story about the puppets. Most of this film is Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Curse of the Puppet Master, and Retro Puppet Master (sorry ... But I do not think Paramount would allow them to use scenes of 1). Personally, I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would finally be made, but the way this movie ends they basically say "This is the final movie of the series ..."
