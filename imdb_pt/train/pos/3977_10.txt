I personally watched this to see the filming of the 60s and 70s. It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially began and became pop culture and an inflexible force in life. The interviews of the classic rock stars are exciting and fun. You feel like you're secretly shaking your head at the same time ... because it's so good and familiar. I loved it, every segment of 60-day present. I recommend this for all aspects, including rock, hippie movement, politics and good history. I checked checked the box saying that this contains a spoiler, just because I have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regard, since I discussed what's in all 4 segments, so I just wanted to be safe.
