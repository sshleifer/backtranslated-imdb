With a cast of stars so impressive it almost looks like the Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad World of horror pictures, "The Sentinel" (1977) is, however, a scary movie about the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this, she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves to a Brooklyn Heights brownstone that is (and I think I'm not giving much at this time) very close to the portal of Hell. And as a tenant in this building, she suffers far worse than the leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug, to say the least! In fact, the scene where Alison meets her noisy neighbor upstairs is really terrifying, and she should certainly send the chilled water down the spine of most viewers. Despite complaints from many critics about Raines' acting ability, I thought she was fine, more than holding onto scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon, and Eli Wallach. The picture becomes an effectively sinister conclusion, and although some points in the plot are not explained, I was more than satisfied. As the book "Delirium DVD" says, "any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in the tights can not be all bad"! On a side note, yesterday I walked up 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to take a look at the Sentry House. Yes, it's still there, and despite not having the heavy ivory coat and not having a priest / blind nun in the top-floor window, it looks the same as the photo. If this house really sits atop the entrance to Hell, I understand that Hell is ... the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we New Yorkers have known this for some time!
