This was a wonderfully funny comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfect as the parents, and the kids were great too. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, which was a sort of version of Kelly Bundy's Married with Children. The writing and the performances were top notch. <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and that spoiled things. They had to struggle to change the show and bring in more cast members, and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation, but they coped well. James Garner was a good addition. It could have lasted longer if Ritter had lived. <br /> <br /> I particularly loved it when they brought Ed O'Neill into a guest spot. That was great. out of ****
