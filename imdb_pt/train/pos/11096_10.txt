Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a violent and clever action movie. The story: A businessman is blackmailed by 3 criminals. Roy Schieder does a great job since the main character and special credit has to go to John Glover, who plays a kind of naughty psychopath. I must mention that the characters of the villains are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action movie. also features some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are Kelly Preston as the young man beats for Schieder's character. Vanity gives a very good performance and looks like the prostitute who is connected with the three blackmailers. I am happy to say that Ann-Margaret has not lost her yet - this lady is a real girl. Do not look at the rate of this movie. I really do not know what the audience and some critics have against this movie, but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly thrilling and underrated movie. You're gonna have fun, that's a promise. Recommended A +.
