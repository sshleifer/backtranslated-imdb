Soldier may not have gym acting or Lucas special effects, but he definitely does it for me. I'm not going to tell you what it's about, I'm sure you've already read the summary. This is a great futuristic fiction / science fiction movie condemned. Kurt Russell does not talk much, he usually has a sinister look or drone on his face, but it fits the character. There are great scenes of action and struggle; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but that's Hollywood to make believe land we should have to escape our normal lives. I have not seen Soldier 2, but this is one of my favorites. I'm lucky to have a wife who likes expensive movies; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes hardcore / sci-fi movies.
