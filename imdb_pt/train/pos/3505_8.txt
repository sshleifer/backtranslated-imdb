I have no idea how IMDb orders reviews, but I know that, as is so often the case on Amazon.com, there are a number of very negative reviews for this movie that repeat the same obscure points of speech, almost literally. A campaign? Only the IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> As for this movie: it's okay. It's a funny movie, cute and very straightforward. <br /> <br /> It's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, I lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx. But I did not find anything inauthentic or exploitative about these children. Is the grandmother a bizarre character? Yes. Do dialogue and plot recognize this? Yes, fortunately, they do. Are there other films in SLE and with possible Dominican / Puerto Rican children? You bet. Does that make this movie a crime? how would some of the comments (in my eyes, astroturf) suggest? Difficultly. Leave flowers of a thousand plastic flowers. <br /> <br /> This is better than any Degrassi JR episode. High or High Degrassi. Scoff in comparison, but _we never had it_ and I'm touched, in the core, by the humility of purpose and the tender spirit of this film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I would love to know the background story behind all this slander! :-D
