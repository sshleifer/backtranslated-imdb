This was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was also the best movie. The original Sci Fi movies are supposed to be bad, that's what makes them fun! The line "I like my dinosaur meat well made!" is probably the best quote ever! Also, the plot looks like something out of a pot-induced dream. I can imagine now, the writers waking up after a long night of getting stoned and playing the dance dance revolution, piecing together ideas for it: Space marines have reached the alien planet, which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses on it. protect a science team that studies the planet. Best idea ever! In fact, it fits into the full list of original Sci Fi movies: Dinosaur Weapons Medieval Times Terrible Space Travel In Action <br /> <br /> So go watch this movie but do not buy it.
