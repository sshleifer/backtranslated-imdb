Writing something genuine and genuine is a challenge. Knowing how to photograph it and putting it together without making it trivial is even better. The Ishai Setton movie is one of those in which you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty. I was touched by "The Great Bad Bath" and, from now on, I will promote it as much as I can. It's a shame I can not have something to show my friends (you know, like a DVD ???), because talking is good ... but giving something to see is better. Everyone can not go to festivals to discover pearls like this and this movie really pays to be put out there! A big thank you to the staff of this masterpiece, and I'm hoping it will be distributed.
