I saw this movie last night at a special cinema in NÃ¼rnberg, and it was spectacular. I have to admit that the original musical composition of the cellist and the percussion / xylophone player influenced the mood of the film, but the film itself also had strength in its portrayal of the tragic Nibelungen saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent films or Nibelungenlied, I recommend this movie. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were opulent and exotic, and the performance was dramatic and exciting (as is typical of the "tragedies" of silent movies). Unfortunately, I did not see the first part of this pair of movies that interests Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Nordic versions of the story) begins to plot his revenge against his brothers. <br /> <br /> In addition, I watched this film in German; I am a native speaker of English and have a basic knowledge in German. It was difficult to read subtitles (what do you call them in silent films?) At first because of the old German script, so I advise that if you watch in German, make sure you can differentiate your "k's", "f" and "s" in the old script. :)
