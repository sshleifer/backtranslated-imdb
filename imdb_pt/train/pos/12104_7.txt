Well run house old and very dark horror. Good assembly that includes the character of Poe, himself, alluding to the story in a London pub. Although from here he is practically the only guy who took the challenge to visit the house on a private night that runs from one room to another looking or avoiding people, is still the most pleasant. Also, we have the delicious and enigmatic Barbara Steele. There are some wooden dialogues and some unexplained bits and bobs, but it's the super scary atmosphere that's kept everywhere, that one and the super musical score that keeps that movement pretty nice. DVD comes from the USA and has some extras
