I wish children's films would still be made that way; dark and deep. There has been character development (and this is the epitome of the dynamic character), plot development, superb animation, emotional involvement and a rational, relatable and consistent theme. If it were not for the handful of music and dance routines, you would never have thought this was a children's movie, and that's why I give such a high note. This film is an excellent film, let alone for a children's movie. Which brings me to the second point: this has to be the most obscure "children" movie I've seen in a while, coming from a 22-year-old boy. I'd be shocked to see any child under 8 years of age not completely terrified over much of the second half and part of the first half of the movie, and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could find (" Jurassic Bark "for those who are fans of 'Futurama'), and that's what makes this movie so good. Just because the film universally evokes emotions we do not normally like to feel and assume are bad, it does not make the movie bad; in fact, this means that it was successful. Good funny movies should make us laugh; good horror movies should make us scared; Sad movies are to make us sad. My point is, good movies should move you, not simply entertain; In addition, this film is incredibly violent to the current standards of a children's film and contains subjects that by today's standards may not be suitable for some children. Fathers, I'd say watch first. I do not usually say anything about this sort of thing, but I saw it yesterday and it was a surprise to me.
