The photograph of this production with budget of supply is surprisingly bad. The colors are muddy and brownish and the photograph looks very faint. Direction and editing are often uninspired and similar to TV movies as well. * And * at first, the film seems to want to torture its viewers with shocking images of sex and violence. The score of Hans Zimmer is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated and untalented composer. <br /> <br /> But if you are willing to watch the movie further, you will be rewarded with a very exciting family story. version of the Epos Gigante family by Edna Ferber. While at the beginning you wonder why Clara married this idiot man, even your character gains more depth and more experience that someone can judge you. Clara offers the spiritual lesson of the film, a big and moving statement against the terrible events in her country. His daughter, whose lover is the young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career, understands this lesson and tries to live with it. The way the plot was built with the final mirroring the beginning was great. All the actors also do a great job. I was wondering "Who's the actress playing Blanca?" all the time, but of course, it was really a young Winona Ryder! <br /> <br /> On the whole, this movie really made me want to read the book.
