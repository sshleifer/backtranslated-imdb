Modern viewers know this little movie primarily as a model for the remake, "The Money Pit." Older viewers today watch with nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all "superstars" in an easier and less complicated era. Or was it? Time, of course, has a way of modifying perspectives, and with so many movies nowadays really ruthless with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to question the controversy in older films, apparently less provocative. In "Mr. Blandings builds his dream house," there may be more than the public expected in 1948. There are political comments, albeit subtle. Finding a home in the late 1940s was a truly exasperating experience, only slightly softened by the arrival of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the movie? Bland's children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school (which in real life would lead teachers accused of communism). In real life, Myrna Loy was also a housing, democrat and feminist activist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a Democratic agitator: he was married to Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom young Richard Nixon accused of being bland with communism (and ruining it). Jason Robards, Mr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, jr., Would for many years be a very active liberal democrat. Almost the odd guy was Cary Grant, whose shrill conservatism reflected a major political feeling in Hollywood that was already slipping. But that was in 1948: communism was a real threat and the blacklist was coming. Another decade would pass before political activism reappears in conventional films, and not so subtly.
