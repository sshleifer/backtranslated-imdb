I could not agree more with the comments of Nomad 7 and I to HVR. A perfect relaxed Sunday morning movie. The humor is subtle (just the opposite of the slapstick, as one malicious commenter noted). <br /> <br /> But what always ceases to amaze me is the frequency with which I see myself wanting to return to this film several times. I originally copied this movie to VHS about 12 years ago when it debuted on one of those weekend previews of Pay Cable free (HBO, maybe?). I've never heard of this before. I do not know why it was not so well marketed. ??? When the DVDs were released in bulk, it was one of the first films I replaced. A great combination of cast and writing. In addition, the fall of the Montana desert does not hurt (beautiful) things. <br /> <br /> Probably not the kind of comedy for everyone, but what is it? If something like Adam Sandler is in your alley, it probably will not be your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. Humor is mainly in dialogue. <br /> <br /> I believe my next exhibition will probably be about my 12th. But I still know that when I get to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars begin to explode, I'm going to lose it (Ed O'Neill's face is PRICELESS!). Recommended 110%.
