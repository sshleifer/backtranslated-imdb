"Ship Ahoy" was probably meant to showcase MGM's talent. The film is a fun trip on an ocean liner en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the time the country was involved in World War II. This was a typical feature of the studios, which gave the film light public entertainment as a distraction during the difficult times in which the country lived. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Eleanor Powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers. where she clearly shows us that she was a dancer to be told. Red Skelton is also seen in a straight part without much clowning as he chases the beautiful Mrs. Powell on the ship that is bringing them to Puerto Rico. The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to show that he was a funny man. Also Virginia Gray is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, which include, among others, the incredible Buddy Rich, who has some solos with Mr. Dorsey and Mrs. Powell. A young Frank Sinatra also appears as the lead singer of the band, supported by Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic trip that must be enjoyed by fans of this genre, which MGM has totally controlled.
