Another silent film from Hitchcock's love triangle, not a mystery, but very English, very well rhythmic and photographed. Smooth boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits circus boxer "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his sparring partner, in part to keep the beautiful but unstable Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) nearby. There are many actors and grotesque at the marriage of Jack and Mabel, the verger, standing in the hallway of the church, is shocked by the sight of the very tall and very low men of the fat woman of the Siamese twins who, of course, argue over which side from the hallway to sit down, and the wedding party is fun. The rest of the movie has Jack losing Mabel and boxing his way back to her heart, or something. It was another time, with the public in evening dresses and the boxers getting dressed as well when they left the ring. The camera angles, the rhythm, the use of symbols, the cut - all very elegant and masterful. The camera work and edition of the last boxing game is very exciting. Brisson's good looks are well used in this; his smile is not as alien to what's happening around him as Hitchcock's The Manxman, and so it's not annoying. But can boxers have such dimples?
