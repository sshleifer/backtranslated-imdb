Although Lang's version is more famous, Borzage's work is not uninteresting, far from it: his "heavenly" sequences are even better. The train metaphor (perhaps borrowed from Abel Gance's "la roue") is more convincing than the "above" heavenly world. <br /> <br /> Borzage's tenderness for his characters shows Marie's character and love beyond the grave is one of her favorite subjects (the end of "three comrades"). park seems to be everywhere: we see it even when we are in Marie's poor house.I do not think the sets are too cheesy, they are stylized for a flaw.The fair from a distance almost gives a sci-fi feel to Borzage never forget their social concerns: in the heavenly train that rises, the rich can not bear being confused with the mob, but as "chief magistrate" says: "There is no difference here." <br /> <br /> It's not an important job for Borzage (nor Lang's version), but to see if you're interested in the great director's career.
