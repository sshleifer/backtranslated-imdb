The former love interest of Jane Porter, Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his friend Martin (Paul Cavanagh), go to the hidden escarpment of Tarzan in search of the ivory gold mine that is the "Elephant Cemetery" first seen in TARZAN, THE APE MAN ... we only discovered that the two men concealed their intentions ... namely, Jane. Will Tarzan stand for this? It is not likely (in fact Tarzan does not even go through any disturbance made to the "Cemetery of the Elephants") and knowing that this Martin tries to take Tarzan out of the scene only he later finds himself in a troubled world later he and his party (including Jane, who goes out with them after she believes Tarzan is dead) is captured by a native tribe with the intention of feeding them to the lions ... Will Tarzan be able and able enough to reach them in time? <br /> <br /> This film is full of adventures full of scenes involving Tarzan and other wildlife and a climax that grabs the interest of the viewer and does not slow down. The demonstrated cruelty towards animals and the depiction of native people may upset some, but everyone should remember that this is basically fantasy entertainment and should not be taken so seriously.
