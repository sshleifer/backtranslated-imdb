Richard Widmark is a contaminated character in this movie. He is a professional picker. He has been in prison three times, but at the beginning of the film, he tries to make four. Thelma Ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing how the girl burned for Widmark. <br /> <br /> This is a period piece during the McCarthy era, where the Red Scare dominated politics and was worked on in this plot very well. What is unusual about this movie is that Peters and Ritter are both victims of violent beatings at a time when women were rarely more than sex objects in movies. This is what makes this movie noir as women often have different roles in this type of movie. <br /> <br /> The film is only 87 minutes long and was obviously made by Fox as the sub-card for dual features in the theater. . The sets show that it is a limited budget film. The script left J Edgar Hoover mad because patriotism is despised. Hoover wanted him to change. <br /> <br /> Instead, he became a B with a card photo that was a hit in 1953. The script and acting on him are better than other great features that year.
