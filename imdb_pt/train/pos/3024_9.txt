A film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable arrival of World War II when a Spanish Republican sent by his soon overthrown government (Charles Boyer) infiltrates England in search of support for his cause by trying to influence the wealthy owners of mines not to sell coal to the fascists in Spain. He disturbs the locals, being beaten convincingly in one scene and later in the film, facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as a further threat to their precarious survival. Notwithstanding socioeconomic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film skillfully plunges into a shadowy and suspense intrigue involving infidel compatriots played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre, and is cleverly filmed in innumerable dark scenes set in a darkened hotel by James Wong. Howe, and manages more than once to get under his skin.
