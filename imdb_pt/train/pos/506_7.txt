A strong pilot, this two-hour episode does a great job of configuring the characters and background for "Enterprise", the "prequel" to the original "Star Trek" series. He stumbles a couple of times at the convention and in the "Journey" clich√© - the sweet-colored strippers never seem to go out of style, and I can already predict sneaky referrals to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the set looks strong, the characters are well-designed, and you can already see evidence that this particular team will have to be more resourceful in different ways than the previous (later?) series. Scott Bakula hits the right note as a captain with the audacity and audacity of Kirk, but without his presumption and arrogance, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will feature the engineer, weapons master and communications officer (not just a glorified phone operator!) as support players. Writers seem to have realized the big mistake made in "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Deep Space 9," and "Voyager": instead of starting with a big cast and paying little attention to the characters, it's starting with a core smaller characters for which a little more variety can be added later - which I hope will happen, because after about half a dozen episodes, more variety will be needed.
