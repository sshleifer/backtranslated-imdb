It's a shame she did not get credit on the screen, she by far did the best job in the movie that girl on the cross, the best part of the movie. She had far more impact than Avril, or almost anyone else in the movie. . She almost made S / M look like fun! She really believed that she has the S / M model that is afraid of her situation. Although they seem to have actually confused this kind of dreamy sensation of looking for the bad guy, these sets were nicely built, but they just kind of touched the surface of what was filmed. This is a movie where both cuts should be made available. It seems they left out much of what was filmed, and almost all the really dark material that would have made the film much more insane. It's as if they stopped before the mark during filming. What was filmed would not have gotten a R rating probably an NC-17 or X, but that's what it would take to make the film as it should.
