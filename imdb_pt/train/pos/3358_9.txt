First of all for this movie I only have one word: 'wow'. This is probably one of the best films that touched me, from the history to the performances, so beautifully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with the latter, because it really brought depth to the character, since it was a very difficult role. Even so, the two formed a pair, which surprised me, from the beginning to the end, showing on the way, a friendship full of love, which develops throughout the day, set in the film. The story takes some time to roll, since the introduction of the characters is long, but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity. If you get the chance, see, because it's a movie that will stay in your mind for a long time. Simply amazing - 9/10.
