This is a good movie. Something fun about seeing money can be overcome, especially from a child's point of view. Accept what is, a fun movie about a child's dream come true and what a child can do with 1 million dollars. Do not like it, do not watch it. They make movies for observers, not for people who have nothing better to do, then complain about in their lives.
