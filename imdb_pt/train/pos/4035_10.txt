In a word ... incredible. <br /> <br /> Initially, I was not very interested in watching Pinjar, as I thought it would be another movie lamenting about the partition and would show bias towards India and Pakistan. I was totally wrong. Pinjar is a moving, emotional and intelligent film with no visible flaws. I was haunted by it after watching it. It stayed in my mind for so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion - everything was so real. <br /> <br /> This is truly a masterpiece that can rarely be seen in Bollywood nowadays. It has no prejudices or prejudices and has given the partition a human history. Here, no country is represented as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunting. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the acting took my breath away. All were thrown perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful film ... look no further. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. Incredible can not describe how great it is.
