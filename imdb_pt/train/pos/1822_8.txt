An unforgettable masterpiece by the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon. I remember this very well from my childhood, it was funny, sad and very beautiful. Well, it gets a bit dark, a dog that escaped the pound and is killed by an old friend, ends up in Heaven and back. But it gets sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a little scary, unlike other cartoons, like Charlie's dream sequence, but all was well, and the songs were fair. A memorable role from Burt Reynolds and Don DeLuise, I just love this guy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she did not deserve to die, but she is in heaven now, all good people go to heaven. Overall, this is a very good animated film, a classic by Don Bluth enough to embarrass the anime and Disney. Recommended for the whole family. And you know it, if you have the original video of this, you will find after the film, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, you have to love this guy, ahehehe.
