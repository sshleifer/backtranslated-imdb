Great pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients to keep attention - an intriguing tale, a fiery pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who is drawn to the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is on a secret mission. Himself. They make a nice romantic pair on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is the evil pirate who weaves his vile web of division and conquest. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of the young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There is a beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines, ships and the bay. . Much action also of sword fighting, naval battles, daring jumps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). From the burning redhead herself, I once heard in an interview from Maureen O'Hara that she had great mastery of the whip and could also overcome Flynn in the sword fight in those days, but there was no need to put it to the test here. <br /> <br /> Very nice movie.
