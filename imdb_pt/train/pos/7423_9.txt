I recently watched the '54 version of this movie with Judy, and while I enjoyed the story and the music, I discovered that the movie could not hold my attention. I had hoped that the remake of '76 would be the same story except with a touch of Barbra. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern view of fame, money, love, and the price of it all. This version is much more real than the 54 version, with undoubtedly better music, better performance, a more exciting storyline and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous film is in the top 100 list of the American Film Institute, while this exciting remake fails to leave a mark on the critics list.
