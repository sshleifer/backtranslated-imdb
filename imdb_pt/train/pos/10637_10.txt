Harem Suare is the best film I saw in the year 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Sexually filmed and portrayed, Harem Suare is a daring film that touches on the interracial romance, which is a taboo in Hollywood. Women of all shapes, sizes and colors fill the film. Separated from the outside world, women entertain themselves by telling stories about intrigues, rivalries and jealousies within their ranks.
