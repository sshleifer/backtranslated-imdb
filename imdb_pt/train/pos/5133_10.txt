Each of the major studios produced a jazz one-reelers over the thirties and forties (with Universal taking the lead). While most seemed as cheap on the screen as they were doing, Warner Bros. (who abruptly stopped making them in 1946) often distinguished her with unusual camera angles, mirrors, and optical effects, thanks to some creative directors like Jean Negulesco. It is appropriate that the best of this genre comes from this studio. <br /> <br /> What sets "Jammin 'The Blues" apart from the rest of the pack is that it looks more like an avant-garde experiment than a Hollywood musical. Filmed in July 1944, he turns an ordinary jam session into a "turbulent" dream escape from wartime problems, highlighted by the song "On The Sunny Side Of The Street." Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (later to work with Hitchcock) had a lot of artistic freedom, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller, and the studio could care less about the way he and his fellow musicians were introduced. The optical printer is well taken advantage of, with several images of the same artist appearing at the same time. (Norman McLaren actually classified this process two decades later in "Pas De Deux," while the Linwood Dunn team had different effects on "Citizen Kane.") The strong emphasis on silhouettes and cigarette smoke was also ahead of its time; in a way, that predated the psychedelic 1960s, but with a clearly noir style of the 1940s film.
