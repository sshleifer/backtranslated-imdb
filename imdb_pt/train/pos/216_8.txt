Question: How do you steal a scene from the expert scene thieves Walther Mathau in the full, furious and bright way of Old Grumpy? response: calmly, impassively, and with timing perfect as George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about Vaudeville, but this remains a favorite movie, the two tracks are hilarious, the script funny, the direction and the pace very well. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a straight man - trying to get to Burns through the window, etc. Even the small parts are great. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny scenes, Mathau messing up the commercial, Burns repeating his story. answers as if senis ... <br /> <br /> A delight. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
