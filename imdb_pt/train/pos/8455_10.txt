Despite being an impressionable young man when he first experimented with the Gundam Wing series, when re-watching the series, I reconfirmed that this series is not just beautifully animated, but the plot, the Gundam design, character design and depth of the character are masterfully. executed. Although at first glance it looks like a kind of boy band, the elegant attractiveness of the characters can be partly credited to a great art, with individual personalities creating clear and captivating distinctions between the characters. Consequently, it is extremely easy to become attracted to any particular character. Personally, I liked Heero because of his stoic personality. While I may have a sentimental attachment to this show with my childhood, I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper issues of war and life in general (how can we get peace?) While delivering action-packed battles in great robotic outfits. which, to say the least, is excellent.
