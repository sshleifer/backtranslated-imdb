I saw this movie for the first time several years ago - and I was connected in an instant. It's great and way better than J. F. K. because you always have to think 'Can it happen to me? Can I become a killer? You can not turn on the TV or VCR without thinking about the plot and in the end, which you should not miss under any circumstances.
