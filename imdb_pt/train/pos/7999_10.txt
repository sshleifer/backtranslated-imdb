This has to be one of the best, if not the best movie I've seen for a long, long time. It had enough action to satisfy a fan, and yet the plot was very good. I really liked the movie, and got addicted from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Added blood and blood there, but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the movie, and even had a tear jerker ending for many people I should think. <br /> <br /> It's a must-have for anyone. Seen many comments, slating the movie, but to be fair, most of the films that receive negative reviews, turn out to be some of the best. this proves yet again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, just go out and watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.
