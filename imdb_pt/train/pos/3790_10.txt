I tuned this by accident on the independent movie channel and was fascinated. I'm a professional actor and I was amazed at the performances. They felt totally improvised, absolutely without affectation. I did not know if it was scripted or how it was filmed and I waited until the end to see the credits and then spent half an hour on IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss. I see that the screenwriter and director also made a great movie called Everyday People, which I really enjoyed. The shame of the film business is that such excellent projects do not get the distribution and publicity they deserve and live under the radar. This movie deserves to be flown high and proud. I ask people to look and watch.
