This is a great movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of what is familiar, winter, canoeing, snare, hunting and the like. It is easy to consider the relative as certain, but after watching this movie a few times, it has grown in me. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is well known to many Canadians as director Attenborough and screenwriter Nicholson. to expand the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan does well portraying a complex man, a very good performance. Annie Galipeau is adorable in her first big role. The rest of the cast is solid.
