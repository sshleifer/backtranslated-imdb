This movie is light, funny and beautifully filmed. The lightning is absolutely superb, and the colors convincingly resemble Vermeer's paintings. <br /> <br /> This is the sentimental comedy at its best, well above American and French standards, and undoubtedly better than the English ones too. <br /> <br /> Each character is playing, and the interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is splendid, Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series, St√©phane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in his weird role, and Genevieve Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> Last hours before finding any negative comments about this movie, then give it a try and add your own review.
