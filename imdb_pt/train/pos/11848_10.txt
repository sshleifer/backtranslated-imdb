Well, what can I say, this movie really got me, it's not as bad as many say, I really loved it, although the idea seems so simple and rather boring, is not it. First of all I liked the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), this really suits the movie. Second, the simple story and drama of the Spirit catches your eye. One thing I like most is that they did not give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, this makes the film more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now, but? You know, talking about animals is so ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not only the children :), because it is very relaxing.
