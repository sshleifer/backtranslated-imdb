Very good action with an intertwined story that is not really a drug. Interesting enough to deserve to watch instead of jumping to get to the good parts. Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere helps to cheer as well. Jenna in that sweater and those glasses is simply amazing! Worth getting just to see it!
