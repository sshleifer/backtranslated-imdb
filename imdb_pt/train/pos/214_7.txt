An old vaudeville team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) was one of the best known, but they broke apart hating each other. More than 20 years later they agree to get together for a TV special ... but they find they still hate each other. Willy's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to get them to work together. <br /> <br /> A great success in his day and which earned George Burns an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I (a little) liked it. It was written by Neil Simon, so that its non-stop one-liners. Some of them were funny, but making jokes about Willy and Al's senility was not. I also never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way. Also your character here is so caustic that you get tired of it quickly. All this aside it was fun. Burns is simply great to play a card with ease and even Matthau was good at matching it. His verbal battles are the best sequences of the film. Also Benjamin is very good as Willy's nephew trying to get them to work with each other. For me it is worth seeing only by Burns. This jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with "Oh God". So that's good. Just good - not great. Matthau's character really makes it hard to love. I give a 7.
