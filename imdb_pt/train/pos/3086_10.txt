Here Italy (I write from Venice). Why canceled? ABC should have given the chance to build an audience. The cast (with Hope Davis, Scott Campbell, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen recently. We need more programs like this that make viewers feel they are smart people, not irrational drones. I hope ABC reconsiders its decision or another season appears.
