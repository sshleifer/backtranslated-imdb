Four prisoners share a single cell: the dominating transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); The wise friend of Marcus, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat anything in sight, including pocket watches, cockroaches and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the new guy who has been involved in corporate scams and is now focused on escaping. After a brick falls from the wall of the cell, the men discover the hidden diary written by a serial killer obsessed with "Fountain of Youth" who occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this diary the secret to your escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind it? <br /> <br /> I was a little tired of getting into this movie because the only other experience I had with Eric Valette was the terrible One Missed Call (2008), which I consider the worst movie released in theaters I've ever seen . However, much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be attributed to Klavan's awful script because (as I recall) Valette's direction was not the worst part of the movie (unless he chose to include the baby) . Anyway, Maléfique was a good way to regain my respect. . . is a French film (obviously something I like) and happens in prison (which is my second favorite horror scene after asylums). So that's two points to it before the movie even begins. Luckily, Valette had me once the movie ended too. Maléfique is a rather profound, rather complex and quite convincing story of obsession and despair. . . the desire and the need to bring fantasies to reality. Although not a terrifying movie in the traditional sense, the strangeness of its power makes it all very scary. The period between climax and conclusion was one of the best movies I've seen in a while and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool blood. <br /> <br/> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. A little respect earned by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount has taken the rights to make an American remake (surprise surprise). It's planned for 2009. I'm not sure why, to be honest, this does not look like something that would be a great moneymaker here in the states. But, I was surprised before. <br /> <br /> Live La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
