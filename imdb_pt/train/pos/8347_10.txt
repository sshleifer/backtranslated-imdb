Maybe I'm being very generous with the rating ... but I love this movie! I've seen it many times, but every time I see I fall in love again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing grand or monumental going on. But I'm a big romantic and this movie is romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. Scientists make me laugh so much ... I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it. It's such a clean and good movie - and those are so rare now! My 20 year old brother also likes this movie, so it's not just a girl's movie. ;-) I recommend it if you need to laugh, or if you are just solitary and need * watch * a romance, if you yourself can not join in one. It's a good one!
