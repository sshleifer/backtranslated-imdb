<br /> <br /> In 1970, after a five-year absence, Kurosawa made what would be his first color film. "Ka-Den" is a film that revolves around many intertwined stories that take place in a small shantytown in Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The title comes from the sound a mentally retarded kid does when he imagines he is operating a train. . We slowly meet more people in the small community, the two drunks who switch wives because they are not happy with the ones they have. The old man who is the center of the city helps a thief trying to steal him. The very poor father and son who can never afford a home, so they imagine one on their own. At the end of the movie, all the stories are completed, some are happy, others are sad. <br /> <br /> As this was Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that he uses it to his advantage and shows. Maybe it's too much. This movie goes in many different directions and it is difficult to settle down and get into it. But do not get me wrong, the Dodai Ka-Den may not be the best of Kurosawa, but coming from the greatest director of all time, it's way better than 99% of today's movies.
