This film takes place in the 1950s. Accordingly the dead (called zombies) have come to eat the living. However, a company has developed a collar that, when placed around the neck of zombies, makes them docile and perfect servants. Robinson's mother, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one. Tim names the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and befriends him. But his father hates him and Timmy loses control of Fido and things go wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is - among many other things - a takeoff in the series "Lassie" with Fido being a replacement for Lassie. Timmy was nominated for a reason! All of Lassie's famous episodes are made here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido to get help before the zombies eat him! It is also a satire of the Douglas Sirk films of the 1950s, where everything is bright and colorful - but obscure secrets are tearing people apart. The characters wear very bright clothes from the 1950s (Moss is always dressed) - furniture, scenery and cars, especially, are all from the 1950s in hyper-bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitive, there is always something to look at. The script is good - but there are so many jokes Lassie can make. The melodramas are kind of silly, but the cast does it. Everyone here is great and right on target. Even Connolly as a zombie without emotion does a good job. Moss is the best - playing every line for all its value - but never going overboard. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). Satire can be lost on most people, and blood is rather meek. The blood is made so casually and with joyful music playing on it, it's hard to take it seriously. So for some people, this will really work. I give an 8.
