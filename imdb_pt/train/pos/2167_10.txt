I saw this movie in 1984, we started watching "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went instead to see this movie. If you have some conspiracy theory in your head, you will want to watch this. <br /> <br /> The question you should ask yourself when watching this movie is: Do you think the government would be able to do this? (In my opinion, there is no doubt that they could) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give too much information as this would be a spoiler and I think you should see the movie for yourself. <br /> <br /> But just so you know, we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do.
