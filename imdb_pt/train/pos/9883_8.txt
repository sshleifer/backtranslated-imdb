He ran 8 seasons, but is the first, in early 1959, and is the last, in the fall of 1965, was lower than the seasons 2-7. CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after attending the first show of Season 8 in September 1965 because he did not like the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, who had left after the 7th season. The last episode aired in November 1965. The solitary broadcast of CBS in 1966, on January 4, 1966, was reissued. <br /> <br /> I've always wondered why Rawhide did not change to the colored filming last season? Most of the great Farostes of the 1960s had been turned into color in 1965. CBS was broadcasting color that fall for many of its series, but Westerners like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and the last prime time series to change color) on September 17, 1966, for the episode Snap Decision.
