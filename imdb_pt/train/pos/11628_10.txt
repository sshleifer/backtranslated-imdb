"I did not want it to get complicated, Leese. I have to assume she's going to read this." Fear takes flight at 30,000 feet in this vibrant action thriller. A night flight to Miami quickly becomes a battle for survival, as Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her seatmate (Cillian Murphy) is planning to use it as part of a murder plan. As the minutes go by, she's in a race against time to warn potential victims before it's too late. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my top favorite actors. For example, the first scenes at the airport sound more like a romantic comedy: two people are still running over ... I also have to give them both, to make a movie like that. Especially the character of Murphy .. Jackson, who actually seems to be a little complicated like that, he acts with charm and innocent but he is trying to do his job and make Lisa feel trapped physically and mentally. I mean, in certain places he seems to be worried about Lisa. <br /> <br /> A great emotion throughout the course. A lot of movies I would hate to see a prequel or a sequel, but actually I would not mind a prequel to this, what would happen to Jackson doing a search with Lisa. Favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene, because it was so unexpected. There was also a good buildup in the famous 'pen' scene. When will she make her move? There was also that cool change in Lisa from McAdam, where she switched from victim to fight. I also loved the scene where she sits in the food court and pretends to make some ladies search over the food court. How big was Murphy with all his weezing .....
