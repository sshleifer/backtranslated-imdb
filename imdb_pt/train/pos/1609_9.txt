"Moonstruck" is a movie I liked the first time I watched it. I really liked the second time around. I loved it for the third time. Now it's one of my all time favorites. <br /> <br /> Humor is subtle, but very good. The film offers a lot of hearty humor. the story takes place in an old Italian school district in New York. The quest for love for Cher is pleasant to watch. This film is by far the best work Nicholas Cage has done in the movies. The old man's character is fantastic. He lights up the screen without saying a word. The scene with their dogs howling at the moon was fantastic. But perhaps the best character is the one played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The movie's climax is a scene where the main characters do it during a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen. Outstanding steering and wrap.
