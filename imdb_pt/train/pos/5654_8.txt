I watched the show 10 years ago and I loved it !!! I am now in possession of the DVD and was watching the series, and waiting for scenes that I knew were in the show (when Lucas confronts Gail in his house) and realized that I was missing - suddenly I was watching the seduction without the above lead. So I went on the line to check all the BIOSes of the stars and I came across the comments about the shows being out of order. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some comments state "Strangler number 19 and then Triangle 20, when another had them on the other hand." And also Potato Boy 5, and Dead to the World 6, were also reversed.
