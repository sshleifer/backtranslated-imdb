I'm so glad I got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie. I saw him at an independent film festival, so do not expect him to come to your town any time soon. During the film, I noticed that about 10 people get up and leave. Too bad for them (here in the south, people do not like to read subtitles). The movie begins slowly but is so rich in dialogues that I never felt bored. When the action finally arrives, I found myself stuck on the screen as if on a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I also had a big kick from Chapter Titles appearing before the chapters, especially those that feature the characters as they appear on the screen. This reminded me of Zelda (Ocarina of Time) when you face level bosses. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of "video game / comic" movies, then I welcome.
