Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hated each other while they made this movie and in the following years. Brando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons, but Sinatra (who was already upset about being cast as Nathan Detroit when he wanted the role). of Skye Masterson) wanted to be the star singer in production and did not want anyone to be any better than him. He told Brando to get lost, so to get back to him, Marlon continued to spoil the scene in the restaurant where Sinatra was eating cheesecake so he had to keep eating, eating, and eating. In recent years, Sinatra has given Brando the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr.Mumbles" because of the way he speaks.
