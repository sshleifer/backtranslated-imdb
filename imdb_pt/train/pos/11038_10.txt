I was addicted from beginning to end. Great horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump, but to make you go "What the f * ck did I just see?" All the other commentators have made brief summaries of what the film is, so I will not redo what has already been said. I was telling other people about this movie days after I'd seen it, because it still haunted me. I even had a nightmare after seeing it, and I am a true horror fan, not easily frightened by guts like "The Grudge" or even "Silent Hill". What gave me the nightmares was the discomfort I felt about what I would do if I were in that cell with these guys. What would be my personal horror? my subconscious took me there, and it was not pleasant at all. That my friends is what a good horror movie does to you! The best part of this movie is that it's subtle. It's not about boggart jumping on you, alien invasions or tons of blood. It's the opposite. The horror you create in your own mind. The irony of the four characters is that horror does not come from an outside force that claims it's power over them. Simply, men ask for the one thing they want, and they succeed ... but not the way they imagined it. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but they may, ultimately, wish they did not. Sometimes being locked up in a cell is the best place to be!
