There are few comedies like this, in which almost every line and every character comes close to perfection. This is soooo funny !! And there's a bit of satire there. Sally Field is heading to the field of truly remarkable actors and does a good job, if not perfect, with her TV diva during the day. Sometimes her acting is just a little broad and exaggerated, but in 90% of the time it's a riot! In the same league are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately have very little to do here). Downey Jr may not completely convince as a comedian and does not have the right timing all the time but he tries his part which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful. But the bright star here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a real bitch if ever there was anyone with more than one nasty secret (you'll see in the end absolutely stunning!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never seems to be very comfortable on her part. I usually like Mrs. Shue, but here she acts like a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie. But it is not harmful, and for the most part, it is at least adequate. Otherwise, full of memorable lines and situations, this is a comedy to watch whenever you're on TV or anywhere else.
