"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that has little exposure here in the United States. It was probably due to the fact that the film was heavily British in dialogue and terminology and dealt very much with football, that some may have problems related also in the USA. It's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved a lot. more coverage here. I think that the basis of the plot, (after a dream), is something that many people can relate to and in the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" proves to be a good feeling movie with a source of inspiration and very good acting . I was not very excited to see this movie initially, but now I regret not having seen it before. I recommend this movie!
