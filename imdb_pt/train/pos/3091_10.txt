This show is totally worth watching. You have the best talent cast I've seen in a long time. The premise of the show is unique and fresh (I think ABC executives are not used that way either, since it was not another reality show). However, this show was believable with friendly characters and wonderful stories. I'm probably not in the age group they expect to enjoy the show, as I'm in my forties, but a lot of my friends also adored it (Late 30's - mid 40's) and are dying for quality shows with talented members of cast. I do not think this show has had enough time to win an audience. I believe that, given more time, this show would have gone very well. Again ABC is not giving a show with real potential a real chance. With so many shows given chance after chance and almost not worth it! They need to give the quality shows a real chance and the time to actually click and gain audience. I really loved the characters and was eager to watch each episode. I've been watching episodes on ABC videos and the show keeps getting better and better. Although I think they owe us one more episode (Number 13?). We want to see what we can! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if it is possible to save this show from extinction. It certainly worked for Jerico. Some things are worth saving and this show is definitely one of them.
