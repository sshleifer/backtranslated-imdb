The pioneering Technicolor Cinematography (Winner of the Special Technical Achievement Oscar) is really charming. Add an endless variety of glamorous fantasies and a romantic movie dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer, and you'll have a very nice "picture". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the artificial plot as well as overproduction. Uncontrolled acting leaves much to be desired. Still, there were no more breathtaking Technicolor films before this (1936), and very few since, that can overcome this breathtaking visual experience of striking color. Film fans who took advantage of glorious color cinematography in "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone With The Wind" (1939), will not be disappointed by the fantastic work done here. "The Garden of Allah" will always be synonymous with cinematography of bright colors.
