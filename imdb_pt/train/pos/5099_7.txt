The only reason I came across this movie was that it's on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend watching it even though you do not like it as well as the best known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a con man and his companion. The film starts out rather lightly but becomes more dramatic as Coop first plans to use his daughter to extort a considerable amount of money from his brother-in-law, but by meeting the girl and seeing the discipline she would be subject to with her brother. -In-law decides to keep it. However, he has difficulty staying on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley can still steal the scenes in which she is. There's little music in it, and Shirley has only one song. However, this is fun and worth watching along with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
