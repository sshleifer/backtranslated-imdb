This is a fantastic first series. It is very well done and very interesting. As a big fan of World War II, I learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things that has happened is that all the interviews with individuals of the past came back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking this is. It's nothing against the men you see being interviewed in today's programs, it's just that most of these men were not really involved in the higher echelons of what was happening at that time. One of the best parts is the narration of Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about World War II, but really think that only the diehards (like me) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts are not as accurate as we know now. Especially with information about the Soviet Union is overdone or simply inaccurate in some places. This information is now different now we know because of the fall of the USSR. Overall, a fascinating look at World War II and a must see for any serious professional or personal World War II historian.
