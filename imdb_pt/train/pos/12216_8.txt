The film only enters the cinema in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after its official release, and after many illegal DVDs have reached the public. Apparently, the popularity of illegal DVDs has led to the release in theaters, with audiences still coming to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is a great epic, bringing Japanese culture into your home in an interesting way. In a sometimes humorous way, the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, since the regular plays of Kabuki are something he finds annoying. At first the audience may be a bit confused about which story we are following, but as the story unfolds, we see that the love between a human man and a female demon leads to a great story for a new Kabuki play. <br /> <br /> The audience is left in the dark if this is a story that really happened in Japanese traditions and mythology, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told with a love of theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy, make this a wonderful ride on the roller coaster of Japanese cinema, as well as in the theater. <br /> <br /> Let yourself be carried away when watching this movie, try to see it in a movie theater instead of on your television at home. <br /> <br /> One critical point: the soundtrack is sometimes a bit annoying. Although most of it is good music, there are some moments in the movie that I think they should have chosen more dramatic songs. But perhaps the fact that the story contains moments of humor has made the director opt for lighter moments also in music.
