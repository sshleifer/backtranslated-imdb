Congratulations to Fawcett for taking on roles that at the time were considered controversial. To my recollection, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and women's rights and emotions were rarely examined so deeply during this time. <br /> Fawcett is simply a woman who is followed and pursued by actor James. Russian. He is suitable as the obsessed psychopath, but sometimes a bit transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a small role, as does Alfre Woodard as the home mate. Woodard worries about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the rape victim, avenges himself of the culprit. The scene in which she throws a frying pan of hot oil in the Russian is classic, and as the rapist he deserves. She then holds him in captivity, and the consequences must be faced. <br /> <br /> A very real story that reflects the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been raped, both physically and mentally. Highly recommended. 8/10
