This movie is about this weak guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high-tech company called Digicorp. This underdog, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his picky wife, so he decides to become a spy. He should go to conventions of other high-tech companies and find out all the plans of the companies. Instead, Morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and practically being betrayed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent. How's Morgan getting rid of this? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan come out alive? Wow!! What a cool movie! I was completely sucked after 15 minutes watching this movie. It's very suspenseful and you can feel the fear and confusion of Morgan while he is doing his best to stay alive. The scene in which they put this horrible contraption into Morgan's head to brainwash is brilliantly scary and frightening. Morgan slowly undergoes a personality transformation that is not so apparent until you think about it once the movie is over. From a weakling with bad hair and glasses, he turns into a man actively fighting for his life. <br /> <br /> The end, wow, the end is incredible! The turnaround is so much fun! He left me panting and applauding like a madman! Good performances from all sides, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie!
