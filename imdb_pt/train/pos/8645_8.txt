I had seen this movie for many years and it made a lasting impression on me. Unfortunately, I have hardened with many movies over the years and did not expect to be impressed with 'Kalifornia' when watching again recently. I am pleased to say that it is as unnerving and watchable as ten years ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really give this movie the power. The first is your cast. We have a bewildering turn of a young Brad Pitt like Early Grace. Knowing Pitt, like all of us, as one of the most enduring pulsations that Hollywood has ever had, it's exciting to see him playing such a vile and unattractive character. Pitt takes the program without resorting to the white trash cliché or the parody, and manages to remain really terrifying throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is just as impressive as Grace's tragic girlfriend, playing the character as a ten-year-old. old girl with a life experience of forty years old. Lewis manages to evoke pity (for his character's position in life) as well as contempt (for his naivety), but she sustains his performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by such a young actor. Personally, I think it's a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfect as the yuppy couple who unwittingly ends up traveling the US with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is skillfully nerd and naïve, and Forbes seems emphatically cynical and off, but both actors can convincingly portray the changes of their characters as they are equally intrigued, repelled and strangely attracted to Pitt. <br /> <br /> Well cast and uniformly bright side acting, this movie really grabs us through the proverbial balls through its flawless pace. By the time Kalifornia was released, Hollywood was releasing a series of character films that have turned into psychotics ('Single White Female', 'Pacific Heights',' The Hand That Rocks The Cradle ',' Sleeping with the Enemy 'etc). Most of these films followed the same formula, the only variation being the nature of the relationship between the good guy and the villain. 'Kalifornia' really does not stray too far from this territory, but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow boiling thriller, and we're kept on the edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn. When the penny drops, and Pitt loosens up to play the maniacal bad guy, the movie completely changes gear and the last twenty minutes do not come to the end of the movie. That being said, the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable for cold. The fight is over, but the scars will always be there. <br /> <br /> Much of the narration (provided by a somewhat weeping, pre-X duchovony) is a bit contrived. Of course it is to be from the book that the Duchovony journalist character wrote, then one could argue that self-conscious narration should be a nod to the kind of sensationalist style in which most journalists write. <br /> <br /> The film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the thrillers of the last twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the weak of the stomach or mind. This movie is disturbing on more than one level. But then, it's meant to be.
