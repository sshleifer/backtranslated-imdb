This movie is funny and suitable for any age. It is definitely a type of family entertainment. The cast does a good job playing people in the Midwest city of Big Bean, Illinois. Where should we assume that nothing happens, since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) Interstate exit ramp. The site appeals as appropriately annoying and totally unlikely for the invasion of the land by the Martians. But these Martians are utterly inept, though they are well equipped with an arsenal of appropriately hideous and deadly weapons ... including a group to eradicate the Martians as well! The Martians keep their lines and give the right accents to make us spectators and the inhabitants want to help them ... leave the earth. J. J. Anderson, who plays the young carnivorous duck on Halloween, has great lines. Watch this movie to laugh and have fun; thought-provoking it is not. But subtle and pleasant it is.
