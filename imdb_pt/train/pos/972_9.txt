Wow!! Lot of fun! Probably a little too much for normal American kids, and it really is an exaggeration to call it kid's movie, this movie reminded me a bit of Time Bandits - a lot of Terry Gilliam all along. While the overall narrative is fairly straightforward, Miike still plays in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments. Every first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main boy / hero, with the spiritual world and the evil that is following in him. And while the ending has a somewhat ambiguous aspect that is common in Miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-vengeance message of human madness, are very poignant. As manic and imaginatively entertaining as other great Miike movies, except instead of tortures and exaggerations, he gives us an infinite amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folklore creatively conceived via CG and puppets wrapped in an imaginative multifaceted adventure. . F'n rad and one of Miike's best!
