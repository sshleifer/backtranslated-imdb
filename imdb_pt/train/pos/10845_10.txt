Unlike most of the reviews I read, I did not feel that this followed any of the other rock movies (Spinal Tap, etc). The story was more original, although I feel that most people wanted to see sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll addictions that the band kept alluding to. As an American, I knew some of the actors - Spall, Connelly & Rea Surprised to discover "Brian" / Bruce Robinson was in the classic "Romeo & Juliet" of Zifferedi (<sp?) I think I'll have to rent this out next. My wife, who came from Mexico, did not follow the English / British language very well, lost some of the jokes (which I explicitly explained), but she cried her eyes on the scene of the show. music now. <br /> <br /> Funny that Amazon.com has the soundtrack of $ 30 + usd when I bought the DVD in the Wal-Mart box for $ 5.50. for the first time this late at night and have died wanting to find it since.
