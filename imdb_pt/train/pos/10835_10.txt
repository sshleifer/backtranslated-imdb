I love this movie. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again and still find it interesting. Congratulations!! I believe everyone involved in the film and in the script should be proud of themselves. It's so weird, you feel like you're watching a real life band. I would like to see more films like this. I'm glad they did not choose famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because they probably would not have worked. And even though Billy Connolly is well known, he really got stuck in the role and I could not imagine anyone else playing. Congratulations once again, I truly believe this film deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award by Bill Nighy. And when you get to the final scene ..... well what can I say !!!!
