As a long time fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creation, I watched this DVD movie without any high hopes for fun; in fact, I expected to be in distaste for the remote control in fifteen minutes. But instead I enjoyed this production, and I liked it and especially enjoyed how the producers and director managed to tell the story of Modesty Blaise. They have managed to avoid the pitfall of making a (bad) cinematic version of the books with which we are all so familiar, preferring to concentrate on a period of the life of Modesty mentioned only in novels. <br /> <br /> for production values ​​(and I'm not a film student!): Yes, the film was filmed with a tight financial and time budget and maybe it shows ... but it spoils the pleasure of the viewer? In this case, I do not think so. Instead, we are introduced to one of the greatest literary heroes in the world and to a taste of their abilities. <br /> <br /> In relation to the cast: because in unknown territory the only people who really matter are Modesty and (perhaps) Professor Lob. To me, they were totally credible. Alexandra Staden, described by some as being of wood, and too thin to be an action heroine, brought to the canvas the balance and coolness of Modesty; his technique (when martial arts were necessary), but more importantly, he embodied the integrity that lies at the heart of the canon of Modesty Blaise. <br /> <br /> OK, so we all know that this movie was produced to wager on Miramax's claim. Modesty Blaise character, was made quickly and cheaply BUT ... I can not wait to see the next production of this series by these producers - as long as they maintain the core values ​​and characterizations of the original stories!
