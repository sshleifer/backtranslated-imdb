this is what I call a great movie. lives through the fantastic skills of the actors and a simple but human story. there are real characters that can be both funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, like live. the bus driver and his son are collecting people across the country (Yugoslavia) en route to the capital Belgrade. the funny and cruel situations that happen along the way, connect the people and the pigs that travel together. <br /> <br /> Watch and you will remember this for a living ... it is full of humor and Slavic lifestyle. <br /> <br /> And another reason for its magic: it's hard to get !!
