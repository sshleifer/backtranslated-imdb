This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I will never tire of watching over and over again. The cast was magnificent in combining the young with the older characters. There are those of us here who really appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift for any type of production in which she stars. I always make a point of seeing Judi Dench in all of her performances. She is an excellent actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an extraordinary image for most recently made films that lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie audience needs heroes, not deviant mannequins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. Thanks again for a tremendous night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, director, producer and all those who have done such a good job.
