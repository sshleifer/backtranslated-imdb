Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster and a frying pan. . . If you do not care about the genre of psycho-generators or horror movies, and you have a special place in your heart for the crooked, this is the movie for you. An incredibly well-developed first film, "The Hate of the Minutes" has all the lure of popular hits like "Silence of the Lambs" and cult classics like "Dark Army". The editing and effects are well done, better than many movies of the genre. Kallio traces an intricate tale of torment based on the writings of the Bible and Poe. At a time when the big budget, big name movies do not have much substance, the independent film has resurrected this death stroke. If you love Michigan, a good story or a decent thriller, go to "Hatred of a Minute".
