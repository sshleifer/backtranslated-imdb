Why the crap is this movie rated so low?! I've seen this movie more than 25 times, I know every line for this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish." Mostly they are just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. As the movie begins, it reminds us of the corrupt and money-hungry world of overpaid sports, they even come up with a so-called "Townsell." I must cite this part of the film as it is true with some sports begins: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus a season as bigger in the Desert Inn I am happy to finally play here in the beautiful city of Miami. "His agent leans:" Minnesota. " Let's not forget this important part of the film. Then it begins that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize that they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create sports basketball after being challenged by what were probably the heroes of high school basketball. After embarrassing them, the sport will pro in about a year. During that time they manage to recruit their third teammate, Squeak, who is actually a day after they invented the game. As the movie follows, we find that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. The story follows with zany blackmail, the cheerleaders of Milwaukee Beers, and such absurd humor that will leave you crying for more. Look, man, it's hilarious.
