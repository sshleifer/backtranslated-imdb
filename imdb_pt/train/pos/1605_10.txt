"Moonstruck" is one of the best films of all time. I own this movie on DVD! The film deals with a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's brother (Danny Aiello) (Nicholas Cage), who works in a bakery. I'm happy that Cher won an Oscar for this movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great too. The direction of Norman Jewison (who directed "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh at. Unmissable! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
