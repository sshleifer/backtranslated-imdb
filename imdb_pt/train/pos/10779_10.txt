A classic design, always fun and fun. It has an interesting storyline complete with adorable characters. Road Rovers is a sight worth seeing, there are 13 short episodes and if you get a chance to see it, you should. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that contains all 13 episodes. I would definitely buy it if they did, and if they did, you should buy it too. if you have kids who like dogs, they will love road travelers! Road Rovers should have received more attention while it was being broadcast, it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated far more than it was.
