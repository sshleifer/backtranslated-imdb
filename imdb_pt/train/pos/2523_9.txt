When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I realized that it is for real. The few reviews I read that were not made by glaring fangirls were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I was given the opportunity to watch it, I was fully prepared to moan, shudder, and need to close my eyes to avoid foolishness. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised, and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has its moments of cheese, camp and general dorkiness - I think it's kind of impossible to avoid when it comes to Gackt Camui, a man not known for his sanity - but on the whole, it was totally enjoyable. <br /> <br /> No, it's not a genius movie job, but it's very, very sincere, fun, with fun choreography, a touching soundtrack and a fun cast. I know little of Japanese cinema, so I can not judge the acting, but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a foreign language or a dialect strange to them at one time or another and that some of them almost have no experience of acting, quite impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, watch this movie. At least rent it since it's coming to Region 1. <br /> <br /> On a separate note, there is no homosexual / homoerotic content in this movie. I did not even see much of a subtext. Do not let people who read a lot of things ruin it for you.
