Guys and Dolls is a unique piece based on the characters. Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) is a high-class player who makes a bet with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs the money so he can run his garbage game and make a fortune. The bet was that Sky would not be able to take any girl to Havana, Cuba and the "doll" he chose was Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons), who was in charge of a missionary. The sky finally bribes <br /> <br /> Sarah enough to go to Havana with him. They end up falling in love with each other, but then she accuses him of something he had no participation. Nathan played a fucking game on the missionary the night they left. Nathan's 14-year-old fiance Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) disapproves of Nathan's game and tries to stop him from doing so. However, when the film ends, everything ends happily with a double marriage. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are wonderful, no matter who sings. Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no voice at all and it's true that they could have nicknamed him, but it did not really matter. He did a wonderful acting job (obviously, since it's Brando) and played his character very well. I saw some movies with Jean Simmons and I thought this movie was the weakest of them, she also could not sing. However, the chant is composed by Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also on the original Broadway production of Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a wonderful voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like music, and even if you do not like it, I recommend you watch it.
