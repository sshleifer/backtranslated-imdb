I have not seen this movie for years, so my knowledge is a bit rusty. I remember thinking that this movie is twice the Braveheart movie. It is simply more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks like someone who imagines Rob Roy, messy hair and beard in simple clothes. Also Liam Nesson has a Celtic look on him, he looks like a Scot and, more importantly, looks like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that annoys some people, but compares it to Mel Gibson as William Wallace. Gibson is supposedly playing a man whose legend has him described as a 6-foot-7 giant while Gibson is almost a foot down. The story contains a bit of romance, conspiracy and a story of underdog. Sounds like Braveheart? But instead of a movie that claims "freedom," freedom, and nationalism, we have a film about honor, love, and justice. This makes a movie more interesting. Much like the Gladiator. The cast is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this venture. The story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity. The scene in which Mary is raped and she leaves the house ablaze with a look of true Scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic. This is something a heroine in Braveheart would never do. Overall, this is a stunning and almost flawless watch. Go and see!
