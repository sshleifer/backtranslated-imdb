At two hours and fifteen minutes, this is a thoughtful film, sometimes slow, interrupted by vast battles of swords. The battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motive of the scorching sun and is superbly demonstrated by a threefold struggle between "demons," thugs and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse. <br /> <br /> Be prepared: after an amazing sword fight under a sky full of lightning, the end of this image will make you scratch your head in bewilderment.
