Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone's last action film before becoming such an understated actor. It's about a climber who must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries who want them to find three suitcases over 100 million dollars. It has great action sequence, edge of its fun seat and a great moment in the cinema.
