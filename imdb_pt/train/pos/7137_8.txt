The plot of GOODNIGHT MR TOM on paper makes it look like we're in a big dose of sentimental sentimental. But the talented director Jack Gold is an expert at touching the emotions in the right way, and instead comes as an attractive, deeply moving war drama with outstanding production and leadership performances. One of the best, if not the best TV movies of 1990s, which would have been even more successful had it been released in theaters. Evacuation of children to towns and villages within the Second World War was obviously a common practice, but in the case of the boy here was doubly important because of a miserable family life in the capital of the Kingdom United. The horrors of war, however, are not derived from the front of the house, and building the film to the end of its throat and into misty eyes leaves us with a sense of optimism, despite what happened before. It is almost (but not totally) worthy of comparison with the film. finale to is a wonderful life (1946). All in all, a modern classic.
