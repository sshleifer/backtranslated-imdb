the most incredible combination of love and psyche of two young men. The most sublime and definite touch of his heart. A rare combination in which the sequence overcomes the prequel in both the narrative and the intensity of the emotions. The film reaffirms its faith in the love and pain of separation. the joy of seeing your beloved is incomparable and everything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have written timeless characters so simply that it gives the film pure joy and love to watch. A must see the movie for all people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic movie (at least one of them) of all time.
