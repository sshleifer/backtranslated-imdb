I originally got it back in 1996 in its one week at a movie theater. I was impressed by this and my feelings did not change much. <br /> <br /> Documentary about the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr. covering his life and films. There are interviews with people who have worked with him or met him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with movie clips or some bizarre recreations. It's interesting (a little), but was that really necessary? I've seen all of Wood's films and they're terrible. Wood had ambitions, but not a little talent for accomplishing them. I would not say he was the worst director ever, but he's down there. Do we really need a documentary about a very mediocre filmmaker? I like the fact that they did not try to make Wood a kind of saint. More than some of the interviewees (especially Lugosi Jr.) practically hated the man and he comes loud and clear. They also totally ignored their films in the adult film industry in the 60s and 70s. It's still interesting if you're a fan of Wood. The best interviews are with Vampira (who separates Wood) and Dolores Fuller (a long-time girlfriend).
