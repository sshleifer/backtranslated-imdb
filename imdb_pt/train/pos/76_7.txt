Vincent Price's follow-up to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the film that cemented its reputation as an icon of terror, similarly revolves around a bitter? though ingenious? show man. Although a remake, the first (shot in Technicolor) remains the top effort; That said, in addition to some comic and resilient relief, the obligatory recourse to cheap tricks (it was another 3-D showcase) and occasional narrative flaws (what happened to the missing purse that allegedly appeared in some police station containing a severed head?) this offers more than enough Grand Guignol-like emotion and overall value of the camp (Price masks him with a variety of disguises as an inventor of illusions embodying missing "stars" who had taken advantage of his genius) to stand out on his own . foot. By the way, does Brahm's involvement here prove no coincidence? since the narrative incorporates elements of two horror titles (both starring Laird Cregar), he had already directed, for example, THE LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young protagonists are played by Mary Murphy (as Price's assistant and naive) and Patrick O'Neal (as his detective-curiously, he himself would take the lead in a similar play, CHAMBER OF HORRORS [1966], which I only acquired in time to serve as an encore for this). An interesting side-line is the adoption of a new fingerprint-detection technique that is crucial to causing Price to fall (predictably but somewhat clumsily), although the persistent gossip of her amateur crime novelist has at least much to do with this in the long run! Watching the star on a tailor-made paper, does the movie emerge a lot of fun? particularly in a compact 73 minutes.
