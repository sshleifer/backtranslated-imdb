This family history of an older man / younger woman is surprisingly harsh. Motorcyclists, hippies, free-love, and chain-baiting blend surprisingly well in this neglected black-and-white indie effort. Lead actress Patricia Wymer, as "Candy," gives the best performance of her career (covering all three "drive-in" epics). Wymer was precocious and attractive in THE YOUNG GRADUATES (1971), but does a more serious performance in THE BABYSITTER. Occasional violence and periodic nudity are somewhat surprising, but well treated by the director. Leads Wymer and George E. Carey sell the May / December novel credibly. There are enough resemblances between the nanny and the young graduates so someone wonders if the same director also directed the last film. Patricia Wymer, where are you? Coming from Seattle, WA, Miss Wymer appeared as a dancer on the MALIBU U TV rock and roll show, before embellishing the cover (as well as appearing in an eight-page spread) of the issue of August of 1968 of "Best for Men", a magazine of good taste for adults. She also appeared as a coven witch on the popular 1969 shooter THE WITCHMAKER. <br /> <br /> BABY-SITTER finally made its home video debut as part of the BCI DRIVE-IN set of eight movies. CULT CLASSICS vol. 3, available on Amazon.com and some retail stores, such as Best Buy.
