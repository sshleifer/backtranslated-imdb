What can I say about this movie? I've seen this a few times since the first time I was about 6 years old. I saw the English version and it's fine. It's a great movie for all ages, but it's more aimed at kids. I love childish humor and appreciate it. If you have not seen it, you should try to rent a copy, you will not be disappointed!
