Several years ago, the Navy kept a close eye on the production of "Men of Honor," a film based on the experiences of the service's first black boss struggle to overcome virulent racism. Always eager to support films showing the best side of our US Navy. Nimitz and two helicopter carriers, supported by ground installations, were provided to complement this captivating tale of the battle of a young sailor with uncontrollable rage. Part of the film was filmed aboard the USA. Bellwood Wood. Antwone Fisher wrote Denzel Washington's directorial debut, in which he stars as a navy psychiatrist treating Fisher, played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is an obviously brilliant enlisted man assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), an assault platform for front-line helicopters. Fisher can not help throwing his own attacks at the slightest provocation of his enlisted colleagues. Sent to the MD as part of a possible pre-separation procedure, Fisher slowly opens up for the black psychiatrist, revealing a terrible childhood of great neglect and tremendous brutality. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds as Fisher cautiously but increasingly relies on his doctor and has the courage to seek a love interest, a sailor named Cheryl, played by an incredibly beautiful Joy Bryant. Fisher reluctantly engages the doctor, asking long questions, but soon realizes that he must seek the answers, however painful, to grow and move away from destructive behavior in search of conflict. <br /> <br /> Although all the main characters are black, this story transcends race while showing firmly the evil of exuberant religiosity. and concomitant hypocrisy in adoptive family settings. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in several recent films, is an image of gloomy immorality, but it is nothing compared to the adoptive mother, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who in short, but searing scenes would win if she existed - the Oscar for the brutality that spoils the movies. The films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (all this transference and countertransference material), but Fisher's sincerity and his doctor / mentor are realistically exciting. It's a good story, well told. Period. Although set in the Navy, "Antwone Fisher" is in no real sense a service story as was "Men of Honor," an excellent film that dealt with overwhelming racism directed against a real person. . Nor is it really a movie about blacks. It is about surviving the terrible experiences of childhood and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still "standing." Persecutors shrink in size and importance when a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the help of an attentive physician. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that Washington is a lieutenant commander, but it is addressed to him. as commander. With all the Navy support people listed on the final credits, someone should have told the Washington Director that his character, like all naval officers below the commander's post, is treated as "Lord." Not a big critic, is it? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie is playing in so few cinemas. It deserves wide distribution. Derek Luke may well be nominated for an Oscar. 8/10. <br /> <br />
