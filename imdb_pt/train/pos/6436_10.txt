Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900 Paris, who is pursued by the most popular general of France and a glamorous earl - and who is at the top of being hired by a shoe mogul. Such is the flawless premise that draws one of the most delirious plots in movie history. There are political machinations behind the scenes by the general's manipulators, a downcast ballooning and ecstatic Bastille Day, but the heart of this wonderfully photographed film is the frantic upstairs / downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and aristocrats only slightly more restrained. Yes, it's the Redux of the rules of the game. Before it all ends, even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, appears as a gypsy capo, not less! Things happen a little thick and fast by the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck - Elena and her men is another deeply human masterpiece of Renoir.
