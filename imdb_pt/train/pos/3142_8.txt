In what is a truly diverse cast, this show is a success on FOX. It's the kind of sitcom that grows in you. If you just watch a program, you may not like it very much, but after watching two or three, you get hooked. <br /> <br /> This is because some jokes are played and others lose depending on how you see them. . As usual today, the themes are very mature. The mood is usually very mature as well. Often the funniest parts are the parts where mature themes collide with the innocent. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith), a veteran actor, makes a great kind of unimpressive humor in this show. Debra Jo Rupp also plays well in this cast. Danny Masterson, the older actor of the "boys" is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) seems best in the early shows as a natural redhead (who had the idea of ​​making her blonde?). She shows very good talent and comic timing frequently. She looks good without makeup, too. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best sitcoms on FOX in the sitcom department and is the most successful live action since Married With Children.
