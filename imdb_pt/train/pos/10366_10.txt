A "10." unqualified The level of writing and acting in this Australian film is reminiscent of the best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill combines with Streep line for line and take for take - is one of the best showcases of his prodigious acting talent and he is in his best sexy and stunning style despite the intensity of his role. This captivating movie is a treat for any movie fan who loves an exciting court drama portrayed in the most human terms but without sentimentality. The film - which has won several major awards in Australia - has not only a superlative cast and director, but wonderful and authentic Australian locations. This proves that people are the same all over the world. And after all these years, people still delight in repeating the famous Streep line, accent and all: "A dingo ate moy baby!" Including this imp "Elaine Benis" in "Seinfeld".
