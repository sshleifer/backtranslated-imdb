David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film. Now many people, upon discovering this fact, would not bother to watch it. It's unfair to say the least. David made his name on the x-files and is a decent actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a doctor addicted to drugs by negligence. By pure accident he becomes a private physician to billionaire criminal Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI has an interest in using Eugene to capture Blossom. Angelina Jolie is climbing to the supporting role of Clare-the Moll gangsters. It performs solidly. Timothy Hutton, who plays Blossom, is superb and plunges deep into his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many would think, and in the end I would rate his performance credibly. His familiar monotonous tone and serious face are present, but they do not hurt the film much.
