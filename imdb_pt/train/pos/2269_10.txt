I recently read the novel "Night Mother", I've owned the DVD for some time, and watched it from time to time. Few movies I have and have made me think and question as much as Mother Night, I am amazed by the brilliance not only of Vonnegut, but also of the translation of his text to the screen. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or watch this movie on VHS, it should be made on DVD, and must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the film. To see how they had a rather simple but complex story in their substance and dialogue, and that worked so well, I think any viewer will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The omissions in the film are few of the text, and it does not diminish much, the film may very well be the book, and it is the best adaptation I have ever seen. I recommend both the book and the film together that it is a disservice to say just to watch it. <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do.
