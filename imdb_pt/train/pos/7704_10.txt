Certain elements of this film are dated, of course. An all-white male crew, for example. And like most Pre-Star Wars Science Fiction, it tends to take too long to admire. <br /> <br /> But still, no movie has ever caught the taste of the Golden Age's Science Fiction like this, even down. to the use of "electronic tonalities" to provide the musical score. Robbie the Robot synthesized robots Asimov, and was the inspiration for everything that followed, from C3PO to Data. <br /> <br /> The plot, of course, is "The Tempest" by Shakespeare. Morbius is Prospero, an exiled magician who finds his kingdom invaded by intruders ... It was a film that treated science fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
