I sat down to watch "Midnight Cowboy" thinking it would be another overrated movie from the 60s / 70s. Some of my favorite movies come from the '70s, in the same style as "Midnight Cowboy" ("Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park", etc.), but there are many, many overrated as well who won strong reputation among critics for being innovative - unfortunately, the vast majority of them do not hold up as well today. I kind of feel like this about "Easy Rider". (Although it's also one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> So, I did not expect much from "Midnight Cowboy", but I won a lot back. It's a moving story, well done and well told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best - sometimes it's a bit funny (he looks like a cartoon character when speaking - maybe because of Lenny's / "Simpsons" connection), but Hoffman is totally convincing . Half of the film's budget went to his salary when he was becoming a big star in Hollywood. In front of him is Jon Voight, the second-billed Joe Buck, the "cowboy" who travels north of the Big Apple, hoping to become a prostitute. Soon, his naive manners get him in trouble and he partners with a crippled cheater named "Ratso" - who offers himself as "manager" of Joe for a certain percentage of the profits. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long. at two o'clock, but it never seems too long. Some movies tend to drag on, especially some of the films that were made in the '70s because (as has been said in "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls") the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally a little passionate about their material , examining characters / scenes / etc. this is not important. Just the only scene I felt was a little long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated (similar to the odyssey drugs in "Easy Rider") and actually detracts from its flow because it's not necessary. /> <br /> Other than that, "Midnight Cowboy" is an almost perfect movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It has its flaws (flashbacks are a little tacky and never been used as well as they could be, for example) and some of the scenes are a bit uncomfortable (like the sequel to the gay movie), but if you can handle your content "Midnight Cowboy" is a great film, an uncompromising examination of street life in the late 60's and early 70's. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards it may seem a bit outdated and cumbersome from the liberal perspective of "life is horrible, etc." ... but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 1970s. (It was technically released in late 1969, but I still classify it as a 1970s film. It also won the Oscar for Best Picture, being the first - and the only - censored film X to do so. R on appeal.) <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5
