The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal kind of love between Hollywood romance / comedy comedy. <br /> <br /> I usually do not like this kind of movie and this tiring story, but this is refreshing, fun to see and overflow with charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each of them. other good and make a couple very beautiful. The supporting cast is excellent - from the always pleasant Felix Bressart to villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've seen in his career. He takes the film and turns it into a completely different mood for some time when something dramatic happens to him. This "twist" is another reason why this film rises above others of its kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a movie has a good combination of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a great example of this. In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done. I'll take this to re-make "You've Got Mail" any day. Without comparison.
