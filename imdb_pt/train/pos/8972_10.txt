My discovery of the cinema of Jan Svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole Czech animation tradition, of which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. Your Ruka is one of the finest and technically most impressive animation films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> A potter wakes up and waters his plant. Then he'll make a pot. But there comes the huge hand that breaks the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of himself. He throws his hand out but soon returns and imprisons him in a cage where he is forced to carve a stone hand. He defines it, fainting from exhaustion, but eventually completes the task. In a marvelous sequence of metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn his ropes of visible puppets, which keep him in bondage, and he flees back home. He closes and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic (why?) The hand, for example, is clearly the hand of someone in a glove. Everything else is clay. The strings are visible and are part of the narrative, becoming a precursor to the movie Strings. The atmosphere is strange: that hand that goes behind the little potter managed to instill more terror in me than many combined horror movies. <br /> <br /> The film is obvious, but avoid being totally manipulative because of its simplicity. is a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny that does not help win the heart and mind of those who hold freedom as a natural right.
