The Baghdad thief is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story. Although the primary exposure of my four children to this tale, the most famous of the Thousand and One Nights stories, comes from Disney Corporation, the Baghdad thief kept the interest to the end. The story is progressing well and includes a turnaround or two that reduce predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, is also up to any of today's teenage actors in appeal, judging by the number of times I've heard my eldest daughter say, "He's c-u-t-e!" <br /> <br /> In 1940, the film won the Oscar for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, these effects seem very old-fashioned ("Look, it's Barbie flying through the air," my daughter declared when she saw the flying genie). However, they fit well into the story. The film is over 60 years old. The effects fit the script. In addition, what is seen in The Thief of Bagdad remained practically in the state of the art for the next twenty-five years. Just compare the initial setup of a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this. In that, it was a great achievement. <br /> <br /> This qualifies as a family movie, although there are some stabs near the end. The acting is as obvious and the wounds as bloodless as the scenes almost as artificial as animation. <br /> <br /> In short, a fun movie that is worth watching for both a night of pure entertainment and historical value. effects. I recommend.
