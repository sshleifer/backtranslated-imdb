With the current trend of gross humor, this movie is the grandfather of them all. While some of the humor is dated, each sketch will shock, repel or make you laugh out loud. The most memorable is the comment of sex games and of course the commercial VD. It does not always work, but it pays off when that happens. I give it to 7.
