For me, the final scene, in which Harris responds to the press, is worthy of seeing this clever and timeless piece of politics (especially the campaign phase). If only the "real life" pols responded intelligently and articulately, as Harris did, then the arrogant, self-interested members of the press might think twice before reaching the irrelevant, conflicting "junk" that has absolutely nothing to do. do with a candidates ability to effectively deal with the challenges of the office for which he / she is seeking.
