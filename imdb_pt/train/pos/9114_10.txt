Considering the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). The idea offers a multidimensional view of a community assigned to hoods and resellers. But the funny thing is that this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short. But it is the most persistent unspoken affirmation of independence of these themes. The genre is unique and not the typical expectation. It is almost this game that draws attention, so seeing it twice is key. The film has an aesthetic quality that lends itself to the true art of cinema. <br /> <br /> And it is this true art that, with an African voice, is extremely rare. The film does not copy to reach its message, it innovates and provokes, pulling the subtle stereotypes (not racial stereotypes, but based on personages). From the writers' point of view, the film is brilliant. It carries multiple messages, which include a very fast character development. It must be remembered that this film is less than 10 minutes and manages to establish character very quickly. The use of color texture and music should also be commended. But considering the director, Owen Alik's latest venture Shahadah 500 Years Later, music is expected. But from the point of view of a theme, it seems that the idea is a departure, but the satire indirectly deceives a social problem - brilliant things!
