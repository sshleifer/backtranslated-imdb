Pakeezah has a very interesting story (which is well documented in the 'Trivia' section) about how it came about. It seems that fate conspired to test Kamal Amrohi (the director) while at the same time secretly wanted to see him complete his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah rides on metaphors, poetry and visual utterance. As a result, the intensity with which emotions emerge reaches a dimension that may not be very real but is very effective and impacts the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan as herself. The other stars of the film, besides her, are Ghulam Mohammed (musical director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background soundtrack) and Joseph Wirsching (d.o.p). Your music and cinematography fascinates you. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. It reveals new layers to you every time you watch again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare movie poets and he left us a gift.
