I gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent film but because of its sheer ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of a woman's fight against all odds is already an old cliche, but very few movies carried her with as much affection and sincerity as The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> showed a different side of the African-American experience - showing that after slaves gained freedom, many fell in the way of the hated "white man" and abused their own people. I think that's an important point, because it goes against the tendency to portray the white about black violence and win an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Also the performance performances are superb - especially Oprah which I now take a new respect for. <br /> <br /> Worth watching - but keep some fabric handy.
