A good movie with - for its time - an intense, sprawling, somewhat dark, somewhat reminiscent story of John Ford's "The Searchers," though not as brutal. The story begins quickly and does not abate, with several very good dialogue scenes between Jeff Webster, Stewart, Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This film is somewhat reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a work by Mann-Stewart, but I found it much less sentimental and more interesting. There are some caveats: a very fast end (and quite sentimental); Corrine Calvert, 24, is not very convincing as a na√Øve French teenager, and of course the film takes place in the Mythical West, a land of fables where the actual laws of nations and physics do not apply. But these are trivial concerns. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark and ungainly man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountainous landscape can not be overcome. A beautiful drama of Western customs.
