When you see this movie, you begin to realize that a drastically underused asset was the late Dudley Moore. There should be a dozen movies like this in our archive. <br /> <br /> He was a first-rate talent before going to Hollywood, both as a comedian and as a musician. But mostly he is remembered for his pair with Peter Cook on television and in one or two indifferent British films. Perhaps the best of them was "Bedazzled." <br /> <br /> He has always tended to be eclipsed by Cook, who is jealous of his partnership and allowed Moore to realize his true potential in America. 'Arthur' is the result. <br /> <br /> This is a truly splendid movie. Moore's clownish comedy as a drunk is undeniable. The script is perfectly fit in its own way, with many hilarious and almost surreal conversational digressions. There is something so British about him that I am really surprised that he has found such an appeal to American taste. Tommy Cooper, an anarchic comedian in the same way, used to draw a blank space. It is Moore's almost childish vulnerability that is so captivating. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play direct roles against him, but still have excellent one-liners. John Guilgud in particular delivers his with a sarcastic and bitter authority that is a treasure to watch. He invariably steals any scene in which he performs and fully deserves his Oscar. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he never played any other comic role. <br /> <br /> There is an accompanying movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It never reaches the same sublime levels of fun that it reaches, but still pretty good. Guilgud only has an appearance at the beginning and like a ghost. It's darker. And there is some interesting soul-searching. It will disappoint if you watch 'Arthur' first. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to lose interest in Dudley after these two exits. He eventually returned to Britain, discouraged and apparently dying. <br /> <br /> But 'Arthur' is a sample of what could have been. We can only imagine the other great movies he should have done. <br /> <br /> You're sadly lost, Dudley.
