I saw this movie first at the Berlin Film Festival, and I had never seen Hong Kong cinema before. I felt like I was sitting on a roller coaster: the action was so fast, and there was not a dull moment throughout the movie. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks, sings, and fights for himself - one of the many scenes that emphasize the film's extraordinary musical component. This movie is a definite must !!
