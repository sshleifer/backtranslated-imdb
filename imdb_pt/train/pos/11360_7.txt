Chris Gerolmo was careful not to simply give us a list of murdered "Jack-the-stripper" types: he plunged into psychological characterization with convincing results. Maybe mainly due to the excellent performance of Stephen Rea, playing against Donald Sutherland with good empathy for both. Was it the game of these two parts? about everything ?? which made the film something more than just a morbid account of Rostov's butcher's story. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, performed their parts very well. Good direction. The photograph was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary was bound to produce some aberrations, but frankly, given the depth of storytelling and interpretations, we can completely forget this little trivialia. <br /> </ p> <p> <p> For once, an achievement for the HBO TV movie has come to fruition. Recommended, especially if you like to analyze the characterology and forget some of the morbid scenes? which, I shall hasten to add, is never exaggerated.
