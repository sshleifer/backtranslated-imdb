I found this to be a so-so romance / drama that has a good ending and a generally nice feel for it. It's not a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie with normal pre-wedding behavior, but considering it's starring Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a much grittier film, at least in terms of languages. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is the picture of how hard it must be to learn to read and write when you are already an adult. This is the movie's big theme and it involves some moving scenes, but to be honest, the movie is not so memorable. <br /> <br /> It is still a rather light and enjoyable story that I would be happy to recommend.
