I'm not sure if this review contains a real spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so do not read this if you have not seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, and so do everyone I work with - and that's the point. I spent much of my professional life in the movies, without being an actor. Such people are the great heroes of this film: the gaffers, the knobs, the directors in the air, the lighters and writers, the costumes etc etc, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent. Most of the actors are crazy and egocentric to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie does so well, but you must have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is a real-life drama! Possible spoiler alert: In one big scene, the two protagonists, both actors, are discussing how to discuss something personal, something entirely outside the script, with another actor, and they begin to create lines, rehearsing them and criticizing each one's performance . <br /> <br /> Since this movie appeared, what it was, '91, it became fashionable to do this, especially on TV. But hardly anyone did it so well.
