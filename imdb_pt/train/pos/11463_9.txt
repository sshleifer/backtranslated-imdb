I saw this movie at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and I was completely impressed. The structure and execution of the film was fantastic ... I know it will not, but it really deserves an Oscar nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two colleagues were disturbed. Yes, the film is very controversial and I see many people having a lot of problems with it, since it deals with shootings in schools and especially makes you identify with the killers. However, despite its rough and blunt subject, it's worth watching Zero Day. I'm looking forward to going on video so I can buy it - it's very, very good. Very powerful and intense ... the final sequence of filming leaves you speechless because it's almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, the "recordings", the filming and the panic of the students, totally indescribable. I really hope you get the attention you deserve. It's made in the same format as The Blair Witch Project, handheld camera, made to appear like a true home video documentary - but God is INFINITELY better. Very impressive, taking the hat off for everyone involved. If you got the chance, you really should see.
