I'm now in front of the TV, watching Casomai. It is changing, it is evolving or better ... returning. It begins with a marriage between the two protagonists where their love story is told. After that everything changes, a child is born, and everything else usually happens in a couple. It's not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. He does not want to show us anything in particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love story, the story of a couple and, being normal, it becomes different from the rest. It's also a flicker movie, everything is short, every scene is long only a few seconds. It is a story told, many things are known because friends and fathers talk about it, and their opinion is central, opinions create history and destroy it. It's a simple story of a couple like I said, but it's not boring, just show a couple, it must be all that is known, it is, but I'm sure each one of you will want to know what happens, so do not forget to watch the end!
