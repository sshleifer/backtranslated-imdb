I agree with many of the negative comments posted here, for reasons that I will come back later. But this miniseries is powerful and compelling because the talented cast really captures the shadowy truth of Hitler's world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect as Ernst Rohm, the brutal leader of the Brownshirt. Every scene he has with Hitler is explosive! Hitler is so evil that he dominates all but the radical and primitive Rohm - and he clearly digs Rohm just for that reason. The interaction between Stormare and Carlisle illuminates the way Hitler appreciated Rohm's brutality, but later sacrificed him for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone turns into a heartbreaking performance like Geli Raubal, Hitler's condemned niece and victim of her indescribable perversions. Without revealing the sexual dirt directly, Jena Malone faces all the horror of the slow extinction of a young woman's spirit. She uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited in millions in the next few years. And she's brilliant! Zoe Telford almost equals Jena Malone with her interpretation of Eva Braun. Eve is clearly sick, cruel and cruel-but at the same time she almost depended miserably on Adolph's distorted tenderness. The aborted scene of love between them (insinuating the veracity of Hitler's terrible self-loathing) is chilling and erotic. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber performs delightfully like a ferret, like Putzi Hanfstaengel, the cowardly man. -the city that is seduced by Hitler's promises of wealth and power. While a brute like Rohm simply loves the idea of ​​crushing skulls under his boots, Schrieber's character is one of the many Germans who abhor Nazi violence but can not resist the quick and easy path to money and power. His flattery of weak will on Hitler soon loses his wife's respect, played with style and sensuality by the stunning and majestic Julianna Margulies. They provide a true picture of marriage and betrayal. <br /> <br /> These performances lead the mini-series forward, easily surmounting the occasional weaknesses of the script. There is one exception. Regrettably, Matthew Modine's acting skills are simply not good. His noble playful journalist spoils all the scenes he has - the viewer can scarcely wait for Rohm's brown shirts to trample on that convinced, fair look on his face of Hollywood's ignorant and brave golden boy. But the story still works. <br /> <br /> Now, as far as the script's factual inaccuracies are concerned, Hitler's perversions and cruelty are presented in a vibrant and convincing drama. But the record of the Hitler cable battlefield is very distorted. As if they feared that the public could not deal with the idea of ​​evil and courage in the same person, the writers make Hitler look like a weeping coward who "begged" for an Iron Cross. As if someone in the Kaiser's Army could win a medal just whining about it! The film makes it appear that Hitler was a coward in the trenches when he was a fearless soldier. They also suggest that his companions despised him when, in fact, he was widely admired by officers and enlisted men. The depressing thing is that the mini-series succeeds in portraying Hitler as a monster honestly - but they simply could not resist the cheap shot. <br /> <br /> All in all, however, Hitler: Rise of evil is a growing success highlighted by powerful performances.
