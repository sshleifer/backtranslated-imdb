Outside the home there is a different world and the family struggles to tread the line between their father's authority and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The period is captured; The light bakelite swithes, the Georgian floorpan, the framed rails, the wallpaper, the short skirts, the cheeky lads, the mini van, bright modern mangles .... is captured; A wind whipped rocky landscape hewn, local stone walls, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, confidence, faith, deceit, machismo, maturity, loss, sacrifice, horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and fatherhood are all there. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are as relevant today as ever. The fact that some of them are not addressed directly is a testimony in itself to the attitudes of the day, but the fact that they are all here is a testament to the ability to act, of history, and of direction. <br /> <br /> If there is anything bad in this movie, it is that all this deeply ingrained and beautifully staged tension is swept slightly to the end. Maybe I do not understand - the disgrace and sadness felt by many teenagers really disappear if they deal with it (**) - maybe the movie is also trying to send that message - it's worth doing that. <br /> <br /> the movie is trying to say? Children: Parents were young too, parents also fight, everyone makes mistakes, everyone learns, things change, the fight can end happily. Parents: Do not try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well being. <br /> <br /> It sounds simplistic, does not it? Sometimes the movie feels that way too, but then you realize how much is being challenged and discovered. <br /> <br /> The film is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not the problems.
