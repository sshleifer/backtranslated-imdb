First, the release date is 2009, not 2007, for this documentary about long-lasting nature. It should be more appropriately referred to as: "Earth, 2009". Secondly, let me address the complaints of some critics who saw the TV series "Planet Earth" of 2006. <br /> <br /> I did not see this TV series, but I learned here, that this movie is the complete movie. long version of this 2006 TV series. I judge any movie, on its own merits, not by its source. I judge the results on their own, and the results of "Earth, 2009" are indeed excellent. I reject this trivial complaint from some critics: that it is simply an expanded version of the 2006 TV series "Planet Earth". And? It does not really matter. As a movie buff who has watched dozens of documentaries about nature during my life, I was impressed and very impressed with "Earth, 2009". This is the premiere film of Disney's new DisneyNature division and follows in the footsteps of Walt Disney's pioneering and award-winning documentary on nature documentaries of the 1950s and 1960s. Cinematography, film editing , music score, sound and narration are all excellent. There were a few other documentaries about nature that also stood out in these categories. What really defines "Earth, 2009" is its scope. It literally covers the entire planet, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first performance, it was obvious that this documentary required an enormous amount of time and talent to create. <br /> <br /> Three producers were forced to make this incredible documentary. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" convincingly tells the stories of four species in their great migrations, which extends for a year. the stations start in January and end in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. Two high-tech special cameras were used for this film: a camera has a 360-computer-controlled motorized rotation degrees lens and the other is a HD camera with incredible 1000 frames per second. This footage technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes from "Earth, 2009," especially the chase chase and large white sharks jumping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view over the edge of the world's highest waterfall . There are many amazingly beautiful photos in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Via cinematography, soundtrack and narration, there is drama, sadness, humor and much beauty in this documentary. With an excellent soundtrack performed by the world-famous Berliner Philharmoniker, excellent creative and technical photography and narration by James Earl Jones, I consider "Earth, 2009" as the greatest feature film documentary ever made. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication were worth it here. This film should be seen in every school in the world. I foresee an Oscar for Best Documentary, among other awards. Truly, an amazing documentary, amazing, fun and magnificent. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended
