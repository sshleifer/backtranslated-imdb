I found this film a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the eldest announces that he is HIV +, the reactions of family members alone and with each other were touching and yet strange. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a family that is as physically demonstrative as this; nor one so prone to yell at one another. I did not understand why the family thought the younger man could not handle the news, but once beyond that difficulty, I found this movie quite exciting. <br /> <br />
