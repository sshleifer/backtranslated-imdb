I watched this last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most of the other films of the FN era. I loved the way Chip would be all calm in one moment and then VIOLENT the next moment. It was classic. Ah yes. The ladies, the villains, the cigars and the aggressive cops! It has all that. This movie delivered all the goods to me. I particularly loved the way they blended communism into the plot, very common in this age of cinema. Very daring too since the blacklist was popular in those days. I rate this movie as one of the best I've ever seen in the FN genre!
