It is very simple to qualify the film: "A PURE MASTERS". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors, they seem to be citizens of that era, 1100 BC They perfectly customize the characters. A second reason is that the poetry expressed by Homere in his poem is well given by the production. Among others, the narrations made by the choir give a particular atmosphere that makes us part of the artistic representation. Third reason: the reconstruction of the decoration is absolutely perfect, in the regions of the Mediterranean where the action of the poem took place. And above all, the emotion is at the rendezvous point. I repeat my appreciation: "A PURE MASTERS".
