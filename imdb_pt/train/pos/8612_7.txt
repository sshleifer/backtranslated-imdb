I completely disagree with the other comments posted on this film. For example, the movie is based on the book and if the writer had a gay character in it, then as "Hollywood" could put a gay character in the movie. And then there were two gay characters and I thought they reflected very well. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not exaggerated. And Diane Keaton did a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the decency to watch the entire movie, they would have seen that their character developed throughout the film interacting with the other characters. For example, when she and Adam went to look at the car Sara fell into the junkyard, you can see the maternal side of her leaving and later in the movie you saw that she was also invincible. But I think if you're really worried about gay characters and characters that are flawed then this movie is bad. But if you're more open-minded and I do not really know how to have some sense of what's good then you'll like this movie.
