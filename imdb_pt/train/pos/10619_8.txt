Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach from the fame of "The Spy Who Loved Me") and her two assistants Karen (the appellation Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the beautiful Lois Young, who not only first died but also discovers her a nude bath scene for free and profitable) go to Solvang, California, to cover an annual festival in Denmark. Since all the local hotels are crowded, the three lovely ladies are forced to seek accommodation in a remote mansion of Ernest Keller (deliciously played to the nerd perfection by the late Sydney Lassick) and their meek. sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a very unpleasant and lethal family secret residing in his damp basement: a corpulent, pathetic, diapery, swollen, Mongolian man named Junior (an alternate and terrifying portrait of Stephen Furst; Sole in Animal House) capably directed by Danny Steinmann, with uniformly fine acting from a sturdy cast, a convincingly perverse plot, excellent makeup by Craig Reardon, a very scary atmosphere, a wonderfully savage climax, a rhythm slow but steady, friendly, well-designed characters, and a surprisingly surprising final frostbite (the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong pungent punch), it's worth checking out this ill-timed psychopath ignored in the early 1980s.
