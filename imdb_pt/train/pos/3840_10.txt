Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this film. I've seen this movie 6 times and I'm still not tired of it. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all the Dutch films by Paul Verhoeven. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I've seen all of your movies, except the Showgirls. My mother does not like him very much, but I disagree. I think all his movies are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his films, including Total Recall, Wild Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith had never died. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable.
