I saw this on the big screen and it was encapsulated with that. Queen Victoria's youth period is a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young woman was placed in one of the highest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the acting is incredible, the history and attention to detail are out of this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Funny how his mother is played by Elizabeth 1st and William IV is played by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). <br /> <br /> This picture of Victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once - I'm sure she would be at the Jeremey Kyle Show if it had been around: "My mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life" . <br /> <br /> A perfect part of most British and Commonwealth history.
