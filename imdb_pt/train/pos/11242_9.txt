Anyone who is interested in pop music and is not familiar with the trends of British music of the late seventies, make sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once. The film, on the quest for a young girl to make her mark in the music world, captures the times perfectly, from the obvious sexism, difficult economic times, social unrest, the change in pop culture from rough punk to terribly fey pretentious / new futurism romanticism. The styles of music and fashion created daily in Britain in the late seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled (there is really nothing new since 1980). This was a dazzling moment, and Breaking Glass tells a very personal story and examines the cultural landscape, and does both extremely well.
