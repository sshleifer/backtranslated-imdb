Made in 1931, this foreign film must be seen and enjoyed more often. <br /> <br /> We opened in a quiet French village, scanning the rooftops of the citizens who slept. Then we hear something that looks like a party. In investigating the uproar, two neighbors tell the story of two men, supposedly friends, who chose two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our photo star has his number and his friend of his. When he asks his friend, he would divide half the mass, if his ticket was the winning number, his friend readily says no. In fact, the H.E. double hockey sticks do not! That's how he acts on it. <br /> <br /> So when our man discovers that he has the winning ticket and that he was lost, without any fault, he is frantic. Everyone is beside themselves, looking for this ticket, something like a precursor to the "Great Race." Even though it's all a flashback, I've been standing all the time and been so upset about every little thing in this "money-on-the-bench" movie that I use for everyone. Watch Le Million Today!
