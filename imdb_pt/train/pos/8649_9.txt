I bought this a while back, but somehow I forgot to watch it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis, although I am indifferent to Brad Pitt. After that screening, I have to admit that he is a great actor - his character was totally credible, and I did not think of "Brad Pitt." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I can not say the same for David. Duchovny. I'm a fan of X-Files and had to look twice to confirm the date of this movie, as I thought it was done a few years later. I like Duchovny, but I found his character a bit two-dimensional here, except where he's doing voice-overs. This part was strong, it seemed in character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise, I kept thinking "Agent Mulder", which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why did not I notice it before? (I'll be looking up to see what other roles she's made and seeing those as early as possible). I'm a little worried about stereotypes about Lewis, this movie, and "Natural Born Killers" (a firm favorite). Interesting, however, to see a contrast of characters - in NBK she is a willing accomplice, while here she abhors violence and goes to great lengths not to recognize the shadowy side of Early until it is pushed into her face. <br /> <br /> I liked that. movie with almost no reservations. Aside from the fact that Duchovny's character did not seem completely formed (and perhaps be "somewhat faded" by Pitt), it was perfect. I was also pleased with the ending - happy that the innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you may like this movie a lot, and vice versa.
