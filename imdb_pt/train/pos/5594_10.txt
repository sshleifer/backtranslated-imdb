Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> Hedy Lamarr's first glimpse into the world, 19, comes in the early days of the 1930s treasure, when she crosses the canvas in an angelic wedding dress. This would be the beginning of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman who ever appeared on the silver screen. <br /> <br /> It's Eva's (Lamarr's) wedding night and her older husband seems disinterested in his romantic breakthroughs. She retires to the lonely bed and, in a beautiful scene, she plays with her wedding ring when the fulfillment of her marital error overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in cleanliness and order than in love. Gustav Machaty uses beautiful camera angles and an impeccable framing to capture the considerable talent and beauty of Lamarr. Without words spoken at the beginning of the film, she is able to understand our sympathy, our hearts and our support. It was this combination that prepared the audience of the 1930s for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time ... Some thought it was scandalous. <br /> <br /> She returns home to her father's estate and asks for divorce. The next day, she wakes up with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She just has to leave and feel the freedom of the countryside and the fresh air. Eva goes for a horseback ride and it happens on a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in movie history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to appear naked in a big movie. His play in the woods and his lake adventure were legendary scandal. But the audience could not stay away. As with many of today's films, the controversy made it a must-see movie. <br /> <br /> Eve's mischievous adventure presents her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse, who had run off with her clothes. After an awkward meeting, they end up falling in love with each other. His first romantic encounter was almost as controversial as the nude scene, with its flagrant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does a beautiful job in these romantic moments. Machaty creates an enchanting moment when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover, using a beautiful early camera trick. <br /> <br /> It can not be overstated how this performance was brave on Lamarr's part. Many may have assumed it was a professional suicide. Instead, it gained worldwide fame and caught the attention of Louis B Mayer, who has signed a contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments in this movie, even with today's daring standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930s. Again, Machaty was very intelligent with his images, leaving much to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is extremely well done. <br /> <br /> The meeting of Eva's ex-husband and her current lover may be inevitable. However, the consequences of this meeting are not. The film does some unexpected twists in its last act and all this contributes to a great story and a beautiful premiere on the big stage of stardom for Hedy Lamarr. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this time controversial, now meek movie and urge you to look for it in its restored form on DVD. It's easy to be worth it, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is also convincing and the direction is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is an unforgettable treasure. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler movie reviews !!!
