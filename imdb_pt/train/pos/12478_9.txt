What a lovely heart warming television movie. The story tells of a five-year-old girl who lost her father and finds it impossible to deal with it. Your mother is also very distressed ... only a miracle can alleviate her unhappiness. What all the spectators expect will come true. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the mother of the girl, as she was like the nanny in "Jack and Sarah", it is worth watching if you like both Samantha and happy Mathis; year rip ripping movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a lovely grandmother in this delicate and magnificent film. Jodelle Ferland (the little five-year-old) is charming and a very convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story that makes it so touching. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human goodness that is clearly illustrated and clearly still around us in this difficult world we live in. "Mermaid" gives us all hope, realizing that there are many lovely people in the world with much love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
