Half a dozen short stories of varying interest tell us about life in Finland. These stories are intertwined and each contains a scene in which a sonic bang is heard. This indicates that the events described occur at the same time. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a bungee jump that promises some excitement, but the first stories are very discreet. The movie gets better, so stick with it. Two broken marriages in the stories that follow provide much drama, while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief. The last moments with his wife are convincing and exciting. <br /> <br /> While the various scenes of family life take place in Finland, the themes are of a general nature wherever you live. <br /> Collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good 90-minute drama.
