This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. It is really refreshing to watch and I was in points many times. I think there is a social awareness factor for this as well, which makes it quite interesting. if these were white girls, would they have the same reaction? maybe they would, maybe they would not? the characters know no bounds (check out my lyrics) and do not exclude anyone from their distorted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. my favorites is the bob the builder. It's so silly that it's cool. If you like twisted black comedy then this is for you. if you like to keep up appearances it probably is not.3 A non blonde's is another hilarious British comedy from the BBC shown on TV! It's such a funny show and the characters unleashed on the unsuspecting audience are laughing out loud funny! It would be impossible to keep a straight face by watching the crazy characters and the reactions of the public! This series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced!
