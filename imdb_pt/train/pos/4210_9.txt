I really enjoyed this movie. All aspects of the film were top notch, including the most important, to me anyway, the script and the acting. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is totally convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum might have dealt with this role. This is my first exposure to the work of Jean Peter that I remember. She impressed a lot here that I will definitely be looking for her other job. Thelma Ritter, in a role without glamor, deserved the Oscar nomination that received for interpreting the informant. This movie works on all levels. Black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story holds the viewer from the start. Widmark and Peters have great chemistry in their difficult novel. Highly recommended, 9/10.
