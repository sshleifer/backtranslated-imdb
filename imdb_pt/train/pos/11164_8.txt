A century ago in Brooklyn, the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and his volunteer brigade firefighters lead to Brodie's famous bet that he can jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be familiar to many people through a parody of Bugs Bunny, "Bowery Bugs" from 1949. This generally very nice movie would probably be more widely available were it not for the notorious scene and haunting surrounding some Chinese tenement dwellers - a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes, giving the film a great historical interest in my opinion.
