This program is a lot of fun and the title song is so captivating that I can not get it out of my head. I find that as I get older I feel drawn to the wrinkles that make things, and these four are excellent in their endeavors. Some of what they do is outrageous, but brilliant, considering that now, with our PC world, we would never be able to do that in real life. I always learn something from the shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy and a bit of forensic work, you'll love this show. That reminds me of Quincy, I one way and Barney Miller the other the way they work and interact with each other. They mess up a lot, but they do the job, and that's what counts.
