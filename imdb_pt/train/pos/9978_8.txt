I have to say, I loved Vanishing Point. I saw the original, and this is a great remake of it. Even though I have not followed the original plot (that's why I gave 8 out of 10), it was still very good and this is probably a better plot. <br /> <br /> As for the car, well, the DJ comment in the end on the Challenger going to the bulldozers is unlikely (And if you look, the speedometer needle was swinging between 145 and 150), but even so I did not see one in the engine in one of the opening scenes where they show the engine, the original plot had a supercharged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say that aerodynamics would not allow this, the Chrysler 300C normally aspirated today can reach 190 km / h, and if you look at that thing, following a road with it is like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph. Also, in a wind tunnel test, if you put an air dam on the Challenger, it would probably be more aerodynamic.
