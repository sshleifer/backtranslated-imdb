I LAUGHED A LOT!!! delirious was so funny .. I was in tears. Eddie Murphys prints are absolutely perfect. The best impression was from James Brown and Mr. T> SO FUNNY !! It's strange how Eddie Murphy was at that time and how it is now DELIRIOUS is a must see, but if you do not like foul language not watch but amazing and so funny .. I've seen it 6/7 times and still make me pee every time .. This is Eddie Murphy in his prime and you can see where he got the humor and the movie ideas as crazy professor of. He makes impressions of his family too, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> If I were there ...
