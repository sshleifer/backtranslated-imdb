A great story, based on a true story about a young black man and all the hardships along the road. Being that this is the first Denzel Washington movie that he himself would direct, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical, but who would not ...? But again, he's a great actor with many years of experience, and the end result was great. The story is told in an excellent way, causing you to have difficulties during childhood and young adulthood, see yourself in these situations. So you hit hard, letting you know that you're not the only one going through hell. In short, a touching story about a young man trying to survive in this fucking world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this film). 8/10
