If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we would all remember that. But I was only four when I left. If you have not seen it yet, hire Dr. Dolittle, Showtime, I Spy, Pluto Nash and all the comedy movies from Eddie's family - so watch this. Hands down, you'll laugh 90% of the time. The other 10% will be wiping the tears from their eyes. <br /> <br /> It really needs to be noticed more than once to understand all the jokes. From coarse humor to a joke to kids! (If you have seen, you will laugh here) - you will love his things. If you can, (or are you a big fan) try to download clips of Eddie's acts. All the shows are different as you imagine and he has even funnier jokes. <br /> <br /> But that's like the "best of" Eddie Murphy's "X-rated" if you want. <BR> And all I can say is that I do not watch Delirious if you do not like comedy, have no sense of humor or are not fun to hang out with. You're just going to drop this great Eddie Murphy classic and possibly make someone miss it. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie got the cop out of Beverly Hills and got famous because of him - he's delirious.
