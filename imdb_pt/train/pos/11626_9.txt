This is an excellent thriller by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street), which for 85 minutes sets aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying - the evil of humans. We are far more likely to find Jackson Rippner's benign malice than Freddy Kruger, and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) does an excellent job of presenting a sociable, friendly, and even charismatic killer. The performances of Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire, of The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level between two people, their eyes, their faces. It is a small-scale action, not the wide sweep of the screen, and is no less convincing for these limitations. Cinematography is nothing special, although, of course, you can only do so much with a camera on the edge of a passenger jet, but the dialogue is excellent, the story tense. There are no distractions, no subplot confuses the issue that is at the center of a battle between the main characters. Keeping his focus and avoiding distractions, Wes Craven is able to catch what is a minimal plot and turn it into an exciting and fast action thriller.
