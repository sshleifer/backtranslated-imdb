I always enjoyed watching it when it hit primetime television every year in the 1960s. It's a typical epic of Hollywood history, dramatized, stylized and full of inaccuracies, but it's a fun movie and a beautiful movie. Cecil B. DeMille at the end of his life is the executive producer of this remake of his 1938 film. His son-in-law, actor Anthony Quinn, who played the supporting role of Beluche in the 38-year-old film, is the director of his directorial debut and swan song, because he never directed a film before and never would do it again. DeMille reunited a team that had recently worked on his 10 Commandments to help Quinn achieve it, including former DeMille associate producer / actor Henry Wilcoxon overseeing the project. Also from the 10 Commandments are screenwriter Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, director of 2nd unit Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, directors Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, the stylists Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Lester who as a costume team received the only Oscar nomination from The Buccaneer. A great cast here of team DeMille led by Yul Brynner as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston as future general president Andrew Jackson. Also in the cast are Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. In just over two hours, he drags himself on a few spots, but pays off with excellent battle scenes. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.
