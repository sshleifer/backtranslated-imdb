I remember hitchhiking to Spain at the age of 25, hitchhiking, which turned out to be two small fugitive Italian traffickers. They were doing a lot of outlaw, but on the other side carrying a small picture of Jesus in his pocket for his protection ... Fair and unfair, good and bad, criminal and correct where here in a new combination, out of the categories I used to know. 'Les Valseuses' gives me, despite being a movie and not of real life, a close picture of my own experiences: the intensity of each moment as you leave 'all behind' and goes to the moment, whatever appears, is another state of mind and also a "dangerous" way of life because, as we all know, there are people who are not prepared for it and willing to pursue it by "stealing" and so on ... This movie plays "values" is a story about "what is right and wrong": moral. It is the resurrection of the individual fighting against himself free against 'false morality' and conformity ... There is danger all the time, because, so far as you can go with your own 'freedom' and cross your own moral and other borders people? What do you do with people who are willing to hurt you, put you in jail, or even shoot you for the things you do, like stealing gas from a multinational oil company for your fifth hand car? Les Valseuses arouses these questions in me, because morality, in contradiction with the usual "media message", is quite complex ...
