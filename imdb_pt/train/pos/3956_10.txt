HUSBAND BEWARE is a remake of the classic Shemp BRIDELESS GROOM. The new culinary scene of the movie at the beginning of the movie is great. Stooges are always funny when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of filming, we cut the original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I've noticed about these remakes from 1953 to 1956 is that they fit the new story. They do an insert shot if the old storyline does not match. <br /> <br /> HUSBAND BEWARE has a new ending, but I will not give it to those who want to be surprised. <Br /> <br /> **** of 4 stars.
