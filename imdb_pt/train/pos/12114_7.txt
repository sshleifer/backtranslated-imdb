This film is obviously low budget and filmed in British Columbia, Canada. The obstacles that needed to be overcome to make this film convincing (defined in California and the 60s and 80s) were well designed.

Dave Toschi) and George Dzundza (Zodiac - at the time it was believed that Arthur Leigh Allen, already authorized by DNA and fingerprints) played a game of cat and mouse reviewing the crime. scenes together, each trying to unleash the other on an emotional revelation. Omos dying from some sort of terminal illness and knowing that Dzundza did so, still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family and becoming an alcoholic along the way. unconscious and self-absorbed (like all serial killers) to the carnage left in its wake. The only disappointment was the "over the top" ending otherwise quite accurate. If you get bored of the typical Hollywood fluff or have an interest in the case of the zodiac, check it out.
