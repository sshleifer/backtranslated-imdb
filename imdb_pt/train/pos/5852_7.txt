This was the first PPV in a new era for WWE, as Hulk Hogan, The Warrior Supreme, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel were gone. A new crop of talent needed to be pushed. And it all started with Lex Luger, a former NWA heavyweight world champion getting a title shot against Yokozuna. Lex traveled across the US on a bus called Lex Express to inspire Americans to join him in their attempt to defeat the Japanese monster (which was actually Samoan) and put the WWE Championship back in American hands. As such, there was a lot of expectation for this game. <br /> <br /> But every good PPV needs an undercard and that had some good things to do. <br /> <br /> The night began with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase. in a good game. The story that went into this was that DiBiase had chosen Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his loss of shock with the 1-2-3 Kid on RAW in July. Ramon, furious, joined the team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster, 1-2-3 Kid Against the Money. To match their differences, both received one against one, DiBiase vs. Ramon and Shyster vs. The Kid. Razor was able to resolve his side of the deal after hitting a Razor's Edge. <br /> <br /> Next came the Steiner Brothers putting the WWE Tag Team titles on the line against The Heavenly Bodies. Depsite the interference of "The Bodies" manager Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner's throat with a tennis racket, they were able to pull off the win in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect had been fighting since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels faced Perfect after his loss to Lex Luger. Perfect, then, cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he distracted him in a title fight against Marty Janetty. Michaels had won the title back and was putting him on the line against Mr. Perfect, but Michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7-foot Diesel bodyguard. Micheals and Perfect had an excellent start here, but it was Diesel who proved the difference by pulling Perfect out of the ring and throwing him on the steel steps for Shawn to win by the count. <br /> <br /> Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner early in the evening, easily counting the 1-2-3 Kid. <br /> <br /> Next came one of the great matches of the night as Bret Hart prepared to fight Jerry. Lawler for the title of undisputed king of WWE. But Lawler left with crutches, saying that he had been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he had arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had an acceptable match that Hart won with a sniper. He was then attacked from behind by Lawler. This prompted WWE president Jack Tunney to the ring, who told Lawler he would receive a lifelong suspension if he did not fight Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with the shooter, but Hart refused to let go and the referee reversed his decision. So after all that Lawler was named the undisputed king of WWE. This meeting was followed by Ludvig Borda who destroyed Marty Janetty in a short match. Undertaker ended his long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, which had begun in 1992 when the Undertaker defeated Wippleman Kamala's client in Summerslam and continued when Wippleman's last monster, Giant Gonzales, destroyed Taker in the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive win over Gonzales here. Gonzales then called Wippleman, chokeslamming him after a bad match. <br /> <br /> Then it was time for six action man tags like Smoking Gunns (Bart and BIly) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka arresting Samu. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, putting the WWE title on the line against Lex Luger and it was all aboard the Lex Express. Lex stormed out, but Yokozuna took over. Lex went back as he was able to avoid a banzai fall and then body beat Yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji while Yokozuna was counted. Luger won a good game !!!!! Balloons fell from the ceiling. All the heroes came out to congratulate him on his victory. Yokozuna may have held the title, but Luger proved he could be defeated. The only question was, who could beat him in the ring and take that title away from him?
