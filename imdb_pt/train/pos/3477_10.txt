some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined .. I totally disagree. the quality shows did not rise or down and uncomfortable, earn my opinion, like a very good chrecter.i looked at a poll at jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said that the second series of scrappys was the fall of Scoobys.OK, so many said yes, but 28% still can not be wrong.I like the way most episodes focused on comedy.I believe the show would have been rubbish if it was the same 5 person / dog solving mystery in the same formula. The cap was a breath of fresh air for the show. Some people turned it off, but when it was introduced scrappy displaying DOUBLED figures back to the show. All the episodes and segments were very funny .i was intrigued by yabba shorts and .but at the end of the day it's a matter of opinion, whether you like scrappy or it's not a matter of opinion, certainly there is no env fact But in my OPINION this was a superb series that gave a start to show off a new formula and lease of life. Nuff said.
