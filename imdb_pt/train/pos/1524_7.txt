This movie is a classic should be. It's not perfect, certainly. The rhythm, while perfect for the stage, is in the form of slow film like a tortoise with arthritic knees. Jean Seberg is misguided to be too sweet and too gentle. She demonstrates plenty of talent, ability and ability to convincingly play the intelligent, passionate and confident Joan, but unfortunately the director has lost the character's point of view. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. Nowhere else has his dialogue been sharpened, nor the most musical lines. However, processing this movie requires you to analyze it as a lawyer. This movie is a case, and the viewer is the judge. This is how this photo is to be enjoyed. 7/10
