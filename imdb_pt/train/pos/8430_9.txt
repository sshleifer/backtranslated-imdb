It is always good to see Angela Bassett playing a role in which she can actually sink her teeth. She is sometimes intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "colored" woman forced to make a home in a desolate mud bank on the outskirts of Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at a not-quite-nice role as his partner, Boesman. Willie Jonah performs as delicate as the stranger who discovers the new seating area of ​​Boesman and Lena. It is not often that you have the chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes. Although based on one play, the late director John Berry (who also directed Claudine) opens the material by filming the movie in the widescreen cinemascope format. It also keeps things visually interesting through the creative blocking of actors and showing us things mentioned in the play. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have nominated Angela Bassett for an Oscar nomination. This is definitely a movie that is worth looking for.
