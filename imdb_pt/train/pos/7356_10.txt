If you have not seen Eva Longoria on Desperate House Wives, then you're missing out. Eva will be one of the biggest Latin stars and you will see her in theaters soon. This was Eve's first movie and she does a great job. She was 24 when she shot, and it looked hot then. As for this low budget film, it is very good for the director for the first time, who has another soon to be released film "Juarez, Mexico" currently playing at many film festivals across the United States. In fact, it looks like it may have a limited release of some news. What would be good to see is a "Snitch'2" with a bigger budget.
