This is one of the best episodes of the second season of MOH, I think Mick Garris has a problem with women ... He kills them all, they are often the victims (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs, Do not I remember the episode of Argento in season 1, etc., obviously Imprint). I think he likes to see women being burned, tortured, mutilated and I do not know. No less "Right to Die" is one of the best, with good curves and graphic scenes and suspense (especially with the pictures of the cell scene, wonderful). The acting is like the whole series, regular I could be worse like "Pro-life" or "We scream for ice cream". I also think the plot could be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible, killing and ending with women, mutilating animals and so on ... the first season was better than the second with episodes like "Cigarrette burns", "Homecoming" funny), "Imprint" (really shocking).
