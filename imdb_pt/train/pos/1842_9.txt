Series 2 had a great start! I do not think you need to have watched series 1 to get an idea of ​​what's going on, but like any series, it's good to feel some sense of the characters and care what happens to them. And this show makes you think so! These 30-something women seem to lead a fascinating and exciting life, but the premise is believable and realistic. So the twists and turns that come with love and sex are exciting to watch, but you also know that these problems also happen to real women. It's about the decisions we make as women and how we are sometimes taken in certain ways in our lives, rather than consciously making those choices!
