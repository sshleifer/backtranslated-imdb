This is an absolutely charming film, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's extremely funny and the cast is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is primarily associated with his Shakespearean work, he shows in this film that he is not restricted to playing only classical theater. He manages the transition from the cynical divorce lawyer, who tries to avoid women and their traitors, to the passionate puppy who falls in love with Lady X, played by Merle Oberon effortlessly. The dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere charming. Ralph Richardson was a delight to watch as well. I recommend.
