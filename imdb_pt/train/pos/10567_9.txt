Wonderful. One of the best musicals of all time. The three Busby Berkely numbers closing the film are spectacular, but what makes this movie so wonderful is the incredible uninterrupted rhythm and natural acting of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also adorable, even though she has not been a great actress). There's a coolness in the movie that you do not see in the movies today, let alone the generally flamboyant 1930s movies, even though the plot, involving the making of movie prologues, is pretty old-fashioned.
