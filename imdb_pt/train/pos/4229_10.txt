Do not waste time reading my review. Get out and see this amazingly good episode, which may well be the best Columbus ever written! Ruth Gordon is perfectly chosen as the intriguing and charming mystery writer who kills her son-in-law to avenge her daughter's murder. Columbo is his usual crumpled, stunned, and much smarter than he looks, and this particular part features a fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, this was not written by creators advertised Levinson or Link, but is possibly the densest, most completely original and entangled columbo plot ever. Totally satisfying in almost every department and overflowing with witty and witty dialogues and thoughts. The truly unexpected and inventive climax is the best of them all. 10/10 ... look for this on Netflix!
