This movie is exactly what the title describes - an attempt to get you to buy what the writers have to offer. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's kind of fun to watch the Toronto style of 1996 that I remember with all your silly haircuts, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It really did not change anything; just a nice, safe, cheap and provincial little backwater that makes a great meeting place for international movie types! It's also fun to watch Kenny and Spenny go to LA and find out that it's Toronto again, with just a bizarre assortment of beach bums, musicians, fortune tellers, and even more arrogant movie types. <br /> <br /> I do not see Pitch as a movie to be enjoyed; it is not entertainment unless the viewer likes to see the aspirations of someone being trampled underfoot. I consider Pitch as an alert that power and money are really kept by studio executives and production houses. Potential (and "successful") writers, musicians, and actors are still mere transients even when they hit Big Time. <br /> <br /> So, Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell you a warning. Buy it or not, but the message is still there.
