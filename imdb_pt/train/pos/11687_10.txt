My affection for Chris Rock varies with his films, I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but I hated everyone in that movie after him. I like him when he is himself and does not hold himself, as in Dogma. Well, this is your best yet, I was not expecting it to be that good. You fucked my ass all the time. Chris Rock offers a wonderful story, backed by some of the funniest comedies I've seen in a while. Loved it.
