I could not be more excited; Just eight years in 1983, I was going to see a Star Wars movie in the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. At that time, my only Star Wars experience had been some Star Wars exhibits on HBO. I still had not seen The Empire Strikes Back. <br /> <br /> And the boy, made that day to my less critical eyes. Jabba. Great rebel spacecraft. The Emporer. A green light saber Wow! Since that magical day, I must have watched this movie hundreds of times. I can not even form an accurate estimate at this time. With these multiple views, I obviously noticed that this movie - REAL Episode III - has its flaws. <br /> <br /> Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie, these "failures" are more like "Lies". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magic day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had mine. And this was my movie Star Wars.
