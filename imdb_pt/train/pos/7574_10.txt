This is one of the best in the series, ranking up there with Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape) The game has a very good plot in which you play as Claire Redfield in the search of your brother, Chris Redfield probably knows of the original Resident Evil) It's as scary as the other Resident Evil, and contains many more scenes. <br /> <br /> My Rating: **** out of ***** Stars (Rating based on the comparison with other video games)
