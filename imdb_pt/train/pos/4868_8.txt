I gave this movie 8 out of 10, reserving 10 for eg Amadeus and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire more recently. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge in such a film without understanding the life, mentality and soul of Balkan that Kusturica presents masterfully. To understand, you really need to be one of the Balkans. This is an incredible movie, much better and more contemporary of his previous films, which are boring at the moment, I think Kusturica is advancing with this film. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art in itself, every scene is artistic to the limit. The plot is probably a fairy tale, do not remember now, but remember to read to my daughter who will sleep a similar story.
