Despite a tight narrative, Johnnie To's Election sometimes looks like it's a longer picture, with many characters and plots abandoned or ultimately unresolved. Some of them are treated in a truly excellent and much superior sequel, Election 2: Harmony is a Virtue, but it's still a captivating and reliable thriller about a contested Triad election that ignores the usual shootings and blasts (though not violence) in favor of ever changing alliances that can turn into the time it takes to make a phone call. It is also a film in which the most ruthless character is not always the most threatening, as the final chilling makes clear: it is possible to imagine a lifetime of psychological counseling being necessary for all the trauma one inflicts on an unhappy viewer. Simon Yam, often a variable actor, but always at his best under To's direction, has probably never been better at leading, not least because Tony Leung's far more extroverted performance makes his stillness more powerful.
