If the redundancy of getting out of the boat, on the boat, off the bus, on the bus .. is a way to waste time, then you should go back to the Hollywood movies that involve this part in an assembly in order to reach the shots Of money. and, in doing so, leaves him without connection and in the cinematographic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life. Long travel sequences really allow the viewer to have the same frustration and the 'wait in line' feeling the characters must endure. Frustrating, yes. Vital? Indeed. the limbo of this journey is the key to the "lack of roots" of this Turkish family. Beautiful movie with great acting. Sad, but worth it.
