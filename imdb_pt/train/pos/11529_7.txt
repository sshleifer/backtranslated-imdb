As a biopic, "The Red Haired Lady" (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco has transformed the notorious divorced society Leslie Carter into an international star) is certainly not in a league with Warner's other biopic. similar vintage, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what the heck?), but "Lady" is a nice film in itself - and shares some characteristics in common with the classic Cagney. Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "The Red Haired Lady" overflows with the old taste of show business. (Among other things, both films feature delightful theatrical lodging sequences, as well as the inevitable scenes behind the scenes and in the offices of the theater managers.) In addition, in "Lady," as in Cohan's biopic, support is made up of family and beloved characters actors of the period, all doing the kind of high-level work that we remember. <br /> <br /> I need to add that once again as "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Red Haired Lady" does not let the truth get in the way of telling a good story? But also as "Dandy", "Lady" can - gloriously! - convey the essence of personality greater than your show business giant life. Everybody knows that Cagney worked with Cohan all the time on his brilliant and affectionate rendition of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" - but few viewers realize that Claude Rains did a similar service to David Belasco in "The Red Haired Lady" - and made with a style that almost equals that of Cagney. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco perfectly captures the galvanic personality of this legendary showman in all of his dazzling glory. Rains gives a tremendously enjoyable, superbly-watched and remarkably realistic performance as the man all Broadway singers called "The Wizard." Watching Claude Rains in action (looking at each scene as if he was having a blast!) In "The Red Haired Lady" is seeing David Belasco take a leap in the movie as if he could barely wait to shake things up. in the main trunk once again. <br /> <br />
