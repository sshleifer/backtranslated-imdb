This is an interesting true story of Archie Gray Owl, who dreamed of being an Indiain when he was a child until he was 17 years old. He was born in England, then moved to Canada where he was adopted by Indiains and he writes collums in magazines and he wrote a book that caught the attention of millions that the book was from his life. But in the end he told his wife that he was not a real Indian and she was okay with it and he died at the age of 43, two years after returning to savagery.
