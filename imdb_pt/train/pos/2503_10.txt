I'm extremely picky about the movies I see. I had heard about Moon Child completely by accident. I have been a fan of L'Arc En Ciel for some time and I have been a fan of Gackt and Mizer just recently. <br /> <br /> I finally discovered that the movie was being re-released and I caught it without a second thought. Being as critical of me as I am about movies, I admit, the action scenes can be somewhat obnoxious at times ... but they must also be, as another user suggested, it's the quintessential quintessence before storm, quoting Gary Oldman of Leon ... without getting into the spoilers, the movie struck me with great force, because you realize that the limits of friendship are limitless and as they say, true friendship is loyalty and marriage, it is until death that you leave. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt give performances that show why they are able to delve into their lyrics, their passion for music happens on the big screen and in the process creates an exemplary movie that will reach the soul and evoke the emotional reaction. <br /> <br /> Upon seeing the movie for the first time, I realized that it will probably stay in high gear with regard to my collection. I want to encourage anyone to read this post to get the movie if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend in the movies ... this takes a whole new direction using classic Yakuza movie elements and how you can go wrong with one Ryo Ishibashi's cameo of Audition's fame and Takashi Miike's "Suicide Club"? <br /> <br /> Dude ... I just can not say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
