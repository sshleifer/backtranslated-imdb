Okay, that was a great episode. Much better than the credit you get. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera is splendid. Even better. I love that final shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great and the cast of guests (minus the defenseless victims) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I do not like in this episode is that many things are left unexplained. Why does sex change? what's the purpose? And they are aliens? what type? Why have they never been shown in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I'm giving this episode a HIGH THREE star. One of my favorites yet, but the plot holes bother me. Still ... I will not let it ruin my entertainment.
