"The Woman in Black" is easily one of the most scary British ghost stories of all time. A young lawyer, after arriving in a small town to take care of the property of a dead client, is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in black. with an extremely sinister atmosphere and the jitters are calculated and provide the maximum possible effect. The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the ending is quite disturbing. The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times. So if you want to see a truly scary horror movie give this one a look. I dare anyone to watch "The Woman in Black" alone at night with the lights off. Best recommended. 10 out of 10.
