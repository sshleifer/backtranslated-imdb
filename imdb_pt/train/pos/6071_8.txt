I contend that no matter how much I look for, I will never find a better cinematic rendition of "Othello". If you love Kenneth Branagh's masterpieces "Much Ado About Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) as much as I do, I'm sure you'll also find "Othello" by Oliver Parker irresistible. Laurence Fishburne has been in several splendid roles during his career. He was quite fantastic in "Boys n the hood" (1991) - I always considered his fun role of Furious Styles as his greatest achievement. That was, of course, long before I saw it. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his entire career, but he does a brilliant and fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh is simply phenomenal in the most fascinating role of the story, manipulates the villain Iago. Marvelous "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare's ingenious works. He deals with his favorite topics: dishonesty, envy, falsehood and jealousy. This film adaptation is certainly one of the best movies I have ever seen, based on the plays of William Shakespeare.
