Currently on the new METOO schedule at 4 pm on weekdays, shortly after "Maverick" and just before "Wild, Wild West" (followed by "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I do not know if I actually saw an episode of it when it was originally, but I'm really captivated by it. Surreal, unusual and surreal stories, set in a mythical West. Sort of the "Naked City" of Westerners. <br /> <br /> And the invited stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (as treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. as a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("War of the Worlds"), Gloria Talbott ("I married a monster from outer space") <br /> <br /> Ran for EIGHT SEASONS , more than 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as the head of track Gil Favor, the most impassive man who is ever lived, with the code of honor of a samurai, and just the right balance between tenacity and opening hands. I would vote for him for president any day. (PS He had a very interesting bio: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And the young Clint Eastwood is quite impressive as his impulsive right hand, "Rowdy" Yates . In addition, veteran western actor and country music figure (the immortal "One-eyed, One Horn, Flying Purple People Eater") Sheb Wooley is there as the experienced beater Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the grumpiest character of a cook you could ask for as "Wishbone." <br /> <br /> And then there's that great theme song played by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between this and the theme "Maverick," I have Western themed tunes going through my head all day long.) <br /> <br /> I look forward to every episode; I'm collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a moo-ving experience) is always guaranteed, as if expecting to see if the boys would have their difficulties straightened out before the commercial. <br /> <br /> "Rollin ', rollin', rolling ..."
