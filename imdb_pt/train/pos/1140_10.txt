I've been a fan of this movie for years and years. Because of Teri Hatchers' entry into the vanguard, I had to take the film off the shelf and watch it. Why did not people in 1991 see how wonderful this movie was beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. Although I have never watched daytime soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch. The acting is incomparable to a comedy and writing is so clever. I recommend you watch this if you have not already watched. You'll see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... all give splendid performances.
