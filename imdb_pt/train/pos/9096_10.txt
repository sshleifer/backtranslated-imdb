Lovely! I saw Domestic Import in Philly in October with my kids. We all enjoyed it so much that we saw a second time with my parents. I have not heard them laughing like this in years! It was the first time I remember seeing a movie that my parents and children could enjoy. It's very cute and we can not wait to get out on DVD. They need to make more movies like Domestic Import. It's refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not be ashamed). I have not seen such a cute movie since My Greek Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as her mother. She was also in Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also in this and is hilarious. I remember him from WKRP.
