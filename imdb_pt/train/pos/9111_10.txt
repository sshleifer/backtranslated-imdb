"Captains of April" is very good. The story is not a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But that gives us an idea of ​​how it was. The fiction of the story is not of great interest, but it does not spoil the film. The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia are not exaggerations and the film is also a tribute to his deeds. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the Revolution of April 25. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully. Lisbon is as beautiful as ever. Do not miss it! I really liked this movie.
