I did not know anything about the movie before watching and I think it was the "unplanned" factor that helped me endure at first and then as more than I expected. <br /> <br /> The scenery was interesting, strange but interesting. The plot had gaps / heels that I think throws the audience out a bit. There is not a great soundtrack playing in the background, creating the "romantic" environment. But they all did not matter. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. There was some strange chemistry inexplicable that I could not resist; I fell in love with it and here I am, writing this comment. The subtle love portrait of the two actors was superb, and I believe that this is the core of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit down a bit and then slowly began to understand the little things that I did not realize at first. I can not guarantee that everyone will like it, but I hope you enjoy it.
