Yesterday, I went alone to the movies, because here in Mexico, most of the time, movies from other countries are part of the so-called "alternative camara" (alternative camera). But once I saw this film, I realized that not all foreign films are alternatives. Fortunately, this is a good example. But I have to say that I enjoyed this film so much .. that in the end I was happy .. this movie is a small spoonful of hope these days. And the main lesson for me ... is that at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. This is a good option to see a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention the good music .. especially the main song of the movie .. Quotes that make life worthwhile .... Excellent song! !!
