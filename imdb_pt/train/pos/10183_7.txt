This is probably Karisma at its best, besides Zubeidaa. Nana Patekar also gives her her best, without even trying. The story is very good at times, but in the end it seems to drag on, especially when Shahrukh appears in the photo. What really made me like it were the performances of the leads, the delivery of dialogues, as well as the story, for what it was. It could have been better targeted and edited. The support case was great, including Karima's mother-in-law, even though she had a brilliant moment, it was great to watch her. <br /> <br /> The sets were also very good. I really did not like the portrait of a Canadian family, but once they step on in India, it's as real as possible. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'd give a joke!
