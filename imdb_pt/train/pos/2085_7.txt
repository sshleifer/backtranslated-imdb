"The Good Earth," by Sidney Franklin, achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and excellent acting, especially by Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for his O-Lan performance. The Rainers' performance is so complete that it is almost unrecognizable. With very little dialogue throughout the film (and is long), Rainer uses facial and body language. She looks and acts Chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily confuse her as such. <br /> <br /> The film remains relevant today because it explores the rags of the history of wealth and the universal themes that come with it. . When Lung and his wife O-Lan finally achieve financial success after years of hunger and poverty, they find a life full of possessions, but without meaning. It is only when they return to earth after fighting a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to watch) that they again find satisfaction. A common formula relying on the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially for 1937) makes the film a classic. Money is worth nothing without friends and family, one point that the film takes home perfectly in the last 10 minutes with an emotionally satisfying conclusion.
