The best part of An American In Paris is the long ballet sequence at the end, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living embodiment of several great painters. Kelly has already established herself as a flooring artist in Paris, so the sequel is the logical end to a musical full of life and energy, songs by Gershwin and cast members such as Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was at her best here - it's a bit different from Singin 'in the Rain, and the effect of the whole movie as a cover with ballet gives a definite wow factor. No wonder the sequel is over 'That's Entertainment' after all the other MGM musical highlights have passed!
