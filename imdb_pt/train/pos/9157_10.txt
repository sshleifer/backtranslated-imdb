Jane Eyre has always been my favorite romance! When I came across this version of the movie in the late 90's, I was in a trance! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a bit long to sit in a session, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was glad they cast a normal actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and the location. For those who are fans of Jane Eyre, this is the version to watch !!! For those who are interested, I just found this DVD version. I watched my copy on VHS almost to break, so I was very happy to find it on DVD.
