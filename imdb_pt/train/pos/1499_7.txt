For fans of the Hammer-type horror movies of the 1970s, this movie should be a treat. The only thing I did not like about the movie was that Peter Cushing was wasted in the worst episode. In general, however, this is a small solid and scary movie. If this is not the best Amicus film, it is certainly one of them. The best episode, save last, is Jon Pertwee as a horror movie actor - he's really excellent. As much as Pertwee has that role, it's hard to believe he did not make those kinds of movies any more. In short, this is a fun movie, which scared me like a kid, and that still gives me shivers until today.
