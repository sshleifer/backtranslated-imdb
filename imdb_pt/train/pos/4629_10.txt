My father was the prison director (he's retired now) featured in this documentary and I grew up around life in prison so maybe my opinion is totally different from everyone watching this movie. I'll say that, the filmmakers who brought us this miracle of 93 minutes are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to: A) Show and tell this story, B) Enter into these inmates, minds and hearts, and C) Do all this responsibly. Responsible for his art and, more importantly, responsible to the inmates and staff of the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They should be praised endlessly for this work. Taking 170 hours, yes HOURS, filming and power cut and reduce up to 93 fascinating minutes is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respect. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie under circumstances that only very, very few were able to see it. I was in the tracing of inmates. I was in the same room with these men as they watched their hearts being poured on the screen. I saw men crying on the television crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you, it was a very deep experience. These men committed horrendous crimes in some cases, but found ways to try to redeem themselves, even if they considered themselves irretrievable. How many of us have the courage to do this? How many people could do what they did in such a tough environment? Watching them react to the film was an experience for which I am eternally grateful, and I will never forget that. I thank the men who allowed me to glimpse their lives, thank my father for making this possible and thank Philomath Films for devoting their blood, sweat, soul and tears to this project. <br /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about life in prison, and the inmates are inside it. 'Oz' is not real, television is not real. 'Shakespeare Behind Bars' is.
