This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is moving and convincing on the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm caved on him. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them that he will try out a baseball team if he does. They win (partly because of all batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch more than 90 miles per hour), and he keeps his part in the deal - and he's autographed! <br /> <br /> If you have already decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult, the story of Jim Morris will contact you. It is moving and inspiring, and man's relationships sound true. <br /> <br /> However, inspiration is not the only reason why I rent this. Dennis Quaid is just downright purdy in the party, and a baseball movie with a handsome man changing a diaper is my idea of ​​heaven. Ladies, if you feel the way I do, check this out.
