I love this movie because it showed that they were not killing for fun, but to save those they loved! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job portraying Ned and Joe. There are some bad scenes, but it's all right. The language is very soft and sometimes does not even know it's there. This movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean they are vicious killers! I hope people watch this movie and learn about important moments in history like this. There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for the armor of a book that Ned looked at! This is also how people remember them, their armor. I hope people watch this movie and get interested in me.
