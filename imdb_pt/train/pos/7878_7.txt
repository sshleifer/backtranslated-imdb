As my family history tells me, my father, Milton Raskin, played piano for the band Dorsey. After Sinatra joined the band, my father practiced with him for hours on end. Then, in a moment, my father told Sinatra that he was really good at being stuck with such a small group (band), and that he should venture on his own. At that time, Sinatra already had enough credits to do just that! Dorsey never forgave my father, and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have some photos and records for that purpose, as does Berkley University in California. <br /> I've seen almost every Sinatra movie more often than I'd like to say, and their movies never grow old. . . Thank you Frank.
