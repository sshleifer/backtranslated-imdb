This complicated western was a landmark in JAMES STEWART's career following his return from war service, wanting to change his image by making a western, which is widely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the 1950s, as it is very impressive. Too bad it was not photographed in Technicolor. Stewart wins first prize for "the weapon that beat the West," but then has to spend the rest of the movie trying to get it back when stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is an obscure girl with an unpleasant reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the local bad boy gunslinger in Dodge City. WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend. And you do not know that, being a Universal International film, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both quite unknown at the time) have small roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence shows the first Indian attack, so CHARLES DRAKE turns out to be a coward who runs away, leaving Shelley alone in the horse-drawn carriage. He later redeems himself, but it's just one of the twists and turns that the weapon moves from one disgusting hand to another - but it finally ends with the rightful owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic (but not totally) as the end of the DUEL IN THE SUN guns. McNally makes the perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the kind of villain role he played throughout the 1940s as a low life gunslinger. <br /> <br /> The well-constructed story is extremely well directed by Anthony Mann, and it's fun to watch ROCK HUDSON (credited as Young Bull) using Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier casting glances of longing for the then slender and attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing and definitely an above average story.
