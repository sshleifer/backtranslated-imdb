As a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG constantly surprises me. I mean, after you've seen him shift from laughter to paranoia instantly over the seasons and after every little gesture of yours has made you believe he's a gangster, you thought, OK, he's a good actor and can get into the skin of a gangster. But after seeing him open his eyes and fighting for his life, I mean I could almost feel the pain he "made" believe us he was passing. I was so thrilled by the performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more so. But nowadays they are old or dead (Brando) and it is certain that they make fewer films and their performances are "lighter" than they used to be. I can not wait to see Gandolfini in other films, where he offers a totally different role. Can you recommend me some of your older movies where it gives a memorable performance?
