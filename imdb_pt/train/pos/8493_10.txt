This is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when it was released. I just saw this movie again and it still reminds me of it. Many movies that we watched when we were younger do not seem to hold back when we see them later in life. The film is actually a great example of the 1980s the kind of films made then. Keaton is at his best, all the actors really did a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at letting the story push the movie instead of forcing it. The pace of the movie is fast, with few slow points and seeing the cars of the 80's is very funny. Being from the 80's I loved seeing the ugly pacer again. The film is a great movie for any comedy lover and cinephile of the 80s.
