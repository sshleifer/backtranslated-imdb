Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the best directors in Hollywood history, but this movie proves he is. Already a success in making sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve, as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar, Mankiewicz does a wonderful job in bringing this Broadway success to the cinema and does it in style . Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson, even though he can not sing very well. He is the only actor who achieved this perfectly with his pure coolness and clarity. Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer, as expected, and does a good job as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando chia with great chemistry. All the supporting actors play their part, especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny part. Still, Mankiewicz should receive most of the credit for bringing a good musical in himself to the screen in such a way that he feels authentic in many scenes, but it is still a story in his own world. All in all, Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels you normally should not have.
