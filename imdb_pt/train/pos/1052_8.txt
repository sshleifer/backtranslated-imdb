A noteworthy documentary on the landmark achievements of the Kumba Women's Lawyers Association (WLA) in southwest Cameroon, which legally protects the rights of women and children to domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. After 17 years of failed efforts, WLA leaders have recently started winning some victories, and the goal of this film is to share these winning stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa. , a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (president of the court). Both feature in this film, which may contain scenes shot spontaneously, although I imagine that much if not all of this consists of subsequent re-creations of actual events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all complainants also appear in the film. Two cases involve repeated beatings of women, with violent sex in one case; another involves forced sex in a 10-year-old girl; and yet another relates to the repeated beating of an 8-year-old child by an aunt. One of the battered wives is also seeking a divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the results of the studies. The results in each case are favorable for women and children. The perpetrators receive prison sentences and / or severe fines; Divorce is guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The aggressive trial of the child who beat up the aunt demonstrates that these criminal justice officials are indeed gender neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a very important and well done film. (Interestingly, one of the directors, Ms. Longinotto, also co-directed the 1998 film, Divorce, Iranian Style, which dealt with related issues in Tehran.) (In English with broken captions). My grade: B + 8/10
