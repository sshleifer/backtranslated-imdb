This is a very difficult film, and it is almost impossible to understand what is happening. At first it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a guy (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and a little crassly invites himself to one when the current tenant (a woman) commits suicide. Then the twists and turns begin. Are the neighbors trying to kill you? And why are the dead tenant's clothes showing up in the apartment? One might ask, finally, if Trelkovsky is the previous tenant. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks that Polanski does is lie to us. We assume when we see things from a character's point of view that we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality. We assume when the camera is showing us things from his omniscient point of view that we see the reality - but Polanski has the camera lie to us.
