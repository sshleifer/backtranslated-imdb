Steve Carell once again stars in a romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. In judging the storyline and cover art of the film, I was expecting a laid-back comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Of course the movie had some comedy, but it seemed a lot lighter and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The film itself really addresses true observations and this was a strong element that I found. But the end seemed a little rushed and predictable. All the while, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it conveyed was obvious, but still very important. However, it has reached the old, flat and predictable end. I would say that if different choices were made at the end of the movie (maybe even for the bad, even), this movie would have better publicity. It's still a fun movie.
