Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard of losing a co-worker who had obvious differences of opinion about entertainment, he loved it. Well, I watched an episode or 2 early in the season and was bored, so I hung up. After a few years, I stumbled into the lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow I was surprised. You can tell gravity well, damn I was sucked in. The pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward / backs are so with the characters licking, but above all good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin and Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are definitely immature, very spoiled and immature donkeys. Kate 1 step above them, Juliet was a lot smarter than Kate. Mr. Eko way under-rated and at the level of Charlie, if not more, too bad that both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a real curiosity. As a large whole, very layered series: looking for more. <br /> <br />
