One of the things that interested me most about this movie is the way the characters and their associated stories are developed on the fly. I suppose the writers wanted us to become interested in the characters by not forcing their characters. The premise of using the art and crafts of furniture design and construction was a theme and / or a unique analogy for what families / siblings spend in life. The complexity of having a twin brother as surrogate father and even husband added great strain to make this movie emotionally interesting. Moreover, although the story was not one that the masses could relate to directly (that is, Jews / twins / family businesses), the themes are quite universal, since every family has a black sheep in it. This made it very interesting.
