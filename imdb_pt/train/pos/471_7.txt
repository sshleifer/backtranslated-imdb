This movie stars Emily Watson from Breaking the Waves. This movie about a man's obsession happens at a resort where a chess tournament is being held. A chess master arrives and soon falls madly in love (at first sight) with a woman, played by Emily Watson. She falls in love with this eccentric man, obsessed with chess. This is all the dismay of her mother, who is more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; a good gentleman. His mother feels that this is only a passing fantasy for the young woman, since she has a tendency to receive strange animals and things like that. What follows is mainly a journey through the psyche of man. It tells the story of how your past is closely linked to your present. Emily Watson is amazing at this, as is the actor who plays the main character. It's definitely slow, but worth seeing. The end was even satisfactory. :)
