One word can describe this movie and this is strange. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old, so I thought it would be interesting. Well, the movie is about a kid who travels the universe to get a metal body to get revenge. Along the way, he finds very colorful characters and must decide whether or not the body. Very odd, if you are a fan of animation / science fiction, you might want to check this out.
