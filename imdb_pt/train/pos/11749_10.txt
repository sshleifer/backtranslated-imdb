Finally we have a TV series where we can see the acting talent! The first episode was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, there was still the "I'm not your father - I'm your father and alligator you betrayed me!" trash, but the script allowed the actors to really feel and live those real moments, instead of showing us what it would be like - as many TV soaps do. <br /> <br /> Camera work also gave us a bit more than usual, there were no boring pictures of repeated angles for hours, but there were no 'unnecessary shots inside shots or hand camera crap' for adding an "artistic" edge gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful pictures as well! <br /> <br /> Nothing was super dramatized or melodramatic, they were real people in a real place, dealing with real situations, the show had nothing of drama and was completely relevant. It was a relief to be exposed to real acting and it's so good to let our country see how talented our actors can be when they get a real screenplay, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, Channel Ten and all the cast and crew for wonderful work! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are greatly appreciated and do not go unnoticed!
