If you want to watch something that is for 'him' and 'her', so to speak, then this is the movie to choose from. I am a sucker for coms rom but my husband is not always so interested (what a dude !!!). Anyway I got him to watch because I told him it was about sport, and you know what, he loved it !!! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and his protagonist (sorry, but may not remember his name) is equally good. When I watched the movie, it was called 'The Perfect Match', but I think the title was changed to the UK because it's based on the book Fever Pitch and there was already a movie made about football with that title (the same movie but the UK version - phew!), <br /> <br /> Anyway, all the comments here will tell you more details if you need them, buy girls, get it out of me, bring your husband / boyfriend in front of television. one Saturday night and you two will laugh and cry together. A real gem.
