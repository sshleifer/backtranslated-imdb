I got to this great show in season 4 and since then I've seen all the episodes have all the episodes on DVD and it keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. Now it may not have Richard Dean Anderson now but the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black still gave the show more strength and original still after 10 seasons. Unfortunately now the sci-fi channel got rid of this incredible show with no relay hope for a season of 11 there are two straight to the DVD movie and I expect more. Atlantis is still strong in its 4 seasons. And there is a third development in the works that the Stargate franchise is far from dead. This TV show is a must see for all science fiction fans and people of genres because it has such a wide range of things to suit all ages and all kinds of people Watch IT !!!!! 10/10
