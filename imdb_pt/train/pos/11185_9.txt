As this is one of the most favorite novels, I was very excited to see the change. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are some things I could choose from, but I think the film was true to the book and it was a very good movie. It seems that Stephen King's films mostly have a negative review, but this is one of the good ones. It's such a dark story that I think that's why I like it ... and what's better than the dead come to life ... and something about the animals coming back from the grave is pretty scary too. If you saw the movie do a huge favor and now read the book !! It's a well written play, the actors could have done a better job (I only say this to Rachel, and Ellie .. she was so boring) I really enjoyed all the others .. and most importantly to me .. was stuck true with the novel.
