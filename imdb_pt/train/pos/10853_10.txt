This movie is great for animating spirits. Every time I watch, I see and hear funny things that I missed before. The soundtrack is unbelievable. Mick Jones (Foreign) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote the songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing that ever hit the music scene today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly fictional album from the 60s to the 70s. It was never a good band to start because of drug use and struggle. We wondered what might have happened as we listened to her fantastic soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The Fruit is inspired by the Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> The fruit member is completely memorable. Stephen Rea plays Tony Costello, who is invited by a festival promoter to gather his band for a reunion tour, hoping to reap monetary benefits. Costello approaches former roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him reignite the flame of a dream that has long passed. <br /> <br /> Juliet meets the bitter Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes), unbalancing Timothy Spall (David 'Beano' Baggot) and Ray Simms (Bill Nighy), extravagantly glamorous. Another ex-roadie, the hippie-playful Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never lets the flame burn. <br /> <br /> As Juliet searches for the last member of his heterogeneous band, the indescribable guitarist and guitarist Brian Lovell (played by Bruce Robinson), the assembled members fight, just like in the old days, fighting over the rusty talent of each one. <br /> <br /> The band has the chance to do a little Dutch tour to prepare for the festival. With young Luke Shand (Hans Matheson) taking the place of Lovell, the crew arrives on the road. Sparks fly as their memories approach, threatening to burn their unfinished goals ... Be prepared to laugh, sing, clap and weep as these memorable characters return to their hearts. .
