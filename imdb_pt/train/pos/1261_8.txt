I really liked this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) give credible performances, and Harris is pleasantly exaggerated. The lighting and shooting angles in some of Harris's scenes make his face look truly devilish. The surprising twist in the end makes it interesting. Not a great movie, but a nice movie. I gave 7 out of 10.
