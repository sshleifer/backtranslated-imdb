Every once in a while a filmmaker gives life to a single group of people and lets you in to see the things that make us human. Lawrence Kasden did it again. I always felt that Bg Cill was the anthem of his age and he managed to do it again in the Grand Canyon. From time to time, we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and we often blow it up. This is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice. The juxtaposition of small and large events that allows us to see how basically trivial most of the things we care about is truly great. I've watched this movie several times and I'm constantly amazed at how deep the emotions are in this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline play their roles with great tenderness, and Stever Martins' picture of a movie executive is priceless. Thanks again Mr. Kasden
