As a community theater actor who works hard for this, but does not take the action very seriously, I always have fun with those who treat him like Great Art. This movie spits the "Actor's Office" mercilessly, as it makes a lot of laughs good. <br /> <br /> A local ham actor for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator. When the dictator dies of heart attack because of a lot of food and drink, the actor is kidnapped and forced to play "part of his life" by the neo-Nazi secret service chief. He plays to the end, makes the dictator's girlfriend fall in love with him and vice versa, and turns the table into his captors beautifully. Much incredible stuff on the slopes, a lot of good work by some unfamiliar supporting actors, particularly the domestic staff and two palace guards, and small, fun apparitions are plentiful. Sammy Davis Jr. does little of himself, Jonathan Winters plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else going on, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and, above all, Richard Dreyfuss are exceptional. <br /> <br /> This is a silent movie, but it has many beautiful places (in Brazil), a good humorous script, and good actors doing their thing and looking like they are really having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what it's just about to impersonate!
