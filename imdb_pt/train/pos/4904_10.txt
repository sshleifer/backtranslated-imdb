Delightful in every way, this movie is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good. If you like jazz, you must see it. If you enjoy seeing adorable characters that make you smile, you can bring a tear to your eyes and sway like there's no tomorrow this movie is for you. If you're looking for an intense, deep, and heavy work of art to be dissected and analyzed, it might be best to stick with something from Darren Aronofsky (in other words - djjohn's reviewer lights up, you do not have fun when you see one! Only complaint is that the movie was very short. I think I'll have to watch it several more times to satisfy myself.
