Typical comedy from the 90's, situational similar to our modern day "my family". Thatcher is at the peak of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for anything she can. "Bloody Thatcher" possibly shared with most of us. David, the typical teenager, cutting brains with knives of bread, Jenny, the older and sulky teenager, interested only in boys and more boys. Bill and Ben work as hard as they can to keep their family in trouble in the economic climate of the early 1990s. Granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter, however, series 3 onwards is where it all starts with more laughter than I would like to tell. Overall, this show did not have the best showing times and they should have stayed a bit longer. clearly they could not have continued after Gary Olsen died, but I think they should get rid of "Catherine Tate" "the office" "Little Britain" and bring back the classics!
