"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first colored film by Master Akira Kurosawa and, surprisingly, it is not about samurai, ronins, warlords or battlefields. It is within a very poor community in a shantytown in Tokyo, where the locals are homeless drunks, beggars, vagabonds, battered women, losers. I do not know the reason why Kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors on, but in fact they are very sad stories, some of them heartbreaking. I personally enjoy the touching story of the boy and his father who dream of a home of their own and built by them; the story of the retarded boy who believes he is riding a train; the story of the man who raised five children as if they were his own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden? The Way of Life" ("Dodeskaden? The Way of Life")
