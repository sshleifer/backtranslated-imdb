Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. I usually do not choose military / war movies, but this was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was funny too. Beringer's character proved to be heroic and honest. No matter what, you know he has your back. <br /> <br /> Zane's character developed throughout the film. He was not just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and deal with a gun. <br /> <br /> The end through me a little. It really was not with the action throughout the movie, but I'm glad I saw it, though. <br /> <br /> Worth checking out.
