"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is based on a book by Italian composer Luciano Ligabue, who also directs the film and records the soundtrack - of course. <br /> <br /> The film is a portrait of life in the northern province of Italy in the Emilia Romagna region. We are in 1975, the time of the first free radios - one of the boys of the film creates "Radioraptus". Youth desires, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes, but the film also talks about drugs -Freccia, the main character, is a victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> Without being boring and moralistic, the story flows very well; the spontaneity of the actors is strong and the way to drive as well. Obviously Luciano "Liga" Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a film professional, first of all he is a musician. But he can make a good product. Unfortunately he will not repeat success with his second film "From zero to dieci" - not good at all. In "Radiofreccia" actors are generally not very famous, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. See in a little paper another Italian composer -Francesco Guccini, he is the bartender and nice communist football coach!
