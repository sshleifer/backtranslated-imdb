This is one of those movies that made me feel strongly about the need to make movies. Overall, I'm a fan of movies based on real and decent stories. And this is great! In addition to Meryl's performance, which has garnered much recognition and praise, the film's greatest asset is the story on which it is based. The fascinating tale of a couple who suffers social and legal torture, after having suffered tremendous emotional pain with the unexpected and brutal death of their baby, is really a revealing fable that exposes the inhuman side of other humans and uncovers the barbarity of a society very refined and legal. It is interesting to see how people who consider themselves to be gentle and intelligent people (the women of the emotional jury in the film, for example) are really nothing more than selfish idiots who, by their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, close their brains to any deliberation. and contemplation, even in the light of all the facts pointing clearly against their opinions. The other face of the so-called "civilized" society that the film exposes is apathy to the pain of human beings (needless to say, this is very general, even though this particular story unfolds in Australia), which goes as far as becoming true cruelty. Must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought-provoking.
