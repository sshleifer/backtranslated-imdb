I do not know who could find flaws in a movie simply human and funny like this, with many delights for your heart. I enjoyed every minute and guessed the ending in the middle of the movie - but that did not disappoint me. Not only will it touch your heart, but it's such a good movie for the family - we need a lot more like these!
