The 14 year old in me is immensely happy for now they can make very good fantasy films, and that they are all the rage, with the Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia doing a lot of things. money at the box office. This year we will see (and have already seen) several others, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I did not see any preview for this, just a couple of commercials. Critical reaction is kind of blah. I would not have even seen it if it were not for the fact that I have to wait for a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing more interesting opened up this weekend. Well, if you forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been correctly aligned because I went to see the Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like The Lord of the Rings. The plot is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero goes out in search of a fallen star) full of obstacles. But within this basic scheme, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply meant to be a lot of fun and a lovely little novel. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of great movies this summer, but none of them were as fun as this. There is a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It's not a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of terrain that something like The Princess Bride has (though I do not like it as much as the previous movie). Lots of fun to have here if you are a fan of the genre.
