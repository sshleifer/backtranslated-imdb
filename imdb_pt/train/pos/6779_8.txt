George Cukor directs a melancholic and cynical classic. The Ronald Coleman badge is at its best in this Noir play about an actor who gets lost in his roles. The acclaimed Anthony John (Colman) took his wife Brita (Signe Hasso) though with his highly-fed temper and erratic behavior. But the two can continue to work together to please their audience. Things start to change as John gets annoyed with his career; he reluctantly agrees to play Othello. He dives into the character as a jealous and murderous man. He begins to walk a fine line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his lover (Shelley Winters), but has no memory of the coward act. <br /> <br /> Colman seems blameless in this role. Winters is very impressive as the young determined to flee her miserable life. Also in the cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawyer and Whit Bissell.
