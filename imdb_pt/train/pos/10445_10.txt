First, let me say that Before Sunrise, like all movies, is NOT a movie for all tastes. It seems that some people are less clever in recognizing this fact, but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of disgust that this harmless little movie generates of some people. For me, like most people here, before sunrise touched me deeply, I was really shocked, moved, inspired by him. This is a movie that ends up benefiting from more than one preview. It creates some of the most unforgettable feelings and emotions you can imagine. It is impossible to imagine this world without thinking of the kind of inspiring feeling I have of it. <br /> <br /> The film works as a communion of two fragile souls who begin to know each other. It is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in how a conversation necessarily connects with the next, or the meaning of the topics of the discussions of Jesse and Celine, but the small nuances, the perfectly articulated answers that they provoke each other. It captures an honest, romantic, but fleeting human emotion that is beginning to flourish in the incredibly sublime Viennese environment; convinces us that their evanescent relationship may be the highest compliment in the world. And what happens after that night is open for debate, but I never doubt they will not come back to each other. <br /> <br /> RockytheBear and User's easy comments below are impossible examples of a doctrinal dissenter who is not willing to accept and respect those who love this movie. <br /> <br /> Look and it can change your way of life.
