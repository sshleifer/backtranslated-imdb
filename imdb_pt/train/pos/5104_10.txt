This is a clever drama about the way of life in Texas in the early 1980s. John Travolta and Debra Winger perform two very convincing performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the scene of country music and helped introduce America to the mechanical bull. If you love a good romance movie then you will love this movie.
