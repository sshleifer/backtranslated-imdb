Just joking about the weight loss thing; well, you can lose weight, you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. It has the same sense of youthfulness and innocence found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of the simple things in life and how often we ignore them. The movie reminds us of what it is like to see the world through the eyes of children and all the magic, mystery and horror they perceive. Jake's closet presents an uniquely human tale in his compassion that anyone who has had a childhood can relate to and fall in love with. Watch with friends; observe with your loved ones; Build a strong - wine optional.
