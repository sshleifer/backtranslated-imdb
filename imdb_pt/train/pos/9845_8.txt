I'm not going to lie, this is a great movie. I saw about 4 months ago at my local theater. I saw it a second time, and I was a little bored in the slow scenes. Sid (sloth) is not that flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is very good in the movie. The animation is great and the story has a touching ending. It pays to take kids 10 years or younger, but teenagers would probably find it a little annoying. In addition, the uniqueness of the characters is so interesting. Like I said, it's a very good movie, but I'd rate Toy Story 2 or Shrek higher. 8/10
