Freddy Krueger the dream stalker from Elm Street returns, the great character actor Robert Englund is back in this sequel to Nightmare 5, Son of Dream. I hope to have the number correctly. There have been so many, and this is one of the best, especially for the cameo by: Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) tom Arnold, johnny depp, (who made the first nightmare at 84) Alice Cooper (singer) you'll see Freddy as a tormented child, a teenager who loves pain, and as a family guy (scary) effects are very funny and creative, the cast also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) breckin Meyer (travel) yaphet kotto (alien, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (father knows best) I was One of the people who saw this in 3d, well, the ending.i love 3d movies.i lost the first 3D wave in 1953 (I had not even been born yet) the second wave was in 1983.i like all Freddy movies. this stands out as one of the best, not to mention the first that was absolutely brilliant, Freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s, along with Jason voorhees, Chucky, Micheal Myers and leather face. Can you imagine a movie with all of them? I recommend this to all Freddy fans and horror fans. That Freddy is such a cut 8 out of 10.
