What a great British film, a lively laugh and sexy Gary Stretch too, and many bikes and lovely Welsh countryside. <br /> <br /> Members of our club, the ARROWHEAD Bike and the Trike Social Club, appear on it as extras! Alive !! <br /> <br /> There are some genuinely hilarious moments, good acting, a good idea. <br /> <br /> He met director Jon Ivay at a presentation in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, to earth and a good laugh. This movie should be supported, as all the great British films should! <br /> <br /> So, please go and see if you can, they have a website with cinemas they are showing, so find one near you! <BR> I can not wait to get the DVD. Some of our biker friends have seen the movie two or three times and they do not get tired of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
