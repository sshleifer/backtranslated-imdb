BASEketball is actually a very funny movie. David Zucker manages to make us all laugh out of our heads again, in a really silly but often clever comedy. <br /> <br /> The 2 creators of South Park, the main actors in this movie, play very well. , surprisingly good actually, but this is the first time I see them as actors. The movie often reminded me of South Park - one of my favorite shows. <br /> <br /> It's a very good and funny movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
