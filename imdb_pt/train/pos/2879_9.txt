Do not worry, Disney fans - this special edition of the beloved Cinderella's DVD will not turn into a pumpkin on the midnight strike. One of the most enduring animated films of all time, the fictional adaptation of the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale has become a classic in itself, thanks to some memorable songs (including "A dream is a wish your heart makes" , "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo," and the title song) and some lovingly cute comic relief. We all know the story - the mean stepmother and half sisters just will not have it, this uppity Cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the beautiful prince a proper sweetheart, but perseverance, animal friends, and a well timed entry by a fairy godmother, make sure things go well. There are some stunning sequences of pure animation - for example, Cinderella is reflected in bubbles floating in the air - and the design is rich and evocative throughout. It's a simple story padded here according to the comics, particularly Cinderella's rodent friends (dressed visibly as the dwarven companions of another famous Disney heroine) and her misadventures with a miserable cat named Lucifer. There is also much excitement and exposure spewing out by the king and the Grand Duke. It's a much simpler and gratifying job than today's most frenetic animated films, which makes it both unique and highly rewarding at the same time.
