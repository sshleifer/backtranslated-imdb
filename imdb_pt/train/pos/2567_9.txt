James Michener's books taking readers to faraway places with odd names were probably the most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His Tales of the South Pacific became a big Broadway hit for Rodgers & Hammerstein. The South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and it was natural to make the film adaptation of another hit by Michener, Sayonara. <br /> <br /> It was only a decade before American films during World War II did not portray the Japanese. gently I'm sure it was not easy for people who fought in the Pacific war to change their attitudes overnight. This is a general policy of non-fraternization with the occupied peoples in general at the heart of this story about the interracial romance. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is a relevant movie nowadays. The military has always intruded into the personal lives of its personnel so that no civilian employer could legally escape. In America at the time Sayonara was made, there were still laws of miscegenation in books in many states. Today gays in the military is a big problem. Someone may someday make a Sayonara type movie about it. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on familiar ground. The South Pacific also had racism as a component of its plot. With a confident hand, Logan set up a great cast and produced a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner and Kent Smith some of the western players do a great job. But the photo is stolen by the Orientals here. Miko Taka hits the mark beautifully as Brando's love interest. But the real stars are the two supporting the Oscars, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. <br /> <br /> Buttons is your Air Force member. He falls passionately in love with Katsumi played by Miyoshi Umeki. They marry and the military does everything they can to destroy them. They presume to know what is best for Buttons and Umeki. Button was a TV comedian and a special talent, but never got as good a role as this in the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> And Miyoshi Umeki's Oscar was the first given to an Oriental. He drew a lot of attention because at the time of the Oscar, Miyoshi was starring on Broadway in Flower Drum Song. I had the privilege of seeing it on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I have ever seen. I still carry the memory of that. <br /> <br /> That Oscar symbolized something else as well. Our war with Japan was really over and we saw in Sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, an actor in the Kabuki theater. If Sayonara were made today, Logan would never get along. But Montalban is fine. <br /> <br /> Photograph of good location and a great history. This movie must be revived more often, it has a great moral.
