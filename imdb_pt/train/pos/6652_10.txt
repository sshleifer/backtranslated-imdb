I saw the movie and really could not stop my tears. Their tragedy is that India has no such leaders after freedom, who dares to do justice to their own children when they do not behave properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children into politics without measuring their caliber and skills. Gandhi's dialogue 'What kind of society do we want to create / do with these people (about Harilal)?' No wonder it is a dream that India will hardly have such a leader in this or the next generation. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi that "after 50 years he would hardly believe that such a person had body, soul and mind" Gandhi) had already lived on this earth. I sincerely want to thank Anil Kapoor, Feroze Khan and all the movie actors / actresses for this wonderful film about great person and relationship with their son. Every parent and child should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.
