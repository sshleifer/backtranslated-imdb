I question someone saying they do not care about this movie. Some commentators said they did not have enough action, some said it was too long, etc. Do not listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you will definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> The acting performances are superb! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are all superb and Liam Neeson does a remarkable job and is a very imposing character due to his size. Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. It's one of the few movies I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank), which was practically flawless in casting, directing, writing, acting, and so on. <br /> <br /> I was amazed this was not in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed. I felt so in love that I just signed up for IMDB so everyone could know the real hole. I've seen this movie about 10 times (each time with a different person) and everyone loved it! You should be awake and watch carefully in the first 30 minutes as they introduce some characters in the beginning. If you have longer attention span than most of these young children writing reviews for the movies on this site then you will love this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the Matrix in # 32?!?! This should show the age range of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This is a top 50 movie !!!
