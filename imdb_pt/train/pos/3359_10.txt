Una giornata particolare is a film that made a brilliant use of enclosed spaces. It is in these vague and empty spaces that the public sees the emotional turmoil and violent outbursts of Ettore Scola's two main characters. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren interpret two frustrated individuals who decide to join together for some brief moments of their lives without attachment. It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them. All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character. women would surely cry for their hearts in the face of the existential situation of Marcello Mastroianni. Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues in this somber and moving film. Most characters face issues related to their own sexualities. The ingenia can not be called a gay film pro, although it has been well described that a homosexual mingles well with women. This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has created a pretty good mix of facts and fiction. His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed the fate of ordinary Italian citizens. A word about the brave person played magnificently by the great Marcello Mastroianni. He acts like a real man. does not ask for pity. He happily accepts his fate and prepares to face the worst moment of his short but significant life. A true masterpiece of cinema !!!
