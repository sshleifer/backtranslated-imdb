Excellent film that deals with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years. Beginning around 1910, he recalls his son and young adulthood; your family, friends, romance, etc. Order a lot of nostalgic with a bittersweet ending ... "All the things of life come together as one, and a river passes through it. And that river haunts me." Worth seeing.
