This is one of the great comedy films of Sammo. This is not a parody of entering the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him frighteningly well for a man of his size. Nominal story about how your struggle continues to cause problems for your loved ones - then fighting. Oh, the fight. Good and fast scenes with high impact (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt with one of Sammo's kicks). <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie was purely unintentional. There's a guy who looks at Jim Kelly (one of the three hired specialists to take Sammo out), but he was a blackface Chinese guy with an afro wig. Come on, they did not have real black guys in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've seen quite a few "Chinese people" fake as hell in old American movies as well. <br /> <br /> This is one for any fan of Sammo or Bruce Lee.
