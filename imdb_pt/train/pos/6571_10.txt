<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I own Jake Speed. I've seen it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the most fun movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. Her sister was kidnapped in Paris and the family did not hear anything. Jake comes along with Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), telling him exactly where his sister is and making an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He does not work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes his adventures in novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's hilarious, full of action, great. I think it's a cult movie with a little cult following. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws some one-liners you'll never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as the girl and the helper, respectively. John Hurt, the guy with the exploded stomach in Alien, plays the devilish, perverted villain who only adds to the fun. In many ways, this movie is similar to Indiana Jones, in some ways, it is similar to James Bond films. Maybe it should have been called Indiana Bond, but whatever the title is, it's a very nice film.
