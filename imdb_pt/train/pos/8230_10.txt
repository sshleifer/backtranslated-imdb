Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about small crimes that ordinary people commit that in a crazy setting can lead to absolute disaster. One of the smartest Greek series ever! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible 'guilt' laughing. All the spectators seemed to recognize the bad side of themselves in one of the characters or at least a side of themselves they wished to have. Actors of all ages who played major and minor parts have gained an equally large spot in the heart of the Greek public. My personal favorites (besides the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but so many amazing actors have gone through a few episodes from time to time. Whoever in all the world understands that the Greek must find a way to watch this series, even if he has spent more than 5 years on TV. In Greece, they continue to repeat the series (ANT1) at every opportunity, such as summer or early afternoon. We will never forget Eglimata or any of the cast crew!
