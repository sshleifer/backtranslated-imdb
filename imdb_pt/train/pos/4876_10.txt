I do not know why some guys from the United States, Georgia or even from Bulgaria have the guts to express feelings about something they do not understand. For those who did not watch this movie - watch. Do not expect too much or do not put some structures just because this is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand all the humor inside - the people of Serbia actually got married while Bil Clinton bombs their villages, gypsies in all Balkans ALWAYS try to fool you the way they can, LOVE is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who claim that this is a bad movie, I can only see that the American sh * t (such as Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) is far worse than a pure and sincere humorous film from the Balkans as Promise me. The commentary should be helpful and secondly it should represent the writer's personal vision. I think the movie is great and people watching should give their respects to the director and the story told inside. It's simple, but it's true. It's brutal, but gentle and makes you laugh to die.
