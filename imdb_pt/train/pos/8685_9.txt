This was the first episode of the Columbus movie, but it still aired as second, after Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: Murder by the Book." It is also at the same time among one of the best! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a great creative director! No wonder they later asked him to direct three more of Columbus's films. The film has some creative and innovative shooting scenes and the film as a whole is also clearly done with style, passion and attention to detail. Each shot connects and is one reason why this movie is better and also better looking any other medium made for the TV movie. It is definitely one of the best films of Columbus. <br /> <br /> It's an original Columbus entrance for some reasons. Murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act. So the killer this time does not have time to plan the "perfect murder" in advance and to cleanse the traces and have to discard the body. The killer in this movie is not only being treated as the man who committed the crime, but more like the man who helps Lieutenant Colonel Columbo solve the crime. This makes the character more interesting and layered, and also helps to make Columbo solve the whole crime also seems much more interesting because of it. Of course Columbo begins to distrust him too soon and as usual he comes to the solution, becoming vulnerable and looking more stupid than he is, of course, and gaining the killer's trust. This obviously is not a spoiler, because that's how every movie Columbus is installed. I liked the story of the movie and how it progressed. <br /> <br /> It also helps the film to have such a good cast. At the time of this film, Peter Falk had actually created the character Columbo and the character was already fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as short-lived Brimmer. The funny thing is that he would later star in three different Columbus films again and an episode of "Mrs. Columbus" only in totally different roles. He even played the killer in some of those movies again. He, by the way, was not the only actor who did this in other later films of Columbus. Also the great Ray Milland makes an appearance in this film, as the husband of the victim. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie from Columbus and among the best in the long series of films. .9 / 10
