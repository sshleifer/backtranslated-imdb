You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield did a really good thing, it's 10 out of 10, so I can not believe the other user on this web ranked him so poor unless they expected to see only a normal movie with people, scenes from love and so on. I'm also convinced that this kind of documentary is a great way to wake us up to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" made mostly of long monologues, painfully and with "truths" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed out. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on earth is not to lose the Earth.
