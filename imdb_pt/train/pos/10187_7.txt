Well, I'll be honest: it's not exactly a Sholay. But you can not receive a Sholay every week. In fact, you can see distinct signatures of "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as most of the "inspired" films go, this one was well-inspired, well-treated and well done. Nana Patekar, as always, tends to exaggerate hysteria, but all others are commendable. Especially about Dipti Naval: I saw her after a long time, but she did not lose anything of her grace. In fact, she did much better when I last saw her. Another of the Bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they grow older? <br /> <br /> All in all, a good watch.
