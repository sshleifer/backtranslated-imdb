When I saw commercials for this I was thinking "NO WHAT NICK NITE HAS DONE!" because it was occupying the "fresh prince" slots. Well, I still love the new prince. but george lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how non-stereotyped benny is. Carmen is a very good character, it's really funny to see how stupid and super emotional she can be sometimes. I feel bad for the guy who plays max, he looks so much younger than he is! but Max is a fun character and acted well. and yes, angie is a little stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a big head! nah, but it can be very good too. funny show It should definitely be more often then home improvement.
