Being a person who usually does not like boxing movies, feeling that they only focus on boxing and not the characters, this movie really thrilled me. I loved being able to see the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) go through so many things in such a short time, it was incredible for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) did such a wonderful job playing Diana, especially since this was her first acting experience, she showed the real thrill and portrayed Diana wonderfully. All the actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing. I highly recommend this movie, even for those who do not usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
