I liked the movie and would suggest it to someone just for a long time. Do not take the movie too seriously because you remember it's Disney and it's rated G. It's good fun, although parts may be recognized by adults, but kids would never notice, particularly the "triangle" between Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella. valet Alonso. Glenn Close is fantastic and really made Cruella herself and is incredibly terrifying even when she is "cured" of her loving habits, she can instill fear in the audience with her havoc that literally shakes the theater. (I even found myself jumping into my seat when she catches you by surprise with her 'bipolarity' like the dog loving Ella.) All in all I'll see it again in theaters, I caught myself enjoying it so much.
