BOMB = Not of a visible quality. <br /> <br /> - Kalifornia = *** <br /> <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I rented this movie expecting a face-to-face celebration of Brad Pitt, but I was happily surprised and disappointed. This really is more of a drama, and very sad about it ... I remember some emotionally intense voices of Duchovny. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays his possibly no-sexiest movie ever with amazing talent. Who began as a hopeless but harmless husband of "white trash," became a violent and disturbing alcoholic with a confused mind. During some of the last stages of the film, I found it difficult to keep watching him - he was unpredictable and frightening. This proves very good writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is full of bizarre and sensational scenes that made me hold my breath no less than once, and I do not mean action scenes. I mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted that I really shuddered and gasped at what I was seeing. It was like watching a rhino and a lion placed in a cage and watching as they gnawed at each other to death. Again, I'm very impressed with the scriptwriter (s); whoever he was, did the impossible: he mixed oil and water. <br /> I also really enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is a joy. Some of your moments in this movie have brought me to tears. I mean that. The emotions that this girl can arouse in her head are incredible, and I clearly remember getting her eyes bulging at times. <br /> <br /> I almost feel like I'm betraying the quality skill that filmmakers have exhibited just by giving "KALIFORNIA" a rating ***. But the dark feelings she arouses are too strong and depressing to increase her. I believe everyone should see this movie. I really do.
