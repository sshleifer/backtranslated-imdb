(WARNING: minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I ran into this medium and watched from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. It certainly held my attention; I did not know until the end that it was based on a true story! The guy she used to do the dirty action came out looking like a seriously cool guy who just had her head twisted by a dishonest girl; I have to question how true to life this picture is. Anyone who killed husband and wife while they slept can not be entirely legal. Still, I had some sympathy for him, how he had been created and taken advantage of; That was very clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is with the ending (here comes the biggest spoiler! skip this paragraph if you do not want to learn). A few minutes before it was over, there seemed to be no way to find out the truth. The way it was discovered was in a "bite" operation, but my question is: how did the police convince themselves to go along with it? The film did not show us this, and it seemed a bit too convenient without the explanation of how they were persuaded to do so. <br /> <br /> I think the way they dealt with it was made for dramatic purposes, as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene that otherwise would not be there (we would have already known what the scene was about and what was going on with Brad in it). <br /> Otherwise, this is a very good movie; I give 7/10. That made me think. Now I'm interested in finding out the facts of the real case. <br /> <br /> One more thing: the movie was made in 1996. Some of the reviews here seem to treat it like a newer movie. PS Meadow Sisto is adorable. I had not seen her before. She can act a little too (always a plus in her line of work, LOL).
