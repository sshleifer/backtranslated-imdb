In fact, this movie has some silly moments, both in the claymation part and in Joe Pesci's part and children, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz," "Captain Eo," and "Ghosts." But as a Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yes, it's half my life, you guys!), I can not complain too much about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and listening to his wonderful music is a trip to heaven for me. But as a movie, it's not good, and I'm afraid, that would be a much lower rating for me, if my dear Mike had not been the protagonist. But since no one other than Mike is the moonwalker, he has to win 7 of 10 of me.
