In fact, a particular person / character is not "there", but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie. And all this is achieved with no camera movement and / or large production sets, but with a great story and very (believable) and good actors conveying the story (bow). <br /> <br /> You could call it a follow-up to great movies / movies in Japan (like Tokyo Story etc.), not so much in terms of history, of course, but also in terms of humor! Great performance, nuances in performances that are truly precious. If you are eager to experience a moving story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally then this is the one to go. As you noticed (as with many of my comments), I am not going into history. There are places here on IMDb where you can look for these, I'm not one to spoil the story whatsoever!
