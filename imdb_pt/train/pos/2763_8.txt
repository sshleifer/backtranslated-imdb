People tend to complain about the number of movies being made about people with mental disabilities. I do not see this as a valid criticism, no more than complaints from many films about any kind of person. Jaco van Dormael does a wonderful job with the script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work seamlessly together, with Duquenne basically playing himself. The film covers a surprisingly large scene of events and is not simply content to review what has been seen in "Rain Man". The ending is pretty depressing, but it does not spoil the wonderful story that came before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 of 10
