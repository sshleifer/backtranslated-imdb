This show began with great episodes of mystery. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the show started playing short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20 minutes of episodes into short episodes. Some of the voice actors were unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. I think Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes, because the first voice actor who played Velma was not available. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered Hanna Barbera's studio to shorten Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy doo, because ratings were high. So they had to make shorter. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. It's still a good show.
