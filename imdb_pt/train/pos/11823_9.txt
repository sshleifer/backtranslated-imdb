I really enjoyed this truth to form the character Dick Tracy. This is a well made product that used modern technology to create a comic book story filled with images. If you're a fan or recently watched some of Dick Tracy's old movies, then you're sure to enjoy this performance. The pastel colors and the larger-than-life characters rendered in a meticulous and authentic painting from a bygone era are entertainment as it should be. I personally think Madonna's musical element is an important part of this film - the CD with her music from this film is one I've listened to over the years, it's so well done and performed musically and tuned back then. In my opinion, Madonna's best moment on screen, but especially musically. This is sure to bring the "boy" into you.
