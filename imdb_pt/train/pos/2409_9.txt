This film has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people seeking temporal and cultural fidelity, but it challenges the observer to reflect on a variety of issues. One is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And third, it is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the relationship between Christ and the traitor is developed and maintained through the film. The passion of Judas is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the spectator can feel the anguish. Peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerfully portrayed as the drama of Judas. Chris Sarandon offers a new and provocative Christ, whether believable or not. I'd like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS, for use in study or discussion groups.
