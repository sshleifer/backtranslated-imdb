This has to be one of the best movies to get out of HK in a long time, I was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just by looking at the title. Loads of fantastic actors in this show and I was particularly impressed by Sam Lee's impossibly credible insane behavior and Edison's portrait of a killer machine that totally reversed his image as a normal idol. I would definitely recommend to those looking for a movie full of style and action. However, I must warn you, this is also an equally depressing film, as each character in the film is in some kind of dead-end and own problems, and struggling to breathe. It makes you think about what life really is.
