If you're a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or action in general, this is a must-see. Directed by the team of William Witney and John English, Republic, and starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series brings! I will not bore you with the plot (who cares? Less talking, more fighting); What really matters here is Hadley's excellent interpretation of the character and work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW YOU <br /> <br /> You can see the influence that this movie had on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro is caught in the original version of the Star Wars trash compactor in a chapter, trapped on a rope bridge to the Temple of Doom in another, makes a horse-trainer Raiders transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the bad guys knock down a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him, exactly as Mola Ram does for Indy in Temple of Doom. Besides all this, the action of the whip is great, because the Zorro disarms the villains, moves to the security, etc., with his faithful whip. Most of the sword work is fair, except in chapter one, which features a fantastic sword fight in a sword-choreographed cantina Ralph Faulkner, who makes a rare on-screen appearance like the evil Rodriguez. This was the first series I saw in Matin√©e no Bijou when I was a child and since then I am addicted to them. <br /> <br /> The Zorro Combat Legion offers "Z" products!
