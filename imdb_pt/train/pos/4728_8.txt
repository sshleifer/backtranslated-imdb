After seeing 'Break a Leg' in Vancouver at the launch party, I thought it was a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> I had some laughter and some apparitions (Eric Roberts in particular) were a scream. I have not heard of actual release date, although I have heard it's next. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it is mostly a vehicle for the characters and situations. The script is smooth and continuous, the plot unfolds effortlessly and the acting is comfortable and fresh. This movie has won at least one award from each of the film festivals in which it has participated, which are about 10 - 15 or more. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'Break a Leg'.
