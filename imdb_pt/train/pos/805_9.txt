"Return of the Jedi" is often remembered for what he did wrong, not for what he did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological part of the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic narrative. He can finish all the stories of the previous films in a grand finale, and he does it very convincingly. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks-cute, cuddly bears that probably served to broaden the demographics of Star Wars. - and in between the film tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes across Darth Vader, the most well-known villain in movie history. <br /> <br /> The return of the Jedi did many things that people tend to ignore: it presented an incredible conclusion to the plot of Darth Vader (which went from a little implausible in the "Empire Strikes Back" to much convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance by Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming to his, solving Solo's novel Leia, and the extremely powerful final moments on Endor's moon. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are slight hassles. But they are the hassles of a generation of viewers who have had time to analyze each scene. It is still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. Not a "good" movie - it's fantastic!
