I must say that this movie is truly amazing and moving. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not so bad! it's so sweet to watch Dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and still warms my heart while watching Court fall in love with Maureen. However, it's even sweeter to see how much he cares about Dani. I must admit that I kind of want him to fall in love with Dani in the end. It's so cute watching her fall in love with him, I did not want her to break her heart so much. but the biggest tragedy I've ever seen occurred in this movie. Watching him die made me cry for a whole day. I just could not believe it. However, never a more loving relationship was shown in a movie, then Maureen and Dani. they really can go through anything. I'm giving this movie a 9 because I did not want Court to die, but it was still one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.
