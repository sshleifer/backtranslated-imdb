Remember "The Invisible Man" by H. Wells? Well, here's another movie like that, just more extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. At first, making the whey was the easy part, making the person come back was not. Most early attempts were unstable. Until one night, when he perfected the formula. And who else, but Caine would be the lab rat. The gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he arrived, it was a close one. So when Caine did, he decided to use it for fun. Then, when he got tired of not being seen, the team did their best to bring him back to the world of flesh. However, the visibility formula does not work the way it should, and Caine plunges into madness. So he ends up being a crazy invisible killer. It would be best to just leave the city instead of taking the lives of the people who are close to you. I would care less about those who made a mistake. Great movie, great fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
