24 is the best TV show !!!!! It's an incredible TV series with incredible suspense, great plots and unforgettable characters. And the first episode of all is my best evidence. Because it's just the first episode, just the introduction, and you're hooked because of the plot and the ongoing twists and turns. <br /> Jack Bauer is a federal agent who receives the protection of Senator David Palmer. . He can not trust anyone because CTU people may be involved. And when those events occurred her daughter: Kimberly escapes from home for a party. But ... <br /> <br /> At the end of the episode, you want to watch over and over and over. <br /> <br /> It is only the first of the lot and it is excellent.
