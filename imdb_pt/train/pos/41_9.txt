"Who made this?" contains many laughs and gags. It's not just one of Stooges's best films with Shemp, it's one of the best short comedies produced by Columbia. Director Bernds originally wrote the script for the Stooges in 1946, but when Curly Howard suffered an end-of-stroke stroke, he was adapted for the comedy team of Columbia's Schilling and Lane (his version was released as "Pardon My Terror") . It was too good for the Stooges to pass, and was finally filmed by the Stooges in late 1947. Old Goodrich calls detectives Ace Shemp, Larry, and Moe for fear he will be murdered. When they arrive at his house, Goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and other henchmen try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and take the niece and the henchmen to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is particularly funny in this movie. His reactions after being given a mickey by Christine McIntyre are excellent; it gives its distinctive sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is notably trying not to laugh! Other funny scenes: the close-up of Moe's mug staring at the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all the cast members involved. Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual characters ever portrayed in a Stooges movie. With his hair twisted, he could almost pass for a Goofy, if he did not dominate everyone! "Who made this?" is a gem among the Stooges films with Shemp. Even Curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.
