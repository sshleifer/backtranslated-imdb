First, I will give my classification for the general series; 7 out of ten stars. I took three to slide downhill this series suffered after John Amos left. Do not get me wrong, there were difficult episodes later, but only after Esther Rolle left for a while and came back. <br /> <br /> In February 1974, a great sit-com (with dramatic touches) debuted on CBS. It was a TV first, a show about an African-American family living in Chicago Projects in the 1970s. Created by Norman Lear as a spin-off of "Maude," he once again hit the right chord with viewers. <br /> <br /> Not since this show have I seen a situation comedy speak directly about the struggles of downtown families. (Well there was Fox's "South Central" in 94 but it was not renewed.) John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the final father figure for this family and acted as any parent should keep his family and his children from following the path of life. <br /> <br /> Esther Rolle was a wonderful, senseless mother figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to the education of her children. . <br /> <br /> Ralph Carter as Michael, a young but very clever boy for his age, but stuck in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character is the same of the founder of the program, Mike Evans, who was Lionel Jefferson in "The Jeffersons". (Mike Evans passed away in December 2006). <br /> <br /> Thelma is a 16 or 17 year old girl and has to deal with the dangers of being a young girl in the streets of the ghetto. Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical jovial young man, a jovial type of young man who does not take life seriously. <br /> <br /> Put simply, all my favorite episodes are with John Amos, with the exception of Penny. Gordon / Janet Jackson story lines. <br /> <br /> After the death of the character of James Evans, the show lost its stability and the spectators left. Esther Rolle left for a full year, not wanting to play second violin in JJ's "Dyno-mite's"! <br /> <br /> She returned next season after having assured that the writer would sort things out. Florida neighbor Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who eventually adopted an abused girl, Penny Gordon (played by Janet Jackson, then 10 years old). Penny's abusive mother was played by Totie Fields, the mother of Kim Fields. <br /> <br /> In August of 1979 the program came to an end, with everyone leaving the projects for a better life. JJ, the artist, had sold an idea to a comic book company, Michael went to live on the college campus. <br /> <br /> Wilona & Penny, Thelma and the husband of soccer player Keith + Florida moved into the same building in Chicago. It's not the most realistic ending, but back then it did not matter.
