This film is fantastic because it explores stories and fantasy in the same way as a child, for adults. The idea of ​​a child's drawings becoming a place she can visit and influence physically is wonderful. At the same time, you can call the whole child psychologist and say that she is really exploring your subconscious, just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The part that gives me shivers is when the father is in the paper house and chases after her. The only thing I can not stand is that it was marketed as a horror movie ... it really is not. If you want to see something British with a lot of plot that keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills that most movies have to use, then watch Paperhouse.
