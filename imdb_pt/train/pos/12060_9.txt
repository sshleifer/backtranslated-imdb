I really miss the production of good old-fashioned Spooky movies. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory had the task of producing such a film, it might have been this, save for the lack of an internationally known cast of top drawers. This is one of those movies you watch alone on a dark night with a pizza and some popcorn, and you do not even bother doing the dishes until the morning because you want to hide under the covers. Bravo to director Herbert Wise, writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, Jon Bunker's production design top, John Ralph's art direction, and an excellent cast to make me shudder and feel so isolated even though I'm living in one of the cities most populous in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave a "9" of "10" because with the television production and budget constraints, they really made a great show.
