Wow, I loved this movie! It's about normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It's about things that everyone finds in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and "what the neighbors think" more important than following their hearts. Do not let anyone's opinion keep you from realizing your dreams and your passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could have been my family. No great beauties, but all the people you fall in love with during the movie.
