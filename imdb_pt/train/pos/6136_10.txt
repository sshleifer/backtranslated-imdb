I love so many doorknobs and broomsticks that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time I have the magnificent pleasure of seeing them. I would also like to reiterate the simple fact that I love it so much. I have 27 video copies and I love them all equally. I love someone I love too. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene on portobello road. I learned the dance moves and practice them every day. I have some audio recordings of mine singing the song. if anyone can play drums or guitar, I'm thinking of forming a bed knob and a band of brooms. I hope to call it "the buttons". love me (liz)
