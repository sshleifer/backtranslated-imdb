This movie is unbelievably beautiful. The art of Goldsworthy really benefits from the medium of the film because you can see the art in its most beautiful, moving, changing and flourishing form. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. I can not think of anything else to say about it. It's just the kind of movie you MUST see because it's so visually appealing and it made me very refreshed when I left the theater.
