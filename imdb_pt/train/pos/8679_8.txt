If you are a fan, you will probably like this. If you do not know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema are, this is not the movie to start with. It's very cute, silly, the girls are hot and it's fun to watch. There is no sex until the end of the 45-minute film, but the score is extravagant and the plot is not totally boring. Misty Mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids, so she's not as hot on this as she has been on others. But her panties are really cute (you just have to watch the movie so it does not look too weird). If you like this, you'll probably like "That 70's Girl," "Vampire Vixens," or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a little more sexually graphic). If you'd rather watch Misty or Emerald in less sexy, horror-based (but lower-budget) movies, check out Factory 2000.
