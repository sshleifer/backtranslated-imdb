I like movies that do not provide the typical "happy ending," and that's my main reason for liking this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are being held in Thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip telephoned anonymously to Thai authorities. The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing whether (or which) the girls were involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as his despicable lawyer. Jacqueline Kim does a great job as his kindest and most generous wife, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I wish the girls had been abused more in prison, as another commentator suggested, as I have heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal. Where this film grabs me, however, is its end. Alice undergoes a 96-year sentence in total, so that Darlene can be forgiven, and we (the viewers) realize that both are innocent. Any movie that defies my expectation of the end wins extra points with me, and this well-played drama is certainly deserving.
