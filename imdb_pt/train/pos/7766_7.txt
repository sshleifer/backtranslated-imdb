After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN ON THE WIND, Dorothy Malone finally said goodbye to her sweet sister and wife roles and demonstrated the ability to play tricks with the best. She and Gloria Grahame played the same type of homeless - and for their efforts here in a very manipulative role, Malone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> The film that she is in the movie does not conform to Oscar standards. , but it is a melodrama strong enough under the capable hands of Douglas Sirk. There is an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and sets the tone for the rest of the fireworks with foam in a story that has ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as headliners. <br /> <br /> Domestic quarrels between the inhabitants of a wealthy family with a history of oil are the main focus of the drama, with the emphasis on strong supporting players, Stack and Malone. Both took the opportunity with both hands and Stack should also have been rewarded for his fine work as the weak alcoholic brother, driven to despair by his own wild motives. Nominee stars have less impressive work to do but do it with their usual skill and conviction - Hudson and Bacall. They play their nicer roles with silent authority and understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of color is particularly impressive (as is often the case in a Sirk film) and yet it does not stop me from thinking about the film. as a technicolor film noir in the vein of LEAVE HER FOR THE SKY. <br /> <br /> Worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast.
