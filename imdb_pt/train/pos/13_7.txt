The quality of production, the cast, the premise, the authentic New England location (Waterbury, CT?) And John Williams' lush score should have resulted in a 3 to 4 star collector's item. Unfortunately, all we got was a passable 2 star "decent" movie, mostly memorable for what we tried to do ......... bring an art house style mainstream movie. The location of the small town and the history of the common people is a genre for itself and, if well done, will satisfy most adults. Jane Fonda was unable to hide her intelligence enough to make her character believable. I wondered why she was not doing a postdoctoral fellowship at Yale, instead of working on a dead-end job at Waterbury. Robert DiNiro's character was a bit fabricated. An illiterate, cool and loser guy who ends up being, with a little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. <br /> <br /> This genre was best treated by "Nobody's Fool" in the mid-90s and this year (2003) "About Schmidt". I would like mainstream studios to try more teen stuff and book some screens in the multi-movie complexes for these efforts. <br /> <br /> I'll give an "A" for the effort.
