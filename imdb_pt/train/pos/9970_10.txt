Brilliant use of exaggerated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of today's Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa and Peter sum up society's behavior by peering through a telescope) is unique (and of course Jean-Luc Godard, though subtle, stole this theme in his film "Pierrot le-fou"). Highly recommended!
