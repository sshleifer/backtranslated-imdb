This video is so entertaining, makes the rest of Eddie Murphy look very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just shows how good it is). To be honest, I do not think I've laughed at anything as much as that, including Naked Gun and Bargear rarely seen. This show is incredible, although it should be said that it is certainly filled with the word that begins with F which is four letters (plus its extended version starting with M), but this does not bother me. See, the funniest thing I've ever seen and probably the funniest thing you've ever seen too.
