This is an excellent musical with a timeless score from one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere that gives the film a lot of charm, but in terms of a story ... well, it's not really there. Or at least, not very well worked. The acting is not so smooth either by Caron. But I liked some of the dialogues, I liked the scene on the Seine, I liked the character played by Levant, the colors; and dance, of course, which is quite magnificent. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 seems on point for me.
