All right, I have to admit I've never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Even though I know nothing about this duo of comedic talent, I still really enjoyed this movie. Mary goes back to work. Rose tries the luck of being a comedian. Rhoda fights with a photography career. And Meredith ... what exactly does she do again? These three stories that we follow over two hours are fun and fun in their own way. When the two longtime friends get together, this just makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at how good the writing was. The little jokes Mary and Rhoda made were funny. The script itself was very well done. <br /> <br /> I had seen Moore and Harper in other films in the last few years and I thought they were very good. But I had no idea they worked as well as a team. While both actresses do their part to fulfill the title of this film, they never disappoint me. (During the running of this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles well, but no good. The rest of the cast as Jonah, Cecile and .... everyone also works well together. <br /> <br /> Since this is a meeting, you'd expect a fan of both shows to enjoy it. Of a non-fan I still liked this little date. Good story lines for each character and the two main characters is what makes this movie very good. (The latest version of the MTM theme song also does not hurt.)
