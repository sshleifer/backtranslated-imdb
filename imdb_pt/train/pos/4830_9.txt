Although some criticisms are clearly heated by Luke, I find the story totally captivating and even though some critics have described the love story as "Mills and Boon," so what? It's good to see a warm and touching story of true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously wiping their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are in love with each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I felt that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, might also be played as a pantomime villain. As there are rumors that he was indeed Victoria's true father (as a result of an affair with his mother, the Duchess of Kent), it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young princess, stuck in the sweltering palace with courtiers and politicians to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great queen of England who thrived like never before under her long reign. I believe that word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful film.
