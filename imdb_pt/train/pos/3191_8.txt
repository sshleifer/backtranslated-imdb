Director Edward Sedgwick, a veteran of the visual comedy, successfully leads Hal Roach's road show, which offers a fast-paced, skilful, and excellent cast scene, employing a large number of trusted Roach artists. Although the film was originally planned as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, Jack Haley is Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his car repair business and travels to Hollywood where he tries to show a screen role for the girl he loves . Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers to use the entire MGM studio as her set, does so here, because Cecilia, always ready for an audition, is treated by an aspiring lover, movie star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), backstage . of course, a musical comedy, featuring the Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy offer several nice interludes, including their famous skit involving a tiny harmonic, and we witnessed great twists like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks, and Walter Long. In short, one must hand over the bays to Mischa Auer, who clearly steals the image as an emotional film star, a role he largely creates, and the director for his clever homage to Busby Berkeley's film shows.
