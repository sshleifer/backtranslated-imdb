Based on the preview I had seen, I went to the "shower" expecting a small sweet comedy; what I found was a deeply touching drama of family life told in some of the most exuberant photographic images I have ever had the privilege of seeing. In addition, later reflections have made me appreciate the abrupt cuts in scenes from the past (in the arid interior of northern China and in the high plains of Tibet): is not this how memory usually works? One moment I'm here, the next I'm in a past landscape, anyway ... <br /> <br /> I not only strongly recommend this film, I would put between the two or three of the best movies I saw in my 60 years. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, a few years ago, another Asian "comedy" was released in the United States as "Shall We Dance?" (Japanese). As in "Shower," the preview gave no indication of the depth of that movie, which turned out to be a subtle psychological study (though full of funny moments). Is there a fear by distributors of making movies look "important" or "deep" to appeal to US viewers?
