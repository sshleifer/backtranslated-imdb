Not for people without a quick mind or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you do not have any of these You can not understand. And if you do not understand, you will not be able to take advantage of it. :) For example, if you think Picasso is the name of a car produced by CitroÃ«n, probably if you see a painting by Picasso, you will simply go through it, deciding that it is a worthless job of some street painter. :) So do not judge, before trying to understand it :) In the end, I think it's a must for all with open minds. Yet my N1 remains the redemption of Shawshank! And remember that not all things can be put into pictures. Because there are things in this world, that any frame simply will not fit.
