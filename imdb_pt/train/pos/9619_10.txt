Ok, so a 10 for a 2 1/2 stars movie you ask? ... well see this and maybe make more sense .. Hitchcock has never mixed scenes better together .... The film weaves scenes together perfectly from the beginning and yet you can not feel that scattered feeling that sometimes happens when a movie shows him the many characters he tries to develop. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they will not disappoint you when they do. Surrealist tale of screenwriter / producer Phil Hay, mixed with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie with the same title ... I'll be looking for more good things from that producer in the future.
