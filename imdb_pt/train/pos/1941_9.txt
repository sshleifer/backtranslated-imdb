I really thought this is a comedy and sat watching waiting for laughing my butt. it soon became clear that this is not comedy, or at least not a "Jim Carrey" type. What we continued to watch were the characters - the movie begins with some rather gloomy and disturbed people gathered to try to counter one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. We begin to enter their lives little by little, witness their problems, guess their thoughts. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've made it appear much darker than it really is, and beyond the chain of events, it soon brings some light and hope into your lives. <br /> <br /> I probably would not have watched the movie if I knew it was not a comedy but a drama, but I had fun, I enjoyed the story and I do not mind spending about 90 minutes with it. <br /> <br /> Many movies deal with alienation among people in the Western world, this film shows how people can come together and help one another. <br /> <br /> "If in the light of day death, you find her, do not let her pass you by and walk away, do not lose her, she's your gift from the sun ... "<br /> 9/10 <br /> Peace and love
