The movie "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a brilliant jewel in the debris of films produced by Disney Studios recently. Parents who have had to go through "The Jungle Book 2" or even a Pok√©mon movie will surely enjoy this. <br /> <br /> The film is one of the few who try an original story; previous films were merely re-reports of existing stories. Movies like "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters SA" all do the same, but it should be noted that all were made by Pixar and only distributed by Disney. Recent films from Disney Studios are released directly to the video, and are sequences of an existing hit movie. The quality of these films is given to profitability. A new era started with "Atlantis" was "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch" and more recently "Open Range". The writers have created all the original lines of the story, instead of the fairy tales of the past. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is dedicated to the quest for Atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many. hundreds of years. Including the young Milo Thatch, voiced by Michael J. Fox. Milo is employed by a museum in Washington D.C .. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who dedicated his life to the discovery of Atlantis. This was seen as a waste by his colleagues and they wish Milo did not follow in his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum board to sponsor her expedition, Milo arrives home to find a woman in her dark apartment. She takes it to her employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was close friend of Milo's grandfather and wishes to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very wealthy and paid for the best of everything. The crew that must accompany you is the same as your grandparents. The journey is full of great obstacles to overcome and is very fun to watch. The spectator is trapped if they reach Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, not just the discovery of people. It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience. <br /> <br /> The animators did a wonderful job at the depth of the animation. The film is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images. A feat that is not easily achieved, most audiences are quick to note the difference between the two. The characters are incredibly human. There are some cool chase scenes with lots of action going on. Some lulls are full of jokes that kids may not understand. <br /> <br /> The creativity of writers really shines. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including an entire language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Credible, if by a younger audience, this magic really exists. The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magical, but can best be described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although set in 1914, the level of technology used is unrealistic. The trip is in a submarine very reminiscent of Captain Nemo's Nautilus, complete with sub pods that shoot torpedoes. The giant excavators are driven by steam boilers, so they tried some vintage technology. The female characters are empowered in a way that women of the time would not have, even holding leadership positions. This is not a bad thing. It gives a good role model to my daughter instead of a male cast. <br /> <br /> One reason why this movie is one of my favorites about other Disney movies is that there is not a single song, ever. A tradition that began with the first feature film, "Snow White," and continued through "The Lion King," almost every Disney movie is filled with animated music. That's great and all, what would the Seven Dwarfs be without "Hi HO!"? After the millionth time, it would be almost better without, but this saves the father. Not once does everyone on the screen suddenly know the words of a song that no one has ever heard before and begins to sing. I, at least, am grateful. <br /> <br /> The plot and depth of the animation will surely keep the attention of the parents and the child. It's a movie that I'm willing to watch again and again with my kids.
