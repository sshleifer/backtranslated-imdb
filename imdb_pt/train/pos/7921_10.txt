It's funny, watch it !!! <br /> <br /> OK, they want 10 lines there: This is a parody of werewolf movies from the 50s / 70s. A lot of satire, some policies. It looks like a Clouseau movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with less slap in the slap. If you like the Naked Guns movies, you'll also enjoy this (again less slapstick in this movie). <br /> <br /> In fact, humor ranges from mild sexual innuendoes (inevitable in a teenage comedy) to a really poignant sociopolitical satire. The transformation from the Secondary School of the Moon from the 50s to the 70s is really funny. The sequence with the changes in the presidential portraits is brilliant! OK maybe it's not brilliant but still hilarious. There are tons of (hysterical) cracks from the cold war paranoia of the 1950s and the inflation of the late 70's. <br /> <br /> Either way, just watch the movie if you have a chance!
