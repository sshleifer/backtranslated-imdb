FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!! I've been waiting for this movie to come out for almost a year, and I finally saw it on the SB premiere. I met some of the actors who were really cool and who were great in the movie. I watched the trailer so many times that I did not know what to expect, but I was totally sucked. The film was really beautiful to see and the music was good too. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Ryan Donowho, and Dominique Swain was also good at it. the other actors were good too. I hope it comes out on DVD soon !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first came into ryan watching the OC and then saw him in a lot of good indies as Imaginary Heroes. He's great in this movie, and all he does is indie. I like Dominique too, but I have not seen her that much. I hope to see you both sooner !!!
