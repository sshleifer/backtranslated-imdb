Like most people, I've seen Jason Priestley on TV and I think he's great. But I did not know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" as the other woman despised. Good music, intrigue and a death scene involving Amanda's revenge for an abusive Dr. who will be with you for weeks. I'll leave it like this. Kudos
