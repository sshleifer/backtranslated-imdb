I loved this episode. It's so big that all 5 get together and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are the protagonists! I just hope Clark joins the Justice League and we're going to follow this group of heroes around the world! =) It was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as a Watchtower, that would be such a cool thing for her to do beyond the Daily Planet because she does not have super powers. Also, I want to find out what kinds of subjects Lex will use for 33.1, I'd like to know what other types of powers other people in the world have !!!
