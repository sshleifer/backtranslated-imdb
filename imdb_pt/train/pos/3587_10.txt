I really like this movie ... when I started watching it, I thought I would get bored very soon, but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great movie and I've seen it a few times now. The characters are believable and I have to say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green again (the first time in Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if you were a fan of it, but I agree with another comment made previously, that the ending is kind of disappointing. I would love it to be a little different! No matter, though, good exciting story.
