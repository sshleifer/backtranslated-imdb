This hectic western turns the story of the famous rifle from the early west, coveted by everyone. James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the winning Winchester in a shootout, only to lose him in a robbery. The story details Stewart's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film. The rifle changes hands every time, as if the owner was doomed to lose him by violence. The image has a lot of action and suspense as Stewart closes on his prey. A great cast supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems mischievous here and the purpose of his role is rather obscure. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, lovers of adolescence in recent years, have short but good roles.
