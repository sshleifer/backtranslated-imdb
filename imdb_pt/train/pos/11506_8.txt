"Kolchak" was a TV series that really did not fit into any category. Part horror, part comedy, some social conscience played, and what we have is something that I think people were not ready for. It's a shame, actually, when I first started watching those programs on the Chiller network, (I never saw the originals), I realized just how different and interesting it really was. Starring Darren McGavin as Kolchak, a reporter for the International News Service, and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss, Tony Vincenzo, the show followed the feats of a Chicago reporter who, most of the time , became a part of the story itself as he searched the windy city for modern creepies that happen at night. The underlying charm of Macgavin really sets the show apart. A rather silly guy, who always wears the same suit, you can not help but love him. His jokes are great, and the comings and goings between him and the skeptical publisher, Oakland, are frankly hilarious. <br /> <br /> Stories are mostly very good, and the acting is very good. The '70s were not a great period for special effects, and the show suffers from it, but if you suspend disbelief, what you have is a fun series that was ahead of your time.
