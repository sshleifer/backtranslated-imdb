This group of English professionals is a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast could form a series of its own. It is seen before the love between the head of surgery, his wife and a new resident of beautiful boy surgery. Only the superior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and sexy Robson Greene elevate it from the junk category to a very enjoyable "joke". The only complaint is that it is difficult to accept the latent Francesca Annis falling in love with Michael Kitchen, who, like me, is hardly an international or even British sex symbol. You can easily understand why Robson Green would ignite his fire, with excuses for the "Doors". The guy who almost steals the show with a great "laid back" performance is Owen's father, David Bradley. See it in "The Way We Live Now", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of ​​its scope. Daniela Nardini, as Kitchen's secretary, at some point in sex, it's hard to forget how the despised lover who makes Kitchen sorry, he already looked at his big body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as friends of Green's surgery, as I said, could have their own series. They are so good. The whole thing is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it, and thanks imdbman for letting paying customers have their opinion on this fascinating site.
