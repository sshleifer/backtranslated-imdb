I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football. This was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad he won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and Archie Punjabi as well. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play football, but her parents want her to learn how to cook and want to get married. When Jazz begins playing secretly for a football team, she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers), who is her coach. When her parents discover problems, but her father lets her make the big wedding game of her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi). In the end, her parents realize how much she loves football and lets her go abroad to play.
