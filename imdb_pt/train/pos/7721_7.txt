A flying saucer (literally) manned by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from Earth to check in a colony founded 25 years ago on a "forbidden planet." What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on Earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization in which he plunged. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this story is a murder mystery of science fiction. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but that is an exaggeration and, in a way, an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped of what makes it a science fiction movie, it sure is The Storm, but how many hundreds of movies can you say something like? <br /> <br /> Below, this is a cautionary tale about the progress and technology and social evolution necessary for its proper and safe use. However, the film still continues with all hope for our future that we have come to expect from shows like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this movie is best described as beautiful. The special effects, and even the aesthetics of the scenarios, are powerful enough to make uninspired direction and uneven performance almost imperceptible. If it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of the science fiction films of the 1950s, you might think you were watching a 60s piece. <br /> <br /> This is a classic of that very special subgenre . I like to call sci-fi the 1950's, and while not, in my opinion, the best is certainly a must see for anyone interested in science fiction movies and special effects. The clever plot, now rendered banal by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and even Farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most science fiction fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film that seem to have inspired themes from the original Star Trek series shown about 12 years later, although they may be disappointed by the sexism of the 1950s (relatively light) and the lack of any kind of movie. racial integration. Although I do not intend to criticize, the lack of social progress manifested in this film was the biggest problem I had with him. <br /> <br /> Some will probably see this movie simply to see the beautiful young Leslie Nielsen in one of her earliest leading roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only medium and sometimes bad (especially at the climax of the film). Walter Pigeon, though excellent in other films, overcomes his role as well. Francis, Earl Holliman and the incredible Robby, the Robot, are the actors who stand out in this crowd, although, in general, the actors who are part of the group do a good job. The problems with the featured performances, I think, are as much the director's and the publisher's fault as anything. Although they certainly have hit most of the film.
