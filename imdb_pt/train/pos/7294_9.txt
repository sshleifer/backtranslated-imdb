After reading several reviews, I felt I had to add my two cents too. "Sorrow Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I've ever seen. I had the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for a short time. The story is focused on a young woman who is the victim of her abusive father. She is soon given the choice to "stop it" by a demon played by "Eric Etebari of Witchblade". Having watched the show, I was incredibly impressed by how he played this unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The performance was absolutely superb by him. The girl was fine and her father was decent. There is also death in this that follows the girl until she is able to escape her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely stunning. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budgets for this. It is rare for you to see such a short quality. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable to any great movie. That's not to say it's not without its flaws - I thought it took a while to get started and the introduction was a bit long. But that stayed in my head days after watching it. There are very few short films with this level of quality.
