Well, the story is a little hard to keep up with the first time, but that's only because of all the 70-year-old bare-belly painted vampires / witches dancing to the bongos. This, of course, interrupted by some vampiric orgies. And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them. And for girl in action girl, vampiric or not ... this movie only rocks !!!
