THE MATADOR (2005) *** Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a middle-aged crisis while in Mexico, where he befriends a friendly American businessman (mostly affable Kinnear) and discovers that there is more life than death. Rookie Richard Shepard makes a solid film debut with a comedy of dark humor with a keen eye for visual detail and dialogues with nuances and character development that make him a talent to watch in this gasping mood in the comedy of friends Formula trespassando que se se anticipates his clues and allowing Brosnan to yank his ya-yas with devilish joy. An indie sleeper gem hit.
