Actually this movie was not so bad. Contains action, comedy and emotion. There are good actors in this film, for example, Doug Hutchison (Percy from "The Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy, of "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was very good and also funny, but what surprised me most was David Morse as Edgar Clenteen. He plays a character different from usual, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" he plays a very nice person, and in "Bait" the pieces almost the opposite , a man without emotions, which was good to see. The only really negative thing about this movie is the various photos of the World Trade Center, which makes this movie look a bit dated. Overall I thought this was a great movie!
