<br /> <br /> I have problem with the other reviewer's comments for the simple reason that this is a MYSTERY FILM, not a supernatural! It's not the only film that has an apparently "supernatural" explanation ("vampires"), but turns out to be a very mundane movie. Other films that come to mind are "Before Dawn" by Edgar Wallace. "and the (most famous)" Mark of the Vampire ". The film does a WONDERFUL job by creating a very" scary "atmosphere, similar DRACULA, when Renfield meets the Earl on the staircase of his castle , or MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, when the two people look through the windows of the castle ruins and see a "corpse" touching an organ, while Luna descends using wings! VERY surreal! <br /> <br /> If one likes of these (often silent) atmospheric touches, THIS MOVIE IS A MUST! Norm Vogel
