Starfucker (which says Starstruck in my box) was the most incredible movie I've ever seen. I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look on a darker side of Hollywood. I forced some others to watch the movie and everyone agreed it was an excellent movie.
