This movie was a disaster at the box office, and the reason behind it is the film's innocence, sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story is very simple and old, but the presentation of such a story is very good, the Director tried his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role, he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. Rest star cast was simply as well. Music and all the songs are good, Himesh is amazing as a singer here. Do not miss this movie, it's a wonderful movie and good for us. Abhay best work to date. I'll give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.
