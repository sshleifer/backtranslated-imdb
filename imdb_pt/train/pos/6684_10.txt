This is a great movie. I love more every time I watch. Most comedies can get very boring because you know all the jokes, but mysterious men have so much integrity in writing and characterization that they watch one more time - as Ben Stiller rips the hood ornament from the limo, or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser , or Geoffrey Rush shows off his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits grunts as he watches the news, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens - it's a pleasure. This is the perfect pitch set of acting. The story unfolds directly and consistently, the sequences of action are creative and not very dominant, all arrangements are rewarded until the end. Seriously, if you've seen it in a while, watch it again, and if you have not already, start it. You can not watch again until you've seen it for the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the test scene, very good stuff!)
