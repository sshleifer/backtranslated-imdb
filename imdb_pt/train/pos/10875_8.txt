Australia's first horror film hits the screen with a bang. And a stab. And a slice. And a scream or two. And a lot of blood, frustrations, red jokes and a lot of laughs. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many first ones around Cut - it's Dave Warner's first screenplay to be produced, though he has several others chosen. or under negotiation; is the first great film by the director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; and is also the first film by producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a bunch of guys who plunge their feet into this genre for the first time, they certainly know their stuff. cut tells the story of a bunch of Australian film students who hear about a horror movie, Hot Blooded, this was never done because its director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was killed by the actor who plays the psychopathic killer in the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite his lecturer (who was assistant director the night Hilary died,) warning that whenever someone tries to start production of Hot Blooded again someone dies, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants) decide to go ahead and complete the film. They set up a team and got the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), back to Australia - actually, to the original location - to complete Hot Blooded? 14 years after the shooting was turned off. <br /> <br /> Of course, being a horror movie, do many bloodshed happen? long with lots of laughs, some good scares and an Australian soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can make a good mass-market horror film as well as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's a well-crafted feature with excellent special effects, a firm plot and a killer - Scarman - which is a welcome addition to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
