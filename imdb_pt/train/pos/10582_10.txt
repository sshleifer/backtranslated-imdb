Has singing There's drama. Has comedy. There's a story. It's one of the biggest movies ever made ... period. If you can not enjoy this movie then you must be sleeping or in some kind of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy," James Cagney sings and dances at an Oscar; but in this movie he's BETTER! This is James Cagney at his best and most sensational! He's fast with one-liners! He's fast on his feet! It is an uninterrupted action. And the skits of music and dance are classic, especially "Shanghai Lil". And the support cast is great; and the whole movie is upbeat, fast and exudes confidence. And even though this movie was made more than 70 years ago, it's still watchable, to this day. And of course, this movie features Miss. Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She's the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Powell too! If you like animated movies, fast, with lots of singing and dancing, this is the movie to watch.
