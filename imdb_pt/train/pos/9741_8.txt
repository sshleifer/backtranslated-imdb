I was pleasantly surprised to discover that How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was nowhere near as coarse a comedy as the trailer had led me to expect. I quickly absorbed myself in the unfolding of the narrative and remained absorbed everywhere. The rhythm of humorous visual content was, I thought, visible. (I mean, I had the impression that I was witnessing Pegg's attempts at restoring lost control very much "in real time," so to speak.) At other times there was time to share the reflection of the main protagonists (ie Pegg and Dunst) about how events affected them and what had brought them to where they now stood. All the characters were well released, to some extent interesting in themselves and, in general, quite pleasant. (Any apparent ruthless ambition tended to be tempered by a resilience of correspondingly good nature.) A fun, cleverly scripted, brilliantly directed, and superbly played film that I would thoroughly recommend.
