Probably the best picture that Producers Releasing Corp has ever produced, this little piece of horror draws attention from start to finish. Director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one, and more importantly, he knows how to realize his full potential for shock on the screen. It's not just the enveloping plot and the fascinatingly drawn characters, but the setting is absolutely out of this world! Almost all the action happens at night or in the midst of a penetrating and penetrating mist. This chilling atmosphere is heightened by Wisbar's creative direction and the totally convincing performances he has drawn from all his players. The lovely Rosemary La Planche makes an ideal, beautiful, witty and vulnerable heroine. Robert Barrat presents his normal, straightforward portrait of the local big-shot, although it is hard to believe that the nice, handsome guy who plays his son is none other than the late writer / director Blake.
