What a moving movie I have a dear friend who is in her sixties and in the last 15 years has told me that people do not see her anymore, and she longs for fellowship. Being at the end of my 40's, I'm beginning to see what she's claimed. You are no longer young, handsome or palpable. When it says "... this piece of a body ..." wow. How our bodies change and how they tell us it is not prettier. I love it when she starts to change what she wears ... the colored scarf ... she's no longer the sloppy wife. <br /> <br /> It's a sad and wonderful photo at the same time. Sad that she may betray the trust of her daughter ... beautiful in that she finds herself through the difficulty of the case, and chooses to move on and finally have her own life. I love the character's daring even to start the love affair. <br /> <br /> Most love the movie because it is finally a photo that shows the intricate nature of relationships, whether they are familiar or not. We see the vulnerability of Paula, but she will have what she wants at all costs ... (when she tells her mother that she will have a baby for Darren, whether she wants it or not, after her mother asks if Darren even wants a child) . The film hits the mark on how relationships can change and yet reveals what has been there all the time, dormant. May stifled her own creativity to raise a family. A family she did not really want, but it was "something you did when you were young." I love the scene when Darren calls her an old pie, and she smiles and says "I've never been called that before." It was really a gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. Well, I just love him. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only is he pleasing to the eye, he is a true talent. What a cool role. He is much more than any 007 that is right and I look forward to seeing him in more functions of this nature. The scene in which he is giving May pleasure and the look he gives her is a kind of wonder that he has so much control over this woman, and also a pleasure to be able to give it to her. He's really enjoying giving her pleasure. A wonderful scene. The contrast is the love scene with Bruce. Bruce is totally absorbed with his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Oh ... I wonder where my Darren is?
