A good tour of Martino, this is a spirited and pleasant giallo, with great performances of good-looking cast and especially the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the jigsaw puzzle of a plot is so complicated and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate. When everything seems solved, we are again led to a series of twists, fun twists, it has to be said. <br /> <br /> Sexy with plenty of blood kills this well-paced movie with London, Athens and Greek. coastal sites. A super final on Aegean rocks rocks the stuff and lots of fun was had by all.
