For the record, I am not affiliated with the production anyway. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan movie with most of the episodes produced to date. More than 7 seasons (this is the last one), they produced about 50 episodes. <br /> <br /> This is no easy task with almost no budget and everyone offers their time and energy. <br /> <br /> By their own admission, the previous seasons do not have as good production qualities as the later ones, but as the effects progress, the green screen work and the action improves. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to "dive". in "so it started from the beginning and watched all the way.HF benefits from story arcs like all the best sci fi and fits well into the Star Trek universe in which it is set.Functions and" relatives "of the original series have been brought to the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories, sometimes improving the characters over the original. <br /> <br /> The entire experience includes an excellent web site, spools of errors, a high adherence forum that is frequented by many of the actors and production team and a weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for high definition, high budget productions, this is probably not for you. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for continuous adventures in the universe of Star Trek with stories that make the credit of Star Trek and make you think, this is the only one.
