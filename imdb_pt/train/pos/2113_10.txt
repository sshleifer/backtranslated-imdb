The location of the shop around the corner is precisely indicated at the beginning of the film, Balta Street in Budapest, but could be anywhere. The small number of scenarios reflects an average European design, but can be a store on any corner. The film is not about Budapest or the retail business of leather goods, but about the ups and downs of love, reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> <br /> Alfred Kralik and Klara Novak are sparring partners at work, but their anonymous letters to each other are full of hope, aspiration and romance, and the story unfolds to beautifully unite these two aspects. Hugo Matuschek, the owner of the store, is having problems with his wife, she just a voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret case. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who buys his fur clothes. Mr. Pirovitch's life is centered around his wife and children. Pepi Katona 'plays Santa Claus' for a girl over Christmas. You even feel the calm Flora Katchuck while staying at home with her mother dreams about someone. <br /> <br /> The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama. It moves effortlessly from scene to scene. It is one of those quiet films that I retune looking again and again, simple, but deep. The dialogue reflects the discourse of the character that is not common these days. <br /> <br /> The whole performance is magnificent. Even the minor characters, like the waiter at the cafe and the policeman on the street, are perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play with each other perfectly. He was actually getting in his way as an actor and then gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a great actress and is being appreciated these days. Some of your other movies are worth it. Like Mr. Matuschek, Frank Morgan is incredible. Your moment of truth is very touching. Golden stars for all artists. <br /> <br /> It's a well used phrase that they do not do as they used to do (The vague rewording 'You've Got Mail' was terrible), but in this case, it's true. Director Lubitsch is not in farce, fortunately, but he delivered a classic movie of spirit, charm and warm humanity.
