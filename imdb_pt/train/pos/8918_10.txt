No hidden agenda. Pure Scifi. All the fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and was very scared. I was a child :) <br /> <br /> The original can be enjoyed more when compared to the new one I have seen and forgotten. The original, starring the great movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the best and only version anyone should see. <br /> <br /> The production of the film is dated, but the fx used to make Blob stands out. the test of time. I was convinced that this was happening on its own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
