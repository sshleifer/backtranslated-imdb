Most people can say that if someone spent a Saturday night watching a movie, you should be really bored. In fact, I had just returned home and turned on the TV and there it was, "Paulie." <br /> <br /> I had missed the opening credits so I did not know his name but I saw that he had Cheech Marin in it, so I naturally thought I had tuned in to "Born In East L.A." When I saw him talking to a talking parrot, I was ready to reject this as the kind of movie they show at the end of the night. Glad to say, it was better than that. As you know, if you're not, Paulie is lost and trying to get back to the original owner. It seems like it took years to find her. What should be Paulie's advantage, in fact, is a disadvantage of manners. People are faced with a literate parrot and everything they see is a way to make money or benefit. While the character of Cheech Marin "is" making money from him, he is not bad with him. The dance sequences with the parrots are something that kids will find cute, I found them fun. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who is naive, quickly learns that not all humans are nice people. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man lies to him saying that he will help him find his owner, as long as he helps in his research of animal communication. Paulie is now arrested, but decides to make a man fool in a demonstration to others of Paulie's vocal ability. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film Paulie is telling his story to the facility janitor who ends up freeing him, several other animals and finding the location of Paulie's owner. It's an exciting meeting. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown. This part may bother younger children. Otherwise, it's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart. (END)
