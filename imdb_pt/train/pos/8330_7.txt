What a joke? a very competent film that has so much charm and a taste factor that many romantic comedies lack. Einstein is brilliantly represented by Walter Matthau, while Catherine of Meg Ryan is unforgettable ?? Better than I saw her in those movies next to Tom Hanks? as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a young woman to understand Catherine's fight and feel sympathy for her right away, and as a young girl it's easy to understand what must have gone through Ed's mind (Tim Robbins) in pursuing her true love. There is a universal appeal in these emotions, even if I.Q. keeps everything light, fun and well tied. <br /> <br /> Of course it's not heavy, but if you look, there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spiritualist; his sayings, as something like, "If it's not impossible, then why do it?" suggest that he is a believer in meeting higher goals beyond the immediate reach of someone. In this movie, are there any questions about what an accident really is? for example, if the intervention of Albert and his helpers in the attempt to tear Catherine from James, a shameless and loveless (Stephen Fry, who gives this cardboard character life and you can not help feeling his lack of feeling ) account. How much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see, and that seems to be casual? <br /> <br /> And of course we'd like to think about real life, despite what we often observe from people we know Edwards gets the Catherines and Jameses to learn how to thaw the ice in their veins. How good to know that this could work in the land of innocent (and disturbingly exclusively Caucasian) farmers of the Eisenhower era.
