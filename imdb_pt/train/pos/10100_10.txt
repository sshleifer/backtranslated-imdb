I came across this (Act-I) out of sheer luck and that was over a decade ago. This was not even mentioned on the tape cover label. This surprised me. This intimidated me. That shocked me. I finally forgot and almost a decade later, I happened to think about it again. Then he went and bought the two deeds. They were even better than I had experienced at first. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that while the Tank Police continues to be at war with crime, tanks and heavy artillery, it seems as if they are actually having trouble with criminals. This is never shown or is simply a lie, since they seem to be calming most of the time. If this bit of being in a state of war were really propaganda, it certainly was not shown as such. <br /> <br /> I do not think the original Japanese version could have been as good as the American. version of this. But with regard to history, there certainly have been some adequate explanations lost in the translation, but it may be excused.
