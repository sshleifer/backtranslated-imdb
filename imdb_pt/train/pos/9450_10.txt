As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS, and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman makes a film about the violent side of Man in DELIVERANCE, possibly a definitive horror film of the 70s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox portrays four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip through the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before being imprisoned in what Reynolds calls a "big dead lake." But the local mountain people have a grimly painfully obvious vision of these "city boys" wandering through their forests. And the next day, continuing down the river, Beatty and Voight are approached and sexually assaulted (the infamous sequel to the movie "SQUEAL!") By two vicious mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). So what began as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism. James Dickey has adapted the script from his own bestseller, and the result is a shocking and disturbing shock. Often known for his "SQUEAL!" and "Dueling Banjos" sequences, DELIVERANCE is also a pulse-pounding ordeal, with four superb men superb in their roles, and McKinney and Coward making for two of the scariest villains of all time. A must-see movie for anyone who wants to take a risk.
