I'm so glad I saw this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and this turned out to be a real gem. I loved that the film, a kind of love story, was not about some beautiful young twentysomething; rather, it is a story of some beautiful sixty-odd years, which used to be in their twenties. It's a good story, well written and beautifully performed, with fabulous World War II bands as well. It also has a delightful surprise for Scottish castle lovers. This left me smiling and ready to watch it again, which I did a few more times before handing it over. I strongly recommend.
