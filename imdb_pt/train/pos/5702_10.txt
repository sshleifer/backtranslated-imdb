I did not expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it was not the very legend of pornography. In fact, the entire cast made incredible performances in this very underrated movie. <br /> <br /> As some have mentioned before, look for the set of two albums and watch first the documentary "Wadd"; It will give you a lot of information about the story that will be useful to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people seem unhappy with the video of the LAPD crime scene being included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that could have been included, one of which is that the Holmes murder trial was the first in the United States where such images were used by the prosecution. If you do not want to see it, it is easy to avoid; is clearly identified as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" in the menu!
