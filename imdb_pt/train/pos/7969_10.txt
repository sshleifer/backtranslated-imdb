Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. You know the part where Shadow falls into the pit ... thing, I * cried, considering I was only six, I cried! It takes a lot to make me cry! The dogs and the cat are excellently trained. A good family movie, * not * for non-honeys, completely hardened or animal hater, but who could be soft people like me. <br /> <br /> A good movie overall, 10/10!
