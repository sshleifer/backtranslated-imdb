this film was simply brilliant, casting, location setting, story, direction, everyone really fit the role they played, and you could imagine being there, Robert Redford is an incredible actor and now the same being director, Norman's father came from the same Scottish Island as me, so I loved the fact that there was a real connection to this movie, the witty remarks throughout the film were great, it was simply brilliant, so much so that I bought the movie as soon as it was released for retail and I recommend everyone to watch, and the fly fishing was amazing, really cried in the end was so sad, and you know what they say if you cry in a movie must have been good, and this definitely was, also congratulations to the two boys who played the role of Norman and Paul, they were simply brilliant, children are often left off the list of compliments, I think, because the stars who play them all are such a profile walk to the whole movie, but these kids are amazing and should be praised for what they did, do not you think? the whole story was so beautiful because it was true and it was someone's life after all that was shared with all of us.
