I've seen practically every Cynthia Rothrock movie, and to me that's the funniest. This reminds me of Jackie Chan's early films. Admittedly, Mrs. Rothrock may not be the best actress, but she is very good to see herself as a martial artist and a very cute young woman. This movie, although probably not the best of all his films, was the most fun.
