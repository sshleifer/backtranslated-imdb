As a 90-minute experience, it is not up to the standard "Drive", since the actors clearly learned their craft in "Who Am I?" academy while the action sequences are generally no better than those of Mark Dacascos's superb beat-em-up. However, those who liked 'Drive', (and I found it wonderful!), Will no doubt enjoy this too. You certainly will not return to the beginning and watch it all again, but you will definitely return quickly to some of the action scenes for a long time. It is comforting to see that The Art of Quality Fight Choreography is still being practiced, even if not in Hong Kong, and I would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets, time and respect provided to the likes of Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit for the first half hour and do not get mad at the heinous dialogue, it will be a pleasure. Bosch is magnificent and can really come up with some magnificent stunts, kicks and simple acts of bravery. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to be within 500 miles of a copy, locate it and note this. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, he's less articulate than Coolio in 'China Strike Force', but you'll be impressed with the moves on display and with the pain felt by the stunt team - (I'm sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head , or be forced to head a wooden roof for a car at high speed!?) <br /> <br />
