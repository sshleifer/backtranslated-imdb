This comic-style movie is funny, has very rhythmic action and a great futuristic style for it. Writer Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arnie many lines to describe: "Send me a copy," after signing a contract and stabbing a pen in the back of the lawyers; "What a pain in the neck," after strangling below zero with barbed wire; "He had to separate," after cutting his body between his legs; and finally, when Killian hits a billboard with his own face, Arnie concludes, "Now, this happened." Interestingly, it has some similarities total recall, another sci-fi movie starring Schwarzenegger.
