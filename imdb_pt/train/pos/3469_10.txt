This is one of the few films released about a "what if" kind of situation that made me think. It was amazing to hear them talking to each other and to remember all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them. I really think there is a very good possibility that this happens as the movie suggests, and they really made up with each other. These are good memories for all fans, and asking what really happened between them would be selfish. What an AMAZING movie this was. The comedic aspects of the movie were wonderful. To think that they were together to fix things in such a way is a comforting thought for people who wish to have the chance to clean the air with someone they did not know. Seeing John as such a caring and relaxed character was refreshing to hear all the trash that was spoken about him ...
