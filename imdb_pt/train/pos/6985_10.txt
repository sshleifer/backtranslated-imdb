I have to say that as a BSG fan, I did not know exactly what I would think of that program. I saw this on the big screen at the Arclight cinema tonight (as part of the Paley Center exhibits), and the cast and movie producers talked about it later. Ron Moore said he 'wanted to take a clean break from Battlestar, and do something different, and that yes, they would lose some fans, but hoped they would win others.' <br /> <br /> Even without their conversation, I'm now a fan of the new show, but here's what I found out of the movie. I loved it. It was really good. I think I'm a real science fiction (or 'syfy'). "- I really have to type this?) Geek, because I totally watched this as a series. He has a strong and rich history, and kept my interest. <br /> <br /> It starts with a small group of teenagers The actor who plays "Ben" should have given us yet another glimpse of his intense beliefs. The actress who plays "Zoe" looked a bit attractive, but she was playing a teenager (and I'm sure I will not be the one to think that "Zoe" was a Cylon at first, dangers of being a BSG geek). If they are hoping these are the new Bamber / Helfer / Park, they Eric Stoltz has a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by the tragedy of his family that he jumps at the first chance. to leave his house, he grieves and does not let go. a chilling and engrossing work of conveying his character's astute knowledge of the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene in which he creates a network for the young teenage friend of his daughters, imprisons and releases her. No sign of any 'serial killer' he's played in Gray's Anatomy, a really impressive performance. <br /> <br /> Equally strong, though not so much, is Paula Malcomson as his wife Amanda Greystone. She is as smart, well-written, and beautifully interpreted as Stoltz, and I believe they are a couple and a couple who are together forever and have a strong relationship, something that is rarely seen today. I look forward to seeing what happens to this family, and I hope they give you as much as Roslin at BSG - she's strong and smart and when she attacks your son, you shrink, it's really great. Not to mention her eyes, which could have magical powers, that's how intense they are. The scene in which she plays the government agent - a very short but beautifully played scene - really gives you an idea of ​​her power. <br /> <br /> The other part of the program that did not work 100% for me was the scenes with Esai Morales and his mafia clan. He does a good job in general, but I did not believe in this power of mobs, nor intimidated by his threats. I found myself wishing that the whole story was a little more mysterious and difficult to understand; the way it is presented is almost a tribute to the godfather, they kind of hit the head a little. But over time I can see how this will develop into an interesting kind of Upstairs / downstairs, with the poor minorities (Morales et al.) Versus the rich who rule the planet (Stolz et al). And to be honest, I liked it when he talked to his son about the origin of his name - it was a very well played scene. <br /> <br /> Note to BSG fans, the boy who is playing 'Willy Adama' does not look too much like Olmos, but he is just a kid. Whether or not he will appear more than he was in this movie, who knows? I certainly could not say. But that did not bother me, because it was not as interesting as all the rest happening around him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays Sister Clarice, and she's creepy and weird in every scene she's in. I'm not sure where she's going or who she's going to end up with, but I was very impressed with her acting. In this movie she was kind of on the side, but obviously being prepared to play a very important role later. She was nothing like her character in "Rome," something I always find striking in actors. <br /> <br /> A good surprise - the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, even though it's the same guy doing it. Bear McCreary. It has an amazing and unusual approach that took me by surprise, I would buy this score if I had the chance. <br /> <br /> As for the 'panel discussion' after the show, it was presented by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very clever and articulate, David Eick was cracking wise (much like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was cast, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and did not really answer the questions (but I I always had a thing for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she took Seth Green to task for wrongly saying it was in '24 '), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both dear. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were there too, answering questions about how they did the acting scenes with them at BSG. Overall a very interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I am giving the show to 9 out of 10, and very eager to see everything unfold. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what HOLOBAND was originally made of. I have no idea what that might be, but it fascinates me a lot.
