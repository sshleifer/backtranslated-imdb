"Kalifornia" is a good Hollywood suspense and horror odyssey that tells the story of two couples crossing the country to California to split the price of gas: two losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer (Duchovny and Forbes). Pitt's "nails" his character, which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. A good watch for those in flix psycho-killer.
