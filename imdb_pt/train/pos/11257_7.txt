The erotic cinema of the 70s was meek compared to the triple X of today, which is good. Because there is a good story around nude rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I wish they had some vampire effects that they had in the time period and the sex messed up the story a bit. In addition, some of the accents were difficult to understand in periods of time, but it is worth watching the unedited version, then the edited version, which is called the devil's joke. But if you do not mind many naked women dancing and having sex, then this is not the movie for you. However, I liked it and gave ... 7 STARS.
