Father of Pride was the best new show for television since Family Guy. It was another masterpiece by the talented people at Dreamworks Animation. Like the Simpsons, the show revolves around a nuclear family (of white lions, in this case). It also contains many memorable supporting characters, including Roger the Grouchy Orangutan, Vincent the Italian-American Flamingo, the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, the fake patriots Snout Brothers and the Elephant Chutney. The other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything grandly, making the most mundane activities fun. The combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialogues and controversial issues (drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the show's brilliance. <br /> <br /> Blame for the failure of this show is from NBC. They chose to broadcast the episodes in no particular order (perhaps being influenced by invited stars they could promote) instead of the more logical production order. Several times, the show was deprecated by an extra half hour of such a dreck as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes of that was not enough)! It really is a bad omen for the future of television as art, if an original and daring show like this fails while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. Fortunately, the complete series was released on DVD and in the program. now has an opportunity to win more followers. 10/10
