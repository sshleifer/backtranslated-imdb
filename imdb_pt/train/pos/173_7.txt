In fact, Goldie Hawn is from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I disagree. That's sort of Mr. Smith going for the kind of Washington movie, with a few variations, but the same premise. I recorded this cable movie years ago because I had a big fall for Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is highly unlikely that any waitress will get a major job in government just because she saved the life of a great marksman. It made me laugh and it made me angry at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she was in were so ridiculous that I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD). I was crazy to think that our government would create a common citizen in the way it was created. And the speech she made at the end ... beautiful. Too bad many people do not have the courage so in real life.
