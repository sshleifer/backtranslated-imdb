Can I be so simple and primitive in my evaluations that I simply say "I like"? It's fairly funny in pieces, it has big stars and it's lovely to look at. The songs (there are about two that are repeated) are forgettable, but they get ironic and healthy treatment (like the terribly handsome Mr. Fairbanks exploding in the frenetic Wagnerian version of the tender ballad Miss Grable has just presented); there is not much dancing with all the crinolines of 1861 around Miss Grable, and the comedy may be a little heavy, but the result is still very edifying. The photograph (including actual outdoor photos that are a thrill) is incredible, playing with different shades of lush heavy gold. Miss Grable is a little beyond her prime and the most chubby but still fresh and comfortable side in this continental "olde worlde" comedy. It's practically the line of "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth, and this one tends to be quite displeased by many. So I suppose a lot of people consider "That Lady in Ermine" to be outdated and stuffy. But it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move in a certain folder anyway. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the witty script and everything else this movie has to offer, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany, with German and English soundtrack.
