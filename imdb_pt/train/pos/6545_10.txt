I really liked this movie. Most of the comments were bad, but most critics think a movie should be like a drama of ideas. This movie has a bit of drama, but the rest is just fun and a lot of fun. Forget that Julia Roberts is a beautiful woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young woman and there is more to her than just that. Emma was a lot of fun to watch as Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I believe she will go far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on books, but the story is still good. There's also a good mix of other character actors and supporting actors like Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - uncredited. I'm surprised that Disney has not released this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex, violence and name calling. This is a good family movie that is rare on this day in time. So take your family, watch this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can not wait for the continuation.
