Before I begin, I must point out that I know the publisher of this film. We've never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (those things that came before the bulletin boards), and we talked on the phone, so I have a bias here. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> In some ways, it's ironic how, while the Rat Pack culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s made a comeback in the mid-1990s, this film, from son of one of the original Rat Pack, and that was done in a similar way, was a failure. Not only that, it was a critical failure; I think Peter Rolvers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not do that (he did a mixed review, if I remember correctly). And while I do not think this is the biggest movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of the Rat Pack, or "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, this looks elegant and moves on. On the other hand, the central performances are all good. Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly contained here as the gang boss returning from a sanitarium, and has a fun edge to it. Jeff Goldblum returns to the silent and ironic performances he gave in his pre-blockbuster days, like THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is only forced to vamp in this movie, she does it in a fun way. Of course, it's not a great movie; the dialogue consists mainly of puns, and many of them do not work (like the speech "Zen of Ben"). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrible here. Still, I had fun, and if you like gangster movies, so can you.
