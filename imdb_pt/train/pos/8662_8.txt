I love it. In fact, if I come again (and I plan), I can love. I'll repeat other reviewers saying that this movie really grows on you while you watch. It starts out a bit slowly, but the way it's involved is very natural and has the mood for it. You just like it. <br /> <br /> I really liked the summer atmosphere of the movie and I thought the film was very touching as a whole. The characters have a strong element of realism and the film slowly and gently weaves a spell as you engage in the various interactions between all of them and want to know how that will end up being and which paths the characters will choose to take. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this - there are obscure TV movies that have more comments than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing I'm going to miss I miss the ending that's driving me crazy and I have to watch it again to see it. This is a movie that may not be for everyone but I feel it is strongly underestimated (even some of my purist friends who have seen almost every movie there have not seen it) and does not even seem to have much of a message board , but I enjoyed it a lot and for all those who like family dramas that are warm in the landscape, atmosphere and a languid pace without a rush should probably take a look at it. Especially noteworthy is what happens in South Carolina, for those (like me) who love the South, and movies that happen there, this is a gem. I will add my vote to the regrettably few comments and recommend this little-known movie.
