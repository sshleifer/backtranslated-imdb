This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. So on 11/21/01, I saw the 30th edition of this DVD of the movie. WOW I remembered why I loved this movie. The DVD is so good, it has an extra 30 min that the original did not have. I did not know that when I started watching. The movie has done a lot more since then. The music they cut should have been left. You have not seen this movie until you've seen the full 131 min version. Many people say that music is forgettable. I remember all the songs in the color movie, each song has its own charm and comes together like a hole. I remember when I was younger, I had the song "Eglantine" stuck in my head for days on end. As well as "Briny Sea" (this song was made to marry poppens, but was cut from the movie). Please watch the new untitled 30th birthday movie and vote again for this movie. the 10 that really is.
