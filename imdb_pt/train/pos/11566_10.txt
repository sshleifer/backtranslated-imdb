A FRUSTRY OF YOUTH Short Subject. <br /> <br /> A teenager, ashamed of his fear of dogs, runs away from home. The abandoned spaniel he meets helps change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is a nice little movie, with Shirley Temple stealing all of its scenes as the hero's liveliest sister. The opening gag - dealing with enuresis - is in bad taste, but is quickly forgotten. Highlight: the punches at the climax, which seem strikingly realistic. Often neglected or overlooked today, short one- and two-cylinder subjects were useful to studios as important training camps for new or expanding talent both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamics for creating a short success story was completely different from that of a feature film, something like writing a first-rate tale instead of a novel. Economical to produce in terms of budget and schedule and able to portray a wide range of material, short subjects were the perfect complement to studio films.
