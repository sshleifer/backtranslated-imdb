Oh, those sneaky Italians. It is not the first time they base a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the author of the novel in this case. Of course this is not something typically Italian, but it was done a lot in the early days of the movies, mainly because they often thought they could get away with it. The editors of James M. Cain managed to keep this film out of theaters until 1976, but the film nevertheless became a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as good to watch as the American film of 1946. version, but it's a great movie, though. This, of course, is not at least due to the film, it's a great strong story, which is intriguing and provides the film with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel up close and is therefore mainly the same as other versions of the film in its history, with the difference being established in an Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Let the Italians make a movie about life and the real people in it. These early dramas always have a very realistic feeling and therefore also involve a lot of attention. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power in the end, when the film began to seem a little long and creeping in parts. The film could have ended easily 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I really do not have much more negative to say about this movie. It is simply a very made, based on some equally large and strong source material. An impressive debut in the direction of Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct many other great and memorable Italian dramatic films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
