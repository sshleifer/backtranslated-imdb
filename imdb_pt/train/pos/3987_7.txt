Mother is one of those movies that you know is good, maybe even great, but it's like eating vegetables or doing math lessons for a child - a lot of work and a lot of pain to invest. The story is potentially unpleasant in many ways: the death of a character in the first half hour, the December-May novel, the idea of ​​a man betraying his wife and then betraying his lover with his mother , the collection of weak and rather unpleasant characters in their early thirties, the apparent indifference of adults to the children in their lives. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but it is a setback to a collection of British films (usually made for TV) from the late 1980s - it has a moral severity that never ceases to happen, which produces a throbbing and overwhelming anguish . <br /> <br /> The mother is perfect, but that is part of the problem; If a film dealing with so many delicate issues has some flaws - script inconsistencies, some minor actors - this ends up in nothing, but if this film is so perfect, the experience of watching it is raw and painful. Even the technical qualities - lighting, editing, etc. - make the viewer ache; The London in this movie is bright and open, full of strong and cutting light. <br /> <br /> If you are tough as a nail, or are one of those super-sensitive people who like to torture themselves with sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the mother. Anyone in the middle, give a miss, or be prepared to squirm. And be warned: as hard as the movie is from beginning to end, the worst is yet to come. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to get her makeup on. (for sleeping with her boyfriend), and her daughter calmly says that she thought about it and would like to hit her. The mother agrees to this, both get up and - instead of a well-prepared slap - the daughter tightens the fist and releases the punch of a boxer. Argh !!!
