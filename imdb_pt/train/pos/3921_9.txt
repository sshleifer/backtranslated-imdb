In Carmen, Saura once again seeks to establish a dynamic relationship between reality and fiction, between the real passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance parts of the opera Carmen and the written passions of the fictitious Carmen's story, the famous fatal mixture of free spirit (read disrespect for fidelity) and his ability to drive men mad with desire. Saura used this same fiction / reality vehicle in a previous black-and-white film, Blood Wedding. But as tensions between dancers rehearsing Blood Marriage showed how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed through directing their emotions in their roles in Carmen, the parallel between the petty and libidinal impulses of the dancers of the troop during the rehearsals and the spirit of making the mythical Carmen never comes close to being believable. It remains a gadget and, for that reason, an uncomfortable distraction. One really needs to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to enjoy the comparison. However, it matters little, the melodrama that Saura tries to impose on her Carmen, because the flamenco dance and the guitar music of the rehearsals - which are 95% of the film - from some of the best known flamenco dancers and musicians, the entry price. A flawed film, and a wonder: perfect for drilling into Keats's 'negative capacity', perhaps?
