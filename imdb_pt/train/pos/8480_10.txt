Thanks to the Warner Archive, I can once again see this gigantic variety show that contains everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however, is present.) This movie gives screen time to everyone who was under contract with Warner at the time. If some of the artists seem strange to some, it's because they were great on quiet days, and most of them disappeared with the popularity of talkies. There are some truly remarkable vaudeville era artists as well. You will be very impressed with Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. There is also that French star, Irene Bordoni, who sings a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-track Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", which has been restored to this version. She is truly beautiful and star Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the final "Lady Luck" which lasts almost a quarter of an hour. This is truly an epic from the early-talk era. Any fan of old movies will love this.
