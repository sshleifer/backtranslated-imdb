ABC did more for this show, allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the cast of this show. At first, the show was watchable and predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three children are really a solid professional cast. The hours lesson after John's death in real life hit me. I lost my father at age 17 and could sympathize and understand his pain and agony. ABC should be proud to keep this program and even preserve it as John's final wish. This show has matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances. They should be rewarded with Emmys.
