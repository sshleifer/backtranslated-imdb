The film gave a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is good to see and shows how human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something with which Gandhi has bothered and has repeatedly mentioned his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big complaint is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better represented by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too presumptuous and it seemed that he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is not really all-rounded, but focused only strictly on the film. father and son relationship. The rest is blurred and used only to show the overall movie time and setting. <br /> <br /> General cool movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
