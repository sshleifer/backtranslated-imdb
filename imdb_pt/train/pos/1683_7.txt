I saw this movie as it was the second feature on a disc containing the Video Nasty 'Blood Rites' previously banned. As Blood Rites was totally horrible, I really did not expect much from this movie; but it actually seems like the director of junk Andy Milligan has gotten over this time, since Seeds of Sin is at the top of Blood Rites in style and is high as a more than adequate slice of sexual sexploitation of the sixties. The plot is actually quite similar to the Blood Rite, as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit and, of course; there is an inheritance at stake. The film is shot in black and white, and the appearance reminded me a lot of the garbage classic 'The Curious Dr Humpp'. There is almost no blood on display, and the director seems more interested in focusing on sex, with issues of incest and hatred infiltrating. The acting is typically poor, but most women appear naked at some point and despite the bad reputation, director Andy Milligan seems to have an eye for this sort of thing, since many of the sequences in this movie are really beautiful. The plot is fine, and most of the film is filler; but the music is captivating, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with his own sex scenes, since most are a little erotic. Overall, this is not a great movie; but is likely to appeal to the cult fan, and receives a far greater recommendation than the best known and lowest quality "Blood Rites".
