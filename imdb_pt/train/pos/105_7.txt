I have to start with Ed Furlong on this one. You gotta God bless this kid. $ 5 dollars says the character he plays in this movie is what he really enjoys in real life. He has one or two sentences that made me almost explode because of the subtle humor in the script. You know all the challenges this guy has had over the last few years and it does not even look like Furlong is acting. Maybe that's why his performance was good. The same with Madsen. You keep thinking, "I bet this guy is really like this in real life." Does Madsen still have to act? Just natural. Vosloo obviously moved from the type of molded mummy. I think the biggest surprise for this film was the performance of Jordana Spiro. His reactions are clear in this film. I fought whether she was hot or not, but realized that I would just like to see more of her. <br /> <br /> You're not a big fan of shoot'em out / hostage movies. But what I'm a fan are movies with lots of twists to try to keep you guessing. It's not just common thieves who take over a bank, they kill hostages, and the good guys win the final type of movie. The twists keep coming ... and coming. <br /> <br /> The coffee scenes work best with the handheld cameras to show what it really is like inside. Not overcast a bit. Think like Bourne Ultimatum "light" style in some scenes in the cafe. <br /> <br /> And for those Bo Bice fanatics out there - actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make you think twice. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> As I watched, I wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what they were doing in this small town. It made sense in the end for these people to smuggle things to other countries / states so they could have those accents. But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this movie for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of. And some of them are smoking hot. Moncia Dean? I need to say more.
