Regarded by almost every critic as being the best of Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan's films, I have no argument with that, although there are a few others that I find so amusing. One thing: it's the longest series I've seen at 105 minutes. I only saw six of them but this was more than I am accustomed to and with the end of prolonged action I thought the whole thing was a little too long. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good mix of action, suspense and romance. The only things missing are colorful sound and stereo. The primitive special effects do not bother me, since it was all they had in the 1930s. Among some, this film is best known for one thing: the skin! "Jane" never used anything as simple after this movie as the Hays code was instituted at the time the next Tarzan movie was made. Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possessed. The naked underwater scene, however, was not her - by a long way. The woman underwater did not have a good figure, whoever she was. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action here. By the end, it was not too exaggerated. The final lasted 15 minutes, however, and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch. <br /> <br /> Still, this movie offers everything - except "Boy" (your adopted son) - you'd like to see in a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan making his Tarzan scream a dozen times. With his pair of "lungs", that was no problem.
