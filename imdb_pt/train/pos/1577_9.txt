SPOILERS INDO. It seems that von Trotta was much more comfortable with the balance of personal history versus the history of events than in his earlier film, Versprechen, Das (1995). The direction seemed carefully controlled, and visually I felt that it was very appealing - especially as regards the visual narrative (the blending of the title sequence and the lighting of a new candle in modern times commemorating the deaths of various characters) in the past). <br /> <br /> To clarify two points that many people were confused by: <br /> <br /> First of all, Lena did not sleep with Goebbels. While this may seem implicit, that was not the intention. Von Trotta also told me! (And she is a very nice lady, by the way!) <br /> <br /> Second, the time period of events was in fact historically accurate (actual dates are shown in the memorial close-up) and the prisoners were released as suddenly as in the movie. There is evidence showing that Goebbels was upset that he had done this, and planned to eventually recapture those he had set free. <br /> <br /> Overall, what struck me most was that it was an original story a story was "super-moved." It seems a pity that it took so long (for several reasons) for this movie to hit our screens. <br /> <br /> More of the same please, Margarethe!
