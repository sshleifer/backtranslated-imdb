For those who are not familiar with Jimmy Stewart, this is one of his "minor" movies of later in his career. And while it's not a great movie compared to many of your other photos, it's not bad and it's a decent timer - but not much else. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a witch. in New York and for some inexplicable reason, she decides to cast a spell on poor Jimmy to make him fall in love with her. Over time, the cold and distant Mrs. Novak also begins to fall in love with Stewart - and apparently in the witch's rulebook, this is definitely NO, NO !! <br /> <br /> The movie is strange in its sensibilities about witches. They are neither the sacrifice of the baby nor the all-powerful variety. Most of his magic is quite limited and pointless (like Jack Lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps). And, strangely, all witches seem to be Bohemians who frequent trendy bars where you can meet people wearing berets and listening to bad jazz. Considering what I think of jazz, it must really be a witch in the movie world! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is very romantic and slightly comic, but it's not something I ran to watch. The acting is very good, but the script does not offer enough reward to make this film an exceptional film - in fact, I almost got a movie of 6 - it was very close.
