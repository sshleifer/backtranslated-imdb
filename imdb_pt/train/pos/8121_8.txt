The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; The mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but could also represent any nation in the world. When the war finally arrives, the damage continues for another five years, but until 1966, when Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to the desolation and tolling of humanity is the "wandering disease," a plague that continues for another four years. <br /> <br /> "Things to Come" balances a fatalistic and futuristic worldview, where science extends a hope for a revived civilization. The concept of "Wings Over the World" is a bit corny, although spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unshakable in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, the others will follow. This message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly at the end of Massey's speech. Man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and realization requires a "whole universe or nothing" mentality. <br /> <br /> The images of the automation film and machinery in the second half are reminiscent of the great silent film "Metropolis." While Everytown is rebuilt and transformed in the year 2036, the city's renaissance spectacle produces a resounding chord, as the architecture of modern cities today suggests that the film's sinisterly prophetic vision is coming to fruition. Where the film goes wrong in 67 years, man's first mission is the moon, but in 1936 a 100-year calendar probably looked more legitimate than in 1969. "Things to Come" is one of these rarities in the cinema, an image that makes you think. On which side will you come, the forces to progress in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? It is not a comfortable matter, since both choices offer inherent dangers and unseen results. Those who choose to be spectators run the risk of being dragged by forces beyond their control.
