Younger, delightful film, juggling comedy and detective, novels and theatrical genres as swiftly as Lieutenant Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas) balances his devotion to his girl Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty to the force as a detective. This miscellany may not appeal to all viewers today, but in its day, it had something to offer all family members, and the resolution to the somewhat tired plot of feeling versus duty is original and refreshing, and well worth the wait. "The Incredible Mr. Williams" contains what must be among the most scandalous blind encounters in movie history, and his brilliant comedic feat shines. In a ridiculous way, Melvyn Douglas presents some of the best lines: "I walked down Main Street on a Turkish towel before letting any woman control my life!" And the effervescent Joan Blondell lets her barbs fly with typical ease: "Good pain! You look like my Aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> The resolution of crime here is standard, although a good cast of character actors helps bring the material to life. From today's point of view, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" may be more interesting for his insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct, still more malleable by its seemingly rigid boundaries. Although much of the genre commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, it is sometimes both subtle and penetrating, acting not only in some of the finer details of the film but in the battle of genres that reaches its climax in the final scene .
