This is not a movie for fans of Lynch's usual stuff. On the contrary, it is for those who appreciate a good story, or get tired of the ordinary things with sentimentality and Oprah-ish "This is such a wonderful movie! You should see it!" - semantics (because she's right for the first time!) <br /> <br /> The story unfolds without fail, and we are led on a journey that, I believe, most of us will come to recognize at some point. existentialist and compassionate journey in which we make amends to our past when we approach our inevitable death.Performance is flawless, cinematography in the same way (occasionally brilliant!), and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to understand the details of the story. <br /> <br /> A hot movie, not overly sentimental.
