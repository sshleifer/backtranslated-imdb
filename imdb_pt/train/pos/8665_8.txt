I picked up this title by accident with the Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of pure Euro-trash films. But this film has a good seal of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there. Stupednous is not ... satisfying it! Watching this movie, I could not help but wonder ... how did Sergio Martino not make this movie? This has her signature everywhere and punctuated by Edwedge Fenech (not as well known as she should be, but she got a good appearance at Hostel II). Duplicate crosses and triple crosses underneath and cement this film from start to finish with Lee Van Cleef exuding coolness under pressure from the first second. This guy had to go to Italy to finally reach his potential or the studio system let this guy escape? In addition to Lee's most recognizable films, movie goers should experience this by size and see how Sergio Leone had downloaded his epic scale in Once Upon a Time in America for half the run time (and 1/4 of the budget) is what it would have been. So refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and make it to a matinee couch
