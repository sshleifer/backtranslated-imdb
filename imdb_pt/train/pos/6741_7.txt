The title sequence shows credits written on a rain-soaked sidewalk while people step on it; music is provided by someone whistling "Street Scene" by Alfred Newman. Then we met Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his father was not: a guy on the right side of the law. But he's too cruel for a good guy. After several complaints about the people who assaulted him, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon), the undersized. Foley tells him he's a good man, but he needs to have a straight head and be more like Det. Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden) who just got a promotion. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill in a splendidly viscous performance) has an illegal dice game and is trying to make a sucker out of the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell), who was brought by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She discovers too late that her husband is using her as a decoy, and Paine attacks her when she refuses to play. The gentleman Morrison intervenes, but Paine knocks him down with cold. This seems to be the worst, but then it turns out that the guy is dead; and Paine looks guilty. <br /> <br /> But this will not be the story of Paine. Soon Dixon fell in love with Morgan, but not before losing his temper again and committing a terrible act that he tries to cover up. Morgan's father, a taxi driver (Tom Tully), can get rap for it. It's up to Dixon to try to blame Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger directs a screenplay credited to Ben Hecht and three others in William L. Stuart's novel "Night Cry." This is a solid noir film with excellent performances and all the dark photography and obscure morality we expect from this genre. It holds up to the well-lit end, which looks like something the studio had filmed to appease the censors. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger and starring Andrews and Tierney is "Laura." You'll like this, but you can not miss it.
