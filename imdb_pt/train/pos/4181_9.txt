It's been so long since I've seen this movie (at least 15 years) and yet it haunts me with a vivid picture of the terrible consequences that prisoners of war can face, despite the terms of the Geneva Convention. <br /> <An Australian submarine demolition specialist unit is captured in an archipelago near Japan after a successful mission to establish mines in a Japanese port. <br /> <br /> Once in prison, these men expect the same treatment as any other prisoner of war. but to their astonishment they soon learn from a friendly Japanese jail guard who are being tried as spies since being left without uniform when captured. The consequences of such an infraction, by Japanese martial code, are execution by decapitation. Despite his requests, and the appeals of the penitentiary, the day of judgment approaches like a time bomb. The tension is so high that you will actually hear the ticking, although it may just be your chest beating with the percussion of a running gait squad. <br /> <br /> The ending is really too painful to re-enact in my head much less write here. But I can promise you - you'll never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the USA.
