What can you say when you see a good French film that tries to draw a suspense story according to the social context of the characters? The main point is that we believe in these characters and when they get to know each other, we want them to stay together. It's simple and very efficient. The background story is less important. Why is the script going next to a half-developed thriller? It does not help get stuck in those social statements that most French filmmakers like to do. Not much ambition, right: Sur mes l√®vres is just a fun French film with good characterization. <br /> <br /> For all the smart spots noir in the script, the ending is very easy. This is as easy as in the Rear Window (an obvious reference and definitely not a movie noir), but with a less convincing context. Where I am surprised is to see that the character of the bailiff was not erased. It brings very little to the story; when he appears alone, we wonder if we have not missed a part before. Jacques Audiard is not a newcomer yet. Strange and strange.
