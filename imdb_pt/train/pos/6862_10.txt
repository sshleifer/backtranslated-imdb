When people ask me why I like movies so much, I usually respond, "Have you seen the sequel to the art gallery in De Palma's Dressed to Kill?" This scene alone represents pretty much everything I want to see in a movie. If I were a film director, that would be the kind of thing I'd like to do. "Pure Cinema" is one way of describing this sequence, and it's really amazing to see how the entire film by director De Palma works on the same high artistic frequency of that scene. It's a dream movie, clever as hell, and with more enthusiasm and intelligence than a dozen movies together. I think the film raises an important point that will always be a hotly debated topic: could a film rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success? The movie has no message to speak of, the acting is great, but it's in the service of the style, and the script is short on logic. De Palma's film makes a good case that the style, when handled properly, can sustain a full-length feature film. Of course, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superlative performances, but this is a director's movie all the way to fadeout. It is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. I'm not going to tell you about which Hitchcock movie the film honors (I do not want to spoil any surprises), but I think De Palma transcends the arc of the story, and he manages to create a film that sums up his entire career well. . Not for the faint of heart!
