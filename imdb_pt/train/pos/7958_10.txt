I really liked the movie. In the end I was in tears. This movie is incredible. Watch the movie. you will like it.I could have given the rating more than 10.i liked the teaser between chance and sassy.I like the lead of the shadow.In general this movie was perfect. <br /> <br /> Its sequel is good but it's not good like this movie. I think there should be a third sequel to it. Not only does this movie appeal to kids but also adults. My entire family liked this movie. Chance was full of humor. Sassy is a smart cat. <br /> <br /> Once again I say that this movie is a clock. The more you see this movie the more you are connected with this movie.This movie is a classic.
