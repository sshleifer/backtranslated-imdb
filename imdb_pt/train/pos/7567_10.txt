An excellent film portraying the cross-currents in the lives of a multi-ethnic mix of people not so common in the rural Pacific Northwest. Strong direction and writing, along with good acting, especially the performances of Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Curiously, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful "Crash", written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of action may not be as frenetic as that of urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem more familiar with each other in "Apart From That," but the characters' personal relationships are so flawed and problematic, and their stories as resonating with those of "Crash". For those viewers who appreciated "Crash", this is a must-see movie. In addition, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will enjoy this movie.
