This is one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays a kind of Agatha-Christie murder mystery author who locked her nephew by marriage in a chest. Gordon believes he murdered his niece and the young man dies of suffocation while Gordon is traveling to and from New York. He can, however, leave behind some clues, scratches in some black coffers, and an improvised, well-hidden note. Columbo enters the case, suspects it immediately, and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is in the hand as secretary and presumed blackmailer of Gordon. Hartley is, I believe, the granddaughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner. I'm not sure if her ancestry has anything to do with her attractive navel, which is on display during a belly dance sequence, but I've always admired Skinner anyway. <br /> <br /> Murder is well treated. It's a good plot, and none of the artists or staff fluff anything. But the prominent figure here is Ruth Gordon, just a jump over five feet tall. She was over 80 and looked. There are times when she almost hesitates, but she always exudes charm. His acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure when she is serious or when she is putting Columbus and the public. She gave some good lines too. What humor comes from Gordon. Columbo does not have any of his frequent comedic moments. <br /> <br /> In short, a good job for all involved.
