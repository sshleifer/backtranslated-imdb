Alain Resnais's movies are strange in the way they are not actually edited for continuity, but instead the shot seems to end up exactly where a memory was edited. Love to Death is sometimes a silent existential drama and a realistic magical creative film, and it nonetheless treats audiences with a new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or perhaps creates a new relationship, that of Agape / Thanatos O Beginning is like a bizarre surrealistic horror movie. A woman runs desperately through the house while a man is dying in her bed - did she kill him or what happened? Soon this tension is dissolved when a doctor arrives and pronounces him dead, but from there begins a new drama, stranger: the man wakes up and, after dying, the woman and the man fall in love with really tragic consequences. Meanwhile, his friends, both priests, observe and submit their own debate to the nature of love, faith and devotion. Resnais always seems to have some artifice to make these kinds of narratives work. and what is so surprising in their films is that these devices always work. In this case, Resnais interweaves scenes with snowfalls falling to an exciting orchestra score, which disappears and bleeds into the subsequent shots that continue the story. Stuck on this elegiac side periodically, the film develops a rhythm not unlike an epic poem, and I received strange flashbacks from Dante's Divine Comedy, despite the lack of direct reference within the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but this transcends only the cinepo structure to something that forces a certain degree of introspection on the viewer, which has the possibility of bringing some strange memories to the surface. Narrative of memory, Resnais creates. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
