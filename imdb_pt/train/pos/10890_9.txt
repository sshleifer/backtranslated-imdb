Come on guys. This movie is better than 4. I can see it happening ... rich people have done things crazier than that. And it was funny. <br /> <br /> I watch a comedy to entertain, escape the pressures of the world for a while and not have to take anything too seriously. This movie is totally suitable for this purpose. I judge a movie by its own merits and am not about to compare Surviving Christmas with Blazing Saddles. I watched totally dysfunctional people become caring and friendly individuals who could easily live on the street of my home. It will remain on my list of "favorite ..... must watch for the holiday season". If you just want 90 minutes of fun, watch this one.
