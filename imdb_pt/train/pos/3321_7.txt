I saw "Fever Pitch" by accident; was playing on the plane going to Europe. It was not really bad at all. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the biggest fan of the Red Sox, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) could hurt that. The film is a very interesting insight into how world events can affect people's relationships. It's especially surprising now that the Red Sox finished its 80-loss losing streak a year. I think these kinds of things happen all the time and we just do not tend to notice them. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that portrays an unusual relationship with baseball is "Frequency", 2000. Check both.
