There are few really hilarious science fiction movies, but this one's gonna blow your sox off. The takeoff of Jack Nicholson, the Martian, is divided. The plot has a very smart touch that can be seen to be enjoyed. This is a movie with heart and excellent acting of all. Make some popcorn and have a great night.
