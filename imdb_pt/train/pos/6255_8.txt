This movie shows people in the middle of the two hottest days in Austria. It shows people humiliating other people and being cruel to other people. This shows the inability of people to communicate or talk to others. <br /> <br /> In the session where I participated, people were leaving in the middle, because they could not watch the movie anymore. And rightly so. Because the movie is not easy to watch. It has a very depressing message and there is no moment of pity in the film. It's a very cruel movie, not for everyone's taste. You can not talk about terms of enjoyment of this movie. It catches you in your throat and never loosens and in the end you simply feel out of breath because of its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can not "recommend" or "recommend" this movie. You should make your own opinion based on what I said earlier. Just be aware that this is not a regular movie and is not to everyone's liking.
