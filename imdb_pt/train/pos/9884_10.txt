Rawhide was a wonderful Western TV series. Concentrating on a bunch of trail troopers led by trail boss Gil Favor. Most of the episodes - especially the first 3 seasons, were actually character studies by Favor and his men. The invited stars came and went, but unlike the Wagon Train, they rarely dominated the episodes in which they appeared. Rawhide was a true westerner and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character who would never be forgotten. Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance, the show became a huge success. Of course he was cleverly supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Shay Rocky, Robert Cabal. All these actors have left their mark on a piece of television history. Rawhide captured the flavor of that time of the west that no other series has for me, though in any case, managed to do so. Subsequent seasons tended to split leads and give them individual story lines. For me, sometimes that did not work - the livestock unit and patrons provided the best stories. However, there were still some classic stories and Rawhide remained at the top of the drawer. Black-and-white photography added to a somber, realistic feel that other Western series rarely managed to capture. Rustlers, Indians, Commancheroes, beautiful maidens in danger, serial killers, they all came up to give trouble to our heroes. The final came to the series in silence when the final season was cut to less than half. The reason - Eric Fleming had left and Rawhide was now a head without a body - brave realism was gone, Gil Favor commanded respect and exalted authority - he was never infallible and that made it all the more interesting. We will not see your taste again. Watch an episode whenever you can, they rarely disappoint.
