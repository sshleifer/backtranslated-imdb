10 ITEMS OR LESS is one of those "under the radar" images that are soaked in the simplicity that most independent films have: honest and ad hoc performances by their two protagonists - Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, who establish a complementary duo, though unlikely . . Best of all, this whole movie seems unlikely despite its roots in the road movie. As Morgan Freeman's unnamed character psychically (not physically) comes to the place where he meets this tired checkout girl who has an unhealthy relationship with his current supervisor (who is also getting this with his womanizing husband played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is somehow left to us to witness more than deducing and its witty joke - two people on opposite sides of society's currency - is deceptively simple. So, in a nutshell, while there is no crash! moments of revelations that shake the earth, this movie is a little quirky humor piece that would probably otherwise be lost in the indies mix that came out in 2006, but deserves to be seen, if only for its honesty.
