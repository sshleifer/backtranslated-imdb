Although some may call it "Paradiso de la Cinema Cubano", the film is closer to How Green Was My Valley, a memoir of mourning for a lost innocence. The film avoids falling into the political trap of taking sides (pro-Castro? Anti-Castro?, Focusing on the human frailty of the characters and the importance of the family.) Full of good acting, in particular the Mexican actress Diana Bracho, who plays the wife of Keitel. A masterpiece, replete with references to classic films, from CASABLANCA to CITY LIGHTS from Chaplin.GalleGracciaBernal plays a small role that is critical to the dramatic reward of the story. TV director Georg Stanford Brown on a rare return to act (remember THE ROOKIES?), plays a homeless bum who acts like a Greek choir, superbly. It's a pity that this film, originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA, was released in the US by THINKfilm with the atrocious title of CUBAN BLOOD , which has nothing to do with the film.
