I love this movie. It's a great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist-type issues, like girls who want to practice sports once reserved for men. It shows the struggles of an Indian person wanting to flee their cultural barriers and women who want to escape the gender constraints found in sports, especially in England at the time. I feel that cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the other commentary, I do not think this movie looks like Dirty Dancing or any other girl movie. This movement is loved by many kinds of people, men and women, young and old.
