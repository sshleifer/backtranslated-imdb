This movie is just funny. stupid but funny. to enjoy this movie completely you may not have a perception of what a movie like this is and just enjoy all the jokes and puns that are involved with the movie. I still find it funny at first when he says "he wants a beer ........ cock." funny things. but what makes the film decent is the fact that it's not difficult to create a serious interpretation of the movie, many comedies try to have serious aspects that you simply do not believe. But this is different and just focuses on being funny. I must say though, Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the movie and adds nothing but the top 3 guys, coop, remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the movie great to watch
