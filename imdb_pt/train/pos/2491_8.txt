Budget constraints, time constraints, recording a script and cutting, cutting, cutting ... This team is a group of young filmmakers; thoughtful in this script - yes, allegorical - clever in zero-dollar effects when time and knowledge is all you have, relying on actors and friends and type others for their time, devotion, locations; and getting a first resource in the can, a thing of 1 in 1000. These guys make movies. Good. Check out the collection of short "Heartland Horrors" and see the development. And I can attest, working with them is about the most fun thing you'll do in business. I am frustrated by harsh and insulting criticism of this film, wondering if a reviewer ever heard a word of dialogue, pondered a thought or concept, or if all that was desired of that work was the visual aspect of hitting and cutting to satisfy some irrational vision of what horror should mean to an audience. Let "The Empty Acre" bring it to you. Do not preach what you expect it to be just because it is placed in the horror / suspense genre due to its supernatural premise. It is a drama in depth beyond how far you can stick a blade in someone with a bow for a message that does not assault the visual center of your brain, but rather it is based on the empathic imagination of experiencing the suffering of the mind and spirit . mark ridgway, Curtis, "The Acre Empty"
