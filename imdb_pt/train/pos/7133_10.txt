Absolute masterpiece of a movie! Good evening Mr.Tom has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. No one should miss watching this movie, it's good too! Mr.Tom is perfectly interpreted by John Thaw as the old man who becomes a father figure when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to him for evacuation, almost like "The rat of the city and the mouse of the field". A really painful movie. The director knew exactly how to turn a book into a film and he did it extremely well. The film was so well shot that the emotions of the characters and what was happening made the audience feel a series of emotions, from love to fear, and those emotions could turn into six cents. Set in a turbulent time during World War II, this movie also shows the difference between cities and the countryside, they are almost like different countries. An absolute must see, those who are not missing out on a truly amazing and brilliant film.
