The CB4 was awful, but may have given Cundieff the idea for the better. More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the movie is smart from the start. Surprising who saw it back in the mid-nineties. The performances are played for laughter, but not so much that they are cartoon characters, more like the Marx brothers. These guys are real and a little different. They react to situations as any of us can. Well, we can not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late for the show, or pulling guns and hitting on a record executive, but you get it. N (n) with W (with) H (hats) takes you seriously enough to get you involved, so you're addicted. rent or get it at all costs, even if you do not like rap, it will still let you gas out loud. Comparing this with CB4 is like comparing George Lucas's Star Wars with Gil Gerards 'Buck Rogers' I think you see my point
