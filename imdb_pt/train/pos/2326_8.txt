Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister, Maureen (Emily Warfield), until they both fell in love with neighboring Court (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never disappear. <br /> <br /> This was really a moving story about first love. Probably the most painful story about young love I've ever seen. The whole performance is incredible and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance in his first film. I would give the man on the moon 8.5 / 10
