I also saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was a great movie about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was funny, hot, moving, touching, and fun. A movie like this would do very well with word of mouth. I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this movie. Let's just hope they get the chance. I would rate this movie as one of the best movies I've seen in a year. It does not contain violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so obviously distributors question whether or not they should seek it. Believe me, there are people out there who would love to see a movie like that one that has redeeming value, instead of the many typical box-office blockbusters we usually get.
