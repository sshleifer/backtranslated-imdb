In the garbage sea that Hollywood (and others) continue to launch, this is one of those rough diamonds. A small and simple movie that is a lot of fun and leaves you with the feeling that you have not lost an hour and a half of your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really amazing in this movie. I've never really been a fan or had noticed her before, but coming back and seeing this initial presentation from her convinced me that she is extremely talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was a chore in a college course for me, so I was skeptical that I would care. I thought, "Oh, boy, some stupid male film or feminist ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without reviewing the many relevant topics, I'll just say, if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out. Sometimes the realistic slice-of-life movies are the best, and that's great.
