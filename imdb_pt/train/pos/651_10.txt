** Possible spoilers ** I like this movie and I have no problem staying awake by it. It reminds me of me at age 20, except that it's even better. As Veronica says, two girls at the same time. This enhances the horny in me, the casual conversation, these two real-life cubs, rather than prostitutes, teasing us every step of the way. I get into the conversations too. Even if they are totally b. sometimes, so what? All the girls, almost all of them, who I've talked to and are on top of themselves, are usually filled with the same self-centered self-centered irrationality. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and as sensible as that other b.s. Puppies of philosophy are often in: astrological maps. The only deal with this movie is that the guy is almost as female as the women, he's in the same b. and bad mood. The brunette girl is actually the most masculine person there. <br /> <br /> I think it's kind of funny that the brunette girl is so obviously connected by Veronica. She'd love to take Alexander's blonde, but Veronica plays it all the way. She is brilliant. She grabs the brunette thinking there is something between them, and then she steals the boy-child / man, which is only appropriate, since they seem to be from the same age group. The brunette knows that she was taken to the end when she is putting her face in the palm of her hands while Marlene Deitrich sings to the bottom that, to paraphrase, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I just have that refrain. /> <br /> But do they get married in the end, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm I can only imagine a super tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-wedding breakup. They are too selfish to be with each other other than trampolines. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. It kept me entertained, has a cool look and is sexy.
