If you have any clue about the production of Jane Austen, now she repeats the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made from their novels are a bit boring, but I like the characters of Austen, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings that they like to repeat as well as Emma. What makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her leading role. Also the fact that each of the characters in the movie does not seem to be able to think of anything, but how to get a good partner and soon get married makes the movie hilarious.
