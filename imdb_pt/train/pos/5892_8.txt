Thomas Ince has always had the gift of bringing simple home-made stories to life with fullness and talent. "The Italian" is one of those films. Solid acting, particularly by George Beban, the father of silent child actor George Beban Jr., and wonderful ensembles conveys a realistic sense of first immigrant slums in New York. These give this 1915 film an authenticity that is unusual in characteristics of this vintage. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the modern day and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) reading a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we transition to history with George playing the immigrant. He raises enough money to bring his bride from Italy to America, marry her and have a child with her. But times are hard and the family struggles to survive. I wondered why the mother did not breastfeed her child and avoid the complications with the dirty formula, but okay, even the initial Dream Factory was promoting correct political behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban gets a chance to take revenge on a crime boss who has inadvertently put him in jail, and at the last minute he decides against the planned course of action. Very clean. Loved the curtain effect, it was great. Wonderful use of lighting in this film. <br /> I give "The Italian" an 8 out of 10.
