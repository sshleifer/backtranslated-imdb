After plunging her feet into the giallo pool with the masterful film "The Strange Vice by Mrs. Wardh" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed that same year with what turns out to be another suspense thriller, "The Case of the Scorpion's Tail." Like its previous effort, this one is starring George Hilton, who would act in Martino's satanic hybrid / "All the Colors of the Dark" the following year. "Scorpion's Tail" also features actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would represent an unhappy couple (to say the least!) In Martino's "Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key." (I love that title!) I suppose Edwige Fenech was busy the month they recorded! Anyway, this film has the elegant direction that Martino's fans would expect, as well as a winding plot, some finely made murder pieces, and beautiful filming on location in Athens. The story this time concerns an insurance researcher (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here looking like Farrah Fawcett's prettiest and smarter sister) who was involved in a series of horrific murders following a plane crash and inheritance of $ 1 million for a beautiful widow. . I really thought I had this photo in the middle of the road, but I was completely wrong. Although the plot makes perfect sense in this giallo, you may have to watch the movie again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. The highlights of the picture, to me, were Anita's cat-and-mouse wrestling with the killer at the end, a particularly suspenseful home invasion and a nifty fight over a tiled roof; A lot of good action explodes in this movie! The good guys at No Shame should be thankful for another great DVD, with subtitles and interesting extras. Whotta great clothes turned out to be, in their continuing quest to bring those lost Italian jewels back from oblivion.
