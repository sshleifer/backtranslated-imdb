Chris and Andre are two average teenagers. Misunderstood by some and chosen by others. But together they get up and everyone pays. Together they form "The Army of the Two." They plan and plan "Zero Day". That day is when they decide to invade high school and inevitably kill 14 people in cold blood. Told through the tapes they made "Zero Day", it's just a fiction told about the Columbine tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Zero Day" is one of those movies that will tinker with your head after. The two main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do such a good job that their characters look like almost all marginalized teenagers walking down the street. Their performances were very convincing, you kind of liked these guys and that was scary. Shot on video almost totally from the teenager's perspective, "Zero Day" looks very real and authentic, as if you were there. These kids try to streamline their actions to the viewer and the actors sell to you. But be warned that tragedy follows from beginning to end and that the end is shocking and uncomfortable for some.
