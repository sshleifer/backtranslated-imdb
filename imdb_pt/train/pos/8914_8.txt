I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The city where Jerry's market was. I remember all my family leaving to watch the filming. I remember a guy showing "Blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to share that my mother was in the movie. Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsaut and she was sick one night and they saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for some pictures behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell until her passing last August. My mother was not a teenager and she was only a few months after giving birth to my baby sister.
