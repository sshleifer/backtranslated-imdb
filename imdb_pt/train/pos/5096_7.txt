This is a sprawling remake (4 hours) of Rider Haggard's story, with the usual female addition and a weird subplot of Russian soldiers searching for a "Stone of Power" buried along with King Solomon's treasure. It is very well filmed, giving a vivid notion of the wide open spaces of Africa and very well represented. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who hires Quatermain to help rescue her father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of the Russian soldiers (not mentioned in the IMDb list) are also memorable. For all that Hollywood can not leave a good story alone when it adapts it, this one is well told and, except that it is very long, I liked it. 6/10
