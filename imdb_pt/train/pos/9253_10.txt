Well, the movie is not exactly "funny". <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit, there are some HUMOROUS lines, but definitely nothing that's funny. For example: shortly before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male colleagues, sh is handcuffed to the head of the bed and can not take off her blouse. Before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he tells her, "Okay, do not go anywhere." <br /> <br /> See, humorous, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting is very good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She is sexy and sexy and has a very hot scene with her that you can not avoid coming back and watching again. <br /> <br /> There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative teasing. lines. <br /> <br /> In total, 5 stars. I would only give three if it was not for Erika Eleniak.
