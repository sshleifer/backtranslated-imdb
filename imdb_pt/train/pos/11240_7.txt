The low budget British melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, becomes one and then finds everything too. Good cast and sense of time and place can not hide the fact that we've all been here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice looks a lot like the Mini Mouse! She disappeared from view soon after making this movie - so life can imitate art! A must see if you want to see a punk version of a star is born though.
