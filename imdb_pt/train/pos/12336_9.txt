An excellent period of melodrama murder, with Fontaine effectively playing against her previous naive wallflower type, in a role that would have Olivia DeHavilland refused. All right, because Fontaine is wonderful. Roteirizado by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the 1930s and also wrote the excellent script for the classic British horror film Night of the Demon. The opening scene, where Ivy visits a sinister fortune teller, played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (the protagonist of James Whale's fame), is a tour de force, and the film maintains the interest by the numerous sinister machinations. I hope to see this movie on DVD someday, but the desperation of it happens because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure movie. Luckily I saw him at AMC some seven or eight years ago, but I have not seen him since. Capture if you can!
