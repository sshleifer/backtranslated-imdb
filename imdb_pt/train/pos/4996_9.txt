I've seen tons of HK actioners, and this one is well on top of the genre. The action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie. The kung fu is spectacular, the eye-popping pyrotechnics, the stunt work to stop the heart. The editing is perfectly paced, increasing the tension and complementing the camera's fluid work. This film is directed by old pro Corey Yuen, whose resume is packed with some of the best works of its kind, including the Jet Li Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is one thing missing in this film is the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the male leader, comes closer. This movie is full of archetypes instead of characters - the sexy killer, the silly thief and his bitch girlfriend, the cackling villains. That said, Shannon Lee has a great on-screen presence; she is great with the fighting, the acrobatics and the weapons. When she's on the screen, it's hard to take her eyes off her. She's so good. Why is not this woman a big star?
