Judy Davis shows us here why she is one of Australia's most respected and beloved actors - her portrait of a lonely, unguided nomad is top notch. The teenager Claudia Karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of the country's most popular actors in the years to come, with future roles in THE BIG ROWAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DATING THE ENEMY, RISK, and the acclaimed TV series THE SECRET VIDA (By the way, Karvan, as a child, was a little girl whose Panda toy was stolen outside a pharmacy in the 1983 GOING DOWN drama with Tracey Mann.) If this movie shows up, be sure to check it out !! Classification: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, POSSESSION VAGA, LANTANA.
