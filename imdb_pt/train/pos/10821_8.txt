I also saw it on its release in 1956, and I've been hit since with its final scene. If this is a response to 'High Noon' then it is an appropriate and appropriate response. The notion that, as this chord is going, "The city unites" is a far stronger message than the solitary personal heroism of "High Noon." In this theme, 'Concho' is a phenomenal precursor to one of my all-time favorites, 'The Magnificent Seven'. Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra's transformation from younger brother to liberator of the liberating city. I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family in whom over the years I have inflicted my affection on this film will have the opportunity to try it out for themselves.
