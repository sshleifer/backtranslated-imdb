I watched this movie after watching Practical Magic, and the older movie was far superior. I liked the way the lighting, the make-up and the costumes changed when Gillian changed the story. Jimmy Stewart's mannerisms did not do much for me in this movie, but I suppose they served to highlight Gillian's character reserve. I was also struck by Nicky and Gillian's mannerisms - it was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and Gillian turned up masculine. The gestures that Nicky makes when he shows Redlich his powers impressed me. I never thought witches were effeminate, so it was an interesting way to contrast these characters.
