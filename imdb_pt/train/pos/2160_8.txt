This movie is about a man who was very stuck with the success convention, trying to always be up, working hard so he could boast of owning his own home. He assumes that this is all there is to life until he accidentally starts dancing, all because he wanted to see more closely a beautiful girl that he sees in the dance studio every day while riding subway on the way home. <br /> <br /> He was in love with her at first, going to dance class just to idolize her, but he finally lets himself go and enters the dance. Eventually, it becomes clear to him that there is more to life than working to the death. There are a bunch of eccentric characters also learning in the studio, giving the film lots of laughter and some sense of connection between the discouraged. <br /> <br /> There are also revelations from various characters including the girl he initially admired, giving some depth to them, showing their past stained and their struggle to overcome it. <br /> <br /> The dance was also engaging, with the big competition at the end, but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out on top, winning. Instead, there are falls, revelations, and redemption. <br /> <br /> All this makes for an exciting and entertaining movie to watch.
