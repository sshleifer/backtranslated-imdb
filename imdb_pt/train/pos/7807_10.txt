The performance of each actor and actress (in the film) is EXCELLENT NATURAL, which is what the acting of the film should be; and the steering ability is so brilliantly manipulated in every detail that I never tire of seeing it over and over again. However, I am quite surprised to see that this movie is not included in some of the actors and director, Attenborough's credits intriguing me: are not they proud to make a claim that they have made an excellent and long-lasting movie for the movie? public? I hope to get some answers to my puzzles from someone (possibly one of the film's "connoisseurs").
