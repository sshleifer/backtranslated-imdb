This movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season. It celebrates a quality best described as simple old sympathy. Morgan Freeman plays a character very much like Freeman himself - a successful actor who turns 70. He traveled to a small, dirty grocery store with the intention of researching a role he could play as manager of such a place. He soon deceives the staff and customers, especially the lovely, if irritable, young man (Paz Vega) who chairs the checkout lane "10 items or less". <br /> <br /> 10 Items Or Less do not have an important statement to make and do not pretend it happens. It follows Freeman and Vega when they become friendly, and how the older man offers his advice in exchange for a ride home - the movie seller who is supposed to get him never shows up and Freeman forgot his own phone number. he can not ask for help. I had a little blues affair on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York and this movie healed what ailed me.
