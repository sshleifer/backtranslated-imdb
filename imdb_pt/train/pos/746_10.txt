When I get to the "back side" of 35, I find myself shaking my head more and more at the crazed, sexually-influenced teenagers of today. It was great to be reminded that he was as crazy to me in my time as to the teenagers of today. This film takes that point to the core. If you're a fan of the late 70's, you'll love the movie. From KISS posters to an Angel concert, this movie rocks! <br /> <br /> Pay attention to a young Laura Dern. Why do not they have more songs from The Runaways that I'll never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with Randy Quaid's character deflowering a 16-year-old girl. While he was away, she and her friends had a party that destroyed the guy's house. The cops come and everything but there is no mention of any underage drinking and how these children have in their hands on this material. <br /> <br /> Foxes belongs right there with Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused, and Kids as one of the teen angst movies. <br /> <br /> I say buy and watch with your kids and talk about it all.
