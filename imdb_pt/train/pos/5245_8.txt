I thought this movie was funny. It's a fun movie, not to be taken seriously, about the distorted visions of a man about life, love and ... well, ladies "from the humble skank of the bus station, to the high class debucker ... bus station". Tim Meadows plays a guy (Leon Phelps) who was raised in a Playboy style mansion by a father figure of Hugh Hefner-esquire, constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" expels him on the street, he must learn to defend himself only with the chauvinistic vision of life that his youth taught him ... and with an unfathomable and almost mystical level of charm and luck. And so the hijinx begins! If you have not yet watched this movie and enjoy a love story / comedy, no spirit, no enthusiasm, it is highly recommended to rent "The Ladies Man".
