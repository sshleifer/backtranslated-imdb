Even though this movie was released a year before I was born, it's definitely one of my favorite comedies. He stars in Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he knows nothing about what it means to be gay and has all these stereotypical notions of how gay people are. His son, Norman, is now grown and lives alone. When his father, Ben, discovers that his son is gay, he pays a visit to his son in hopes of changing him. The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie - when Ben arrives at Norman's apartments, he meets a prostitute and thinks he's his son on the street ("Norman ... is that you?"). The movie made me laugh from start to finish. Redd Foxx is great. Although much of the content is stereotyped, I find nothing offensive about how the material was treated, and even has a good ending. Highly recommended.
