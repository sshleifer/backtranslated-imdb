This is really a great Hal Roach short. This is because of two main reasons: The smallest children in short are among the cutest who have ever been in the movie and the plot has so many funny and well written elements. As for the smallest of the Little Rascals, I honestly can not think of a prettier boy than Spanky around the age of four. Despite being a rather chubby and unattractive kid in recent years, he was just precious here. And, putting the little boy in charge of taking care of even younger children was not only funny but again loud at the fluffy factor. <br /> <br /> After the older children blackmail Spanky to do this awful babysitting job, all sorts of funny chaos loosen up. The jokes are quite effective and well made for the time - with an accidental crank call involving a murder and a final scene where Spanky FINALLY gets control of the little ones being the most memorable. I have not seen these shorts in many decades and I'm glad I gave this a try.
