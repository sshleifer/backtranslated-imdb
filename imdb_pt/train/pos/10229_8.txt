YETI deserves the 8-star rating because it's one of the biggest bad movies ever made. I saw it at a midnight session in LA and people were roaring and applauding insanity - this movie is one of those cinematic train tremors where you think it can not be weird and THEN DOES! The millionaire who funds the project to melt the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman got dressed badly - the guy who plays the scientist is one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen - and yes, there is a dumb kid a girl) and he's mute since he survived an airplane crash that killed his parents (hmmm - maybe therapy for the child ??). So this hot Italian girl is seen by the Yeti (since he thaws - which ALWAYS takes) - and he is instantly in love with her - which is one of the most hysterical things in the movie is that this giant Yeti makes "bedroom eyes "to her - it's like a great Barry White trying to seduce a groupie. In fact, once the great Yeti catches the hottie and holds it to the chest - she accidentally touches the Yeti's nipple, and yes, the film takes time to show off her large gray nipple. Yikes of all YIKES! Also, there is a collie dog because the Italian producer must have heard that the American public likes dogs and he kind of tried to get a Lassie - there's also that insane scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish - keeps the big fishbone and he uses it to comb the hair of the Italian girl "Wow, thank you Yeti - now my hair is smooth and it smells like dead trout. This movie is more bizarre than anything Ed Wood could have dreamed of. If you're a fan of the classic cinema crap - look out for this baby.
