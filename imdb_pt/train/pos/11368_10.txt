A surprisingly complex and well-crafted study of serial killer "The First" in the USSR. Defined in perestroika days this intense piece is brought to life filled with the performances of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> This examination of Cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and insinuating some of his behaviors while showing others, there is a subtlety that is attractive without being explicitly explicit. Not for the faint of heart, however, as the subject is often disturbing, but necessary for the full development of the main participants in this story based on facts. <br /> <br /> HBO provided us with an excellent movie in an unusual way. . Congratulations to the director and editor of this great play. It's in my Top 10 should see the list.
