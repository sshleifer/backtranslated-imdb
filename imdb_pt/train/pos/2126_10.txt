Much about love and life can be learned by observing people in the SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch had another quiet triumph added to his credit with this lovely film. With brilliant dialogue (courtesy of long-time collaborator Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances from an abundantly talented cast of artists, he has created a truly memorable film. Always believing to play with the intelligence of his viewers, and favoring sophistication instead of clowning, the director invented a repaginated and shimmering cinematography seasoned with that indescribable and enigmatic quality known as the "Lubitsch" ring. <br /> <br /> Although the story is set in Budapest (and there is a confusion of accents among the players) this does not matter. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any large American city or small town could easily be the locus of action. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the employees are passionate about romance and then with each of them. another - not knowing. His dialogue - so cleverly treated to look all natural - conveys perfectly his confusion and his silent despair as they seek soul mates. Of them is one of the classic love stories of cinema. <br /> <br /> Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, that of a man whose transient importance in his world is broken when he sees a horn. An accomplished scene thief, he does not allow any emotion to escape without being aired. In addition, Morgan provides the film with his most joyful moments - near the end - when he determines that the youngest employee in his impoverished young shop enjoys a memorable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut adds another vivid representation to his list of screen portraits, this time that of a pretentious Lothario who carefully deserves the punishment eventually bestowed upon him. Gentle Felix Bressart has his best role in the cinema as a family man who really can not afford to get involved in shop intrigues but remains a steadfast friend of Stewart's. <br /> Sara Haden graces the small role of a salesman. William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious boy scout who takes advantage of unexpected to leverage the sales force. <br /> <br /> In small roles, Charles Halton plays a Frankish detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous. doctor. The filmmakers will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord - both uncredited - in their only scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother and aunt.
