In the approach of her centenary, Saura gathered an unprecedented wealth of talents from the Spanish performing arts community to create this love song par excellence in her homeland. The twelve "impressions" of the suite are presented without narrative in austere environments, allowing the power of each performance to explode before the Saura camera. The creative use of large flats and mirrors, moved across the stage, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection, add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of music, dance and instrumental performance. Photographs of Albeniz reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of music to its great creator. Saura encompasses all the Spaniards on their stage, from the beautiful elegance of old flamenco dancers in traditional costumes to children dancing happily with their instructors.
