"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful, haunting and incredibly provocative movie. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who in 1980 witnessed a horrible sight seeing her 3-month-old baby brutally taken from her family's tent while camping in the Australian backcountry. Azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of its horrendous disappearance caused a real frenzy of life around the world. Meryl Streep does justice to Lindy's role, as she always does. But the only thing that helps "The Cry in the Dark" never fall is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate view on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. The concept is nothing less than scary, and then you are haunted but also inspired.
