Not only is this film fun, with excellent comedic acting, but also politically interesting. It was made at the end of the Soviet Union, but it mocks the Soviet mentality. History is defined during the early days of the Soviet Union, and questions the logic behind the revolution, both in cultural and practical terms. Of course, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the bizarre restraints of Soviet society are already relaxed, but ideology and mentality are still alive and well prepared for well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all this profound philosophical commentary is wrapped in a fun and fun package! <br /> <br />
