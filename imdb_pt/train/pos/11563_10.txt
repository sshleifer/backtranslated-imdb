I saw this many years after the television series and initially I did not care about it. Then, as my memory of the series receded over time, I watched again, and found it utterly hilarious. Based on Neil Simon's stage, he was not very open to the big screen, and that's one of his strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the supporting cast is wonderful, particularly John Fielder as 'Vinnie'. Even now, certain moments can tear me to tears - Felix interrupting Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request, Oscar laughing and chasing Felix around the apartment, the giggles 'Pigeon Sisters' brought on by Felix's eyebrow stories and , of course, the legendary cafe scene (later ripped off by 'When Harry Met Sally' by Nora Ephron). Extremely clear dialogue too. When the boys think Felix has taken an overdose, Oscar says, "They can be vitamins! He may be the healthiest in the room!" Fantastic!
