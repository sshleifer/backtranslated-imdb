I read Nancy Drew as a preteen and collected the books as an adult. I loved the effect used at the end (and a little bit in the beginning) of the film, where book-style line drawings turned into movie scenes. It was a cool way to pinpoint connections between situations in the film and in books. For example, scenes with the Oriental Antique dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios I remember from books. I thought Ned was perfectly scaled up and Emma Roberts was a wonderful interpretation of Nancy Drew's 21st century. (Like the picture of Betty Crocker, she follows the times!)
