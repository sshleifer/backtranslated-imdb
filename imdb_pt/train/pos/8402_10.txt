The VAN is a simple teensploitation image made especially for the unit in which it goes out of its way to make you feel comfortable, providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small but plentiful role as a car wash manager and almost steals the show! All the leads are well represented, the characters complex and the direction quite competent for this type of image. An international crown release.
