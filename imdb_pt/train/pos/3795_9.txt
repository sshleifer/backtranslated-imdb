After seeing this movie at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to know how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk about the film that presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film portraying minorities (women, nonwhite) working on controversial issues (teenage pregnancy, teenage motherhood, identity racial, single-parent families), and how to write a faithful script on all these topics, being a white man in his mid-thirties. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly enthusiastic adults about the movie's fantastic plot, detailed characters and fantastic portrayal of "real-life teen." Most teens, however, left the building - leading me to think that this is a better movie seen by adults with children as a starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults felt, "a movie which teens should see because it's about them. " So, distribution issues - how can we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great way - this is a movie that will be buried, like "Puppies" or other modern radical teen movies - and McKay seemed receptive. As for his credits as a writer / director, McKay was extremely sensitive and detailed in his work - allying himself with the neighborhood of Crown Heights in which the film goes, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be - with the results being frighteningly realistic.
