This had a good story ... had a good rhythm and all the characters were developed. <br /> <br /> I watched a lot of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best I've seen in the two weeks. <br /> <br /> Jason Bigg's character was the best though. <br /> <br /> Even though it was small, it was cleverly worked from the start. <BR> <BR> This may be a romantic comedy and I do not like it any more, but the writing, direction, performance, sound, overall design across the capacity was really cool. <br /> <br /> This movie did a great job on all the movies I've seen lately - and the rest was well publicized or best publicized. <br /> <br /> Good written work.
