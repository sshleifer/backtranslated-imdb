I really liked this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between American military men and Japanese women in postwar Japan - as well as the obstacles that prejudice has created for them. Brando no longer has contempt for the Japanese (which is natural, considering World War II) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry her. His performance is good (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the movie is wonderful everywhere. Red Buttons received an Oscar for his touching performance of another GI who falls in love with Japan (although the Japanese who play with him have also done a remarkable job). <br /> <br /> I do not want to ruin everything. but the movie is good to watch with a box of tissues. <br /> <br /> This movie can say SOMETHING and be fun at the same time. A gem despised.
