There is no way to confront 'Zabriskie Point' from a rational point of view or try to describe it using words and conventions that you would use for other films. That's because it's not a movie. It is an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have somehow become as mundane as a movie. What we see are not the unfolding of a plot, but a sequence of events that we do not see in the movies every day, but we imagine that it will happen as the backdrop that we ourselves will provide when we hear of some tragic event in the news of friends . We see our imagination of people who are abstractions for us - no one we know of, but we no doubt hear about them in a book, on TV, or somewhere. So, what do we see? Events We see people arguing, driving, and inevitably running away. Only the escape is something intangible - it is the collective situation and the cruelty that the mass of a civilization allowed to exist by laziness or ... human nature. Set in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, our players act against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern existence. These creatures are effectively blank sheets that can display any trait that we can imagine if we wish. Although the actions taken may be considered criminal or irresponsible, the characters are not criminals. They are human beings who seek a return to a familiar, non-manufactured existence that is beyond the normality they experience every day. Not that they are always happy or sad, but achieve a kind of self-realization when they move beyond and beyond the suicide of modern life. They only attain true life in the natural world, although this is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, "Zabriski Point" is a compliment of the humanities' attachment to the natural world. As even the most desolate parts of the earth succumb to our notions of progress, we lose our souls on the road to the death of the human spirit.
