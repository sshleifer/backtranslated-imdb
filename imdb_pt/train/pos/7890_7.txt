Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film to present Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or a co-star). Years of murder affected the city of Springwood. It has reached the point where the small town has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger so many years ago paid the final price. Only the crazy ones inhabit the city and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But that does not stop Freddy from looking for his latest revenge. No matter how they try to stop it, it always comes back for more. But this time he discovers a little more about his old life. Can children finally stop Freddy forever? What is this secret that's buried in Freddy's twisted mind? to find out you will have to watch Freddy's Dead. the end was originally shot in 3-D. <br /> <br /> An appropriate way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he starts coming out in a bang! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger star in this last chapter. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the last, but it's full of some dated jokes. If you like the series then you do not want to miss this one. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend this movie to Freddy's fans.
