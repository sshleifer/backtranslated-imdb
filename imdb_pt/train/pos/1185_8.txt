Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger exchange cat roles they had on "All the brothers were brave". Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his role of evil, but Granger does his part perfectly. However, the real hero of the story is the bison and the northwest. The film is done perfectly, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given. The direction is tense and although the film is not a carefree entertainment, it is, in my opinion, a great movie, unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti.
