Ying, a Chinese girl who speaks Czech, invited us to the exhibition of a Czech film (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). It was the first time I saw Samotaři (Loners, 2000) and it was very good. Like many other Czech films, the seven central characters seem to have a very difficult and dirty life; the web indicates that this theme was popular with US films in the early 1990s. Their relationships are separating, combining, and recombining. Another characteristic typical of Czech films is that none of the characters is designed to be a universal negative and none of them is permanently positive. In addition, you can see how the characters judge the resources of others, depending on the context; this is a very realistic feature of the film's psychological analysis. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a young, talented, married surgeon who has two daughters. However, you learn that he only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman, Hanka. He is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses as a plumber to enter the house of Hanka's parents - a house he repeatedly burns. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents. She just decides - flipping a coin - to break up with Petr, who works at a private radio station. Hanka does not see the bourgeois life of his parents as a good example, but seems somewhat unsuccessful in creating a better environment. But she's a very flexible figure, as far as her kind of boyfriend goes. <br /> <br /> For a while, Hanka seems to have serious plans with Jakub, an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be quite devastated. for drugs. However, his band's friends inform Jakub that he already has another girlfriend. Hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Petr finish, she is organized by Robert, a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the lives of ordinary Czechs. people for Japanese tourists. Robert - who also supplies marijuana to Jakub - never talks serious about anything and usually sleeps with many different women; eventually his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways of coping with depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (a Slavic word for "spring") that came to Prague from Macedonia works as a waitress - and you will not know if she came to the Czech Republic to see your father or UFOs. She seems rather confused, but sometimes helps the other characters in their problems. Petr works at the radio station and he's the only one who likes his job - a job he eventually loses. He announces to his audience that he has ended with Hanka - which is how Ondřej learns about the news that make him very happy. <br /> <br /> Finally, Ondřej's wife, Lenka, is always ready to forgive him and stabilize his marriage - even after Ondřej asks a wizard to make him disappear for Ondřej to try to capture Hanka again. (The wizard pays his debt because he is the brother of a victim of a major car accident - Jakub and Hanka take the victim to the hospital and Ondřej saves his life.) Lenka also works for the travel agency - as a translator - and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for about 20 Japanese tourists who are filming their films during Hanka's parents' dinner. <br /> <br /> The seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude. Given the actual size of the Czech capital, it seems a little unlikely that all these events will occur between seven people, but it's fun.
