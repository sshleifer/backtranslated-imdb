I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think she's the kind of actress who'd better not act before the camera, but be her own. She did it, and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, she tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the movie, so she looked more like a sober editor. While in the other half, she put herself back into her daily routine, and I could not tell her to be a publisher anyway. Therefore, his performance is not lasting in this film. <br /> <br /> The film, on the whole, is attractive and inspiring. Young's character is complete and reasonable. Anyway, the film tells a great and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only major flaw is that it did not show a turning point in the hero's and heroine's love story. I'm totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story because this is not clear to both people.
