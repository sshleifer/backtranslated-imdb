I was a little skepticle if I should watch this when it was first shown on CBS. I was one of the many people who were in New York that day, I was going to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the diversion and carnage again, but like many, I was curious to see what it was all about. Tears came to my eyes watching this documentary. All my memories came back and only the intense images were unbelievable. I bought the DVD on a year anniversary and watched it a few times. How these guys managed to capture this footage was incredible. If you have not seen this documentary yet, do yourself a favor and check it out. It is obviously depressing and will bring tears to the eyes, but it is an incredible document of the darkest hour of this country.
