A great concept, a great cast and what a pity there would be no more time to detail the story. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, there are now some REAL WOMEN! Still, Dench and his character had enough substance to carry the script in some of its minor moments. I have it on tape and I will continue to watch it, hoping there will be a clue at the end that suggests there will be a continuation. <br /> <br /> Top drawer! - No question! - No argument! <br /> <br />
