Based on St. Louis by Robert Louis Stevenson, the film tells the story of a young French hussar captain (Jean Marc Barr) during the Napoleonic wars. Captured in battle, he is sent to a prisoner of war camp in the Highlands of Scotland, led by Major Farquhar (Richard E Grant). Soon he falls in love with a local girl (Anna Friel), befriends the major, and discovers that his long lost grandfather, who fled France during the revolution, lives on the road! Spirited performances from the entire cast and a few memorable lines make this an above-average offer.
