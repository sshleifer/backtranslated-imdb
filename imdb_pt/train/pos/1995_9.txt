I just saw this recently, after an interval of almost forty years. It holds up well, especially the prominent songs of Lionel Bart. ("Who Will Buy" with its magic counterpoint, just one of many highlights.) I do not agree with the other post that condemned the G rating. The new rating system at the time never intended for the G rating (General) meant "completely devoid of conflict." <br /> <br /> Featuring it as inappropriate for children, remind me of the description I once saw of The Wizard of Oz: A girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she meets. She then goes on a trip with three male mates and kills again.
