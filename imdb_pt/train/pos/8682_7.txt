I am sad to say that I disagree with other people in this episode of Columbus. Death Lend a Hand is frankly a boring Columbus species to me. After a couple of times, I get bored and change channels. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator of the character of Ray Milland. He hires him to investigate his beautiful young wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she's having an affair. In return, the character of Culp blackmails the traitorous wife who plans to expose his scheme to the husband ruining his career. Angrily, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and putting her body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I just did not care. Of course, Columbus picks it up at the end. It's just the question of how.
