While it is certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunkard, there is such a charm in Dudley Moore's interpretation of a kindly exuberant, Arthur Bach that one can not help but feel for this unique and wonderful character. How can you not have fun with that contagious laughter, giggle and total foolishness? Although I'm not really a fan of Liza Minnelli, she was really excellent as Linda Marolla and I could not imagine anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and earned his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also great and that great tune "Arthur's Theme", wow. Truly this was one of the best comedies of the '80s. Big films look better with every performance and this is the case with "Arthur".
