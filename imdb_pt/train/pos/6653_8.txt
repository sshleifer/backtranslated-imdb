Keeping all political opinions aside, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor "Gandhi, My Father" is a good movie that cleverly explores the confusing side of the family of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, and the struggle of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with society, his father greater than life, and most important demons in his head. A parallel plot with Gandhi, the father of the nation, and fights that any son could have with his father. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Shephali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna - strictly in that order - add color and emotion to this painful story of Harilal, who cries to be held only once and also flees with the slightest touch of the finger. <br /> <br /> The direction of Feroz Khan and the production screen are luxurious and attractive, however, the script could have been more rigorous. I had seen the piece a few years ago on a kind of pirated DVD video (it was called Mahatama vs. Gandhi, I think) and it was certainly more exciting. However, the film's soundtrack and parent-child and mother-child moments are just a brilliant treat. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been great. It is borderline for that. It has the potential so great to have been just a history difference between father and son or just Gandhi or even both. Somewhere, the plot is lost and when you expect an absolute epitome of emotions, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> He compares decently with other Gandhi's. Certainly not a general film like Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstract as Hey Ram by Kamal Hassan. The film can almost find its foundation; however, one wonders "what if ..." Worth a watch. 7.5 / 10
