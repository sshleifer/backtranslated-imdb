There are very few movies that are as funny as this. I was lucky enough to watch this movie in a "reserved" movie theater for movie fans like me, so it was not so embarrassing to sit there laughing until my jaw was completely sore and the sleeves of my shirt were wet to dry my eyes. Sometimes the story was a little 'slow', but that's maybe the best - a bit of rest between the bearing between the runners (I almost fell off the seat ...) went very well Come on.
