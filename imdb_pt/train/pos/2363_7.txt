This adaptation of the MR James tale 'A View From A Hill' was first shown on British television in 2005 on the BBC4 little-watched digital channel. I saw it being replayed on BBC 4 and I decided to give it a go, remembering the BBC's successful 1970s adaptations of other MR James stories, including 'Whistle and I'll get to you, my boy' and 'The signalman'. Although not from the same class as these masterpieces, "A View From A Hill" is a pleasant and sometimes suspenseful drama. <br /> <br /> A historian arrives in a small rural village to examine the recently deceased collector's collection of ancient artifacts. While in the field, he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a horrible legend about the ominously named Gallows Hill? And what does the grumpy squire and his servant know about the situation? Although not scary at all, I enjoyed this small production, and if the runtime was longer than 40 minutes, it could have become a great fit. As it is, everything seems a bit rushed and a little more exposure to set the mood would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10.
