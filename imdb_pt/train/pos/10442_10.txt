This is truly one of the best love movies I have ever seen. Closely followed by none other than "Before Sunset", which technically is not another film, since it is about the same two people and the same novel. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. . Okay, that's only if most people are as smart and eloquent as the movie's leaders. Reading the other reviews, it pleases me to know how so many other people are crazy about movies based on dialogues as well. And that's what makes "Before Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so engaging and funny. It's no surprise that Jesse and Celine fall in love because you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in the cafeteria, where they pretend to call. his best friends, with the other pretending to be said best friend. Is perfect. Bring back the moment you fell in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I must say that if you have a choice, watch "Before Sunrise" before watching "Before Sunset". "If like me, you watched" Sunset "first, it is difficult to get rid of the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Once again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. <br /> <br /> Wonderful acting, excellent script and beautiful locations. <br /> Young love, is the best.
