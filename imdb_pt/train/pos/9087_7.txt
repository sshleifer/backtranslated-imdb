Saxophonist Ronnie Bowers (Dick Powell) wins a studio contract and goes to Hollywood. It is in the Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time, big selfish star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a tantrum and refuses to watch the premiere of his new image. In a panic, the studio hires Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to get past her and have Bowers take her to the premiere, not saying it's not Marshall. Of course they fall in love. You may well discover the rest of the plot alone. <br /> <br /> The plot is old (to say the least), but Powell and Rosemary Lane make a very nice couple and have beautiful singing voices. The score is good (highlighted by "Hooray for Hollywood") and director Busby Berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in musical sequence (with Edgar Kennedy doing his patented slow burning). Also Glenda Farrell has some funny parts like sister Jonesie from Monas. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is not so good. The rest of the cast mugs fiercely and most of the humor is not funny. Lola Lane, especially, sucks trying to play Mona as a comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black maid is fought for laughter and there is a truly terrifying racist "mood" at one point. That's probably what keeps it off the TV most of the time. I realized it was accepted at the time, but that looks revolting nowadays. <br /> <br /> Everything in a movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs. I give a 7.
