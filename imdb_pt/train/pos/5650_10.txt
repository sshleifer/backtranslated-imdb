"Someones at the Door". OHHH, How I miss this show so bad .. but we are lucky to have now "Invasion". Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, had everything. If I had to choose one thing that I liked most about the show, it would have to be "its plot lines not predictable." The favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I love that Southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible, and my kids are fans too. There are some hot and steamy scenes. Some devils, too. So if the little ones are watching, you may want to edit (fastforward / skip). It has humor, on a level of Joss Wheedon, that so many shows are missing. Adult wit and adulthood, who are treated with finese. The DVD has a few extras, but I wish it had many more. If you want to be thrilled and enjoy a great show, come and watch "American Gothic"!
