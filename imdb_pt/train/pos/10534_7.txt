Whether it's a good movie or not, movies like that need to be made, I think. It reminds me of "I love Huckabees," an incredibly intriguing film, with Isabelle Huppert being sodomized by a young American into a muddy lake in a jolly sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). I hope the director continues to cross the border, as if I felt that the choices Vincenzo Natali made were not always subtle (some of the scenes were sadly like "tarte à la crème", as a childish jest). , talking about screenplay and cinematography? The color of "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more joyous, surprisingly, than the old Natali films.
