My roommate ordered this off the web a while ago and I finally got to see it. That's disgusting. It's shocking. It's really dumb ... but it's a lot of fun, too. I mean, that was the most fun we've had watching a movie like this since "City of the Living Dead" centuries ago. It was like being at the old Drive-In Theater again! You could tell the guy who made this movie like all the horrible dubbed zombie movies. This has all the cliches and tricks of these movies in one, and it's cool because it's SUPPOSED to be like this. The cheeze factor is high, the bleeding flows and the laughter rolls! The effects go from sloppy to good, the one in which the guy rips in half and the one in which a guy brings the heart into the chest, both of which are excellent! The acting goes from terrible to really very good. There is not much plot, just lots and lots of gore. This is based on the zombie movies from Italy and Spain, I think, because they stay forever in the disgusting scenes like this movie. If you like Troma movies, cheezy B-grade stuff, then you can not do anything wrong by watching this. A good way to lose a Friday night!
