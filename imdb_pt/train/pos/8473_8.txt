This delightfully delightful and endearing sequel to the hugely successful "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a continuation only in name. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called "Big Bay Ty," who resides deep in the undesirable marshes of Boggy Creek. Two spoiled siblings and their older, more sensible sister (a sweetly animated performance by Dana Plato, star of the series "Different Strokes") will venture into the treacherous swamp to check if the creature of the local legend can actually be a living being real. The trio is hopelessly lost in a ferocious storm, and the furry Sasquatch, like a bear, gigantic but very kind and benevolent comes to the rescue of the children. <br /> <br /> Tom Moore's casual, no-frills direction relates this. A simple story at a leisurely pace, capturing the minutiae of the rural town in extremely precise details, attracting the varied characters of the countryside with great warmth and affection, and happily developing the feeling in an organic, restrained, non-forced manner that never degenerates - sappy mush. Adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") gives a brave portrait of the working-class single mother, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer amusing and irascible support as a couple of girls playing rough-hewn chickens. Robert Bethard's able and sunny cinematography exhibits the wooded environment in all its quiet, painfully pure and fragile sumptuousness untouched by the splendor of civilization. The Darrell Deck track cleverly melds the shudders of synthesizers and the jubilant country banjo-banjo bluegrass into a melancholy sound drink. In addition, this image deserves special praise for the way it oddly predicts the 1990s Bigfoot children's feature for a good 15 and a few years in advance.
