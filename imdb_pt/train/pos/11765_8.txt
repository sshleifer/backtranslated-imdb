This movie surprised me, had good phrases and laughter, + an action-packed plot without stopping tons of gun action and explosions. This movie has surprisingly had many good twists. The plot is solid, despite what others may think, it kept my interest going all the way to the end. In conclusion; this is a great way for a fan of action movies to pass the time.
