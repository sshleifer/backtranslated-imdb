The US State Department would not like us to watch this movie because they have an attack with the Iranian government. However, it shows us how civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the film, which focuses on the struggle of women for equal rights in the simplest of terms: the ability to watch a football game in the stadium, which is strictly limited to the male audience alone. The film is fun, and it is proof of freedom of expression and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this film intensely. Five girls are attempting to penetrate the police border at the gates to a football match between Iran and Bahrain. The resulting comedy is very funny to describe, from the bus ride to the stadium, to the intercession of the police and subsequent detention of the girls, until the resulting end. Do not miss this classic movie. It is a must see. One of the best foreign films I've seen in years.
