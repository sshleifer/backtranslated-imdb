Bette Midler is again Divine! Raunchily humorous. In love with Burlesco. Capable of bringing you to tears with old jokes with new dresses or just with old songs with more power and impact than ever before. All in All Singing new ballads, singing in power the old and perennial ones like "The Rose"; "Stay With Me" and yes, until "Wind Beneath My Wings". The best way to enjoy the Divine Miss M has always been to libe - since this is the next best thing, I strongly recommend everyone with a mixture of wide-eyed adult charm and appreciation and the pernicious desire of a child for forcing every Limits!
