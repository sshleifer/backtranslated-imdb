It's hard to put your finger on this. Basically I suppose it's a comedy about a wealthy idle drunk who falls in love with a poor (comparatively) girl with whom he wants to marry, at the risk of being disinherited by his family. <br /> <br /> There are funny moments. , romantic moments and touching moments. Dudley Moore is funny and somehow makes her egocentric character captivating, Liza Minelli is a compelling figure as the opposite he attracts, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's wonderfully sarcastic butler. but very entertaining with a memorable soundtrack, and ran for almost 3 months in our local fleapit.
