**Notice! Mild Spoilers Ahead! (Yes, I realize it's hard to screw up a historical documentary, but I do reveal some of the history and methods.) This is an exceptional documentary not only because of the remarkable images, but also because of the history behind it. As the Naudets did not set out to tell the story of September 11, but rather a novice firefighter, the emotions of the men and the connection of the spectator with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In the cinematographic sense, "9/11" is a textbook. If events were a real script, they would be superb, as the characters were established, then they would set a curve on which they should react. This is all the more surprising considering the pain and the emotion of the images that the directors had to go through to put this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station; specifically, how a novice joins a veteran team. This part alone is very good, and if the documentary were allowed to perform the intended course, it would probably have been solid. The brothers seem to realistically portray the process of becoming a NYC firefighter. <br /> <br /> So, of course, all hell breaks loose. The chaos that follows the WTC attacks is vividly seen, as several characters we know are thrown into terrible situations. Seeing not only attacks but also first-hand reactions is a very touching picture of extreme human emotion. <br /> <br /> The result, in which firefighters are found to be lost and found, is the human drama at its height. Life and death are in the balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer not only does not know who will live and die, but genuinely cares about them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about it is that Robert DeNiro's comments (which I like) were not informative, unnecessary, and no use in history. They have probably only been added to attract more viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: The best documentary I've ever seen. Unparalleled portraits of raw human emotion and drama. 9.5 out of 10.
