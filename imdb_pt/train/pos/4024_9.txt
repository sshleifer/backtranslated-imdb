I really liked this movie. That made me guess until just before the end what would happen. One of the best movies on the partition I've seen. Urmila Matondkar is beautiful too. This is one of the most personal and realistic movies I have ever seen on the partition. It's a bit less mainstream than Gadar, and it's really an emotional roller coaster where you get an opinion of what's going on, and get out completely on the other side. This is not typical of bollywood cooking, but an art-house type movie. The best part of this movie is that it does not dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when it focuses on another's story. He does not blame or punish, but allows you to draw your own conclusions about things.
