In "Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), middle-aged brothers living together in Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea on Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt a boy from the distant orphanage to help out on his farm. But the orphan sent to them is a precocious 14-year-old girl named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris - a veteran of Disney's "Alice" series of short films that later adopted her character's name). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude Montgomery's romance novel, but the same actress could not move from age 11 to college during the course of history. The film suffers a little from this concession, as many of Anne's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an 11-year-old teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and quick, eager to please but unsatisfied with her name, her constitution, her freckles and her long red hair. Being a child of imagination, however, Anne brings much joy in life, and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Drama Queen" and the screenwriter of the film chose to focus on this aspect of her character. Which turned the basic genre of mildly entertaining family drama into comedy. A change that charmed the public and continues to thwart the purists of the reader. <br /> <br /> Since the comedy is very much in the spirit of Montgomery's history, I see no reason to disagree with the changes, but let this serve as a fair warning to anyone who expects a wholly faithful adaptation. The comedy element is the strength of the film, as it is one of the first self-reflective parodies of Hollywood conventions. Actress Anne Shirley was one of the beauties of Hollywood of all time and the film is in black and white. Much of the fun is in seeing the endless laments of the title character about his appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen. Anne regularly gives away her senseless rural mates with melodramatic lines like, "If you refuse, it will be a lifelong sadness for me." Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom board. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does a good job as the love interest of Anne Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steals every scene in which she appears as Cuthbert's pompous neighbor. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
