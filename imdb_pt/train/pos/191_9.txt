That day, if Marion Davies had had her attention and not just listened to William Randolph Hearst, she would have made more films like Show People and would have been much happier. In fact, when you see her get her first big break in two comedies, she would love to have done it in her career instead of epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you're seeing through all the reports in Show People is the real Davies, a talented comedian, excellent mimicry, and a generous, kind-hearted person. She could actually identify with the character of Peggy Pepper, also known as Patricia Prepoire, she endured her share of pretense in her Hollywood stardom. <br /> <br /> If the plot of Show People were set in the legitimate stage you would call it is a backstage story. I think it's one of the first movies about movies that you could call a story behind the cameras. Marion is anxious young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others, looking for that great chance. She wants drama, but her introduction to filmmaking is the leading role in burlesque comics. She gets her piece of pie and cream on her face, but learns her craft. And also wins the heart of the young comic actor William Haines. <br /> <br /> She gets her first big hit but also does not come to Haines and Marion does legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli. , playing Andre Telfair, pretending not to count the Earl of Avignon. Someone here was taking a shot at actor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and to hear about it, one of the most despised people in the movies. <br /> <br /> Show People was one of the first films to have the unfilled appearances of stars like themselves. You'll be able to see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman etc. just being themselves in and around the movie colony. That alone makes Show People a movie worth saving. Show People also made good use of Tin Pan Alley's standard songs, such as "We't We Got Fun", "I'm Sitting On Top Of The World". You'd be surprised, California. As the film was released at the edge of the sound being presented, a song called Crossroads was introduced into it. It's not a bad number, but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing on the soundtrack. I guess since they are not seen, we felt no charge was required. Still, I'd like to know and I'm sure you'd like to be lucky enough to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand why Marion Davies liked this film so much and considered it personal. favorite. She seems so at home in this movie and her lack of real-life pretension shines in her performance, which makes him a true delight to the public.
