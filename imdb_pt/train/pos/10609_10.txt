I saw this movie last night on cable and it's extraordinary. What I love the most is that it is understated and discreet, but deeply sincere. The performance of Henry Thomas (he played the child in the T.) is masterfully inarticulate (he must be a man of few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. And miraculously (since we are talking about a Hollywood product here), a baby serves as the main character, but one who does not act or has lines, but only IS (and is bright). It is interesting to note that the mysterious relationship of Thomas w. E.T. was the core of this film; while your connection w. the baby serves as the core of "A Good Baby." <br /> <br /> Then there's the music - oh, what a song !! Gillian Welch's songs are wonderful and the whole trail is beautiful country music. <br /> <br /> This movie is wonderfully atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
