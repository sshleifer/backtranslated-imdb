When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I have to say that of all the shows I've seen, this is the best of everything. I had to see this show, and that's what I really did. When I received the first volume of this program, it was the best. I really enjoyed the animation, and all the fighting scenes were awesome. I have to say that my favorite characters on the show were Saber, Archer and of course I also like Illya. And of course, all the episodes in the volumes were interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers and others) playing the voice of Berserker. He has a cool character. And I even watched the entire series again before watching the final volume. So if you see something good, then watch this show, it's the best.
