Surprisingly well done for an independent film, An Nightmare Insomniac paints an amazing picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully well written and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream while the viewer is taken through a night in the life of an insomniac. Starring Dominic Monaghan as Jack, we can see everything he sees As the long hours of a lonely night drag on. The narration is almost hypnotizing and, from the opening lines, it is impossible to depart. Fascinating and slightly disturbing, it shows how one deals with lack of sleep, balancing between sanity and madness. <br /> <br /> With twists around every corner, Insomniac's An Nightmare is provocative and engaging. This is highly recommended.
