I've never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett ... until now. She was truly amazing in this movie. The emotion she must have gone through filming repetition after repetition does not take into consideration. This was a very difficult movie to watch, the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so powerless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like forever. I really felt that the whole thing was emptied when his friends returned home and I did not find the conclusion plausible. The director seemed very interested in using height in his shots and loved to use mirror reflections, I think he should have paid more attention to the rhythm in the second half of this piece. I'm sure this does a powerful piece of theater, this movie for me, although it had merit, ended up falling short.
