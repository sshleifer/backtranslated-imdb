I originally bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, hey! another movie starring Aishu and Shah Rukh, little did I know that Aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the movie in a song she shares with SRK and helps introduce her character who is in the movie for only 15 minutes. Shakti is a film about the love and endurance of a mother. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, maturing, entering into knowledge and embracing the harsh realities of life. The number of the item on which SRK and Aishu appear has nothing to do with the movie. In fact, it is a dream sequence that occurs while the drunk character of SRK is unconscious by drink. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at her favorite place one day, dressed in little clothes and begins to seduce him. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (loosely translated as "Love is a bitch!") And it's just smoking hot! Do not miss it.
