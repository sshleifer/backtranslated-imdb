When we started watching this series on cable, I had no idea how addictive it would be. Even when you hate a character, you retract because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation the way they do. It's almost as if the viewer is going through one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Adriana would endure Christopher's abuse with her, verbally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read the paper to see how many women can tolerate this behavior. Carmella has a dream home, an endless supply of expensive things, but I'm sure she would give up a loving, faithful husband - or maybe not. That's why I watch. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you watch an episode, you may find something that you missed in the first five times. We even watched episodes out of sequence (watch the first season of dawn with commercials, but the whole language, A & E with censored language, reruns on the Movie Network) - whenever we are, we are there. We're totally spoiled now. <br /> <br /> I also love the Malaprop's. "An albacore around my neck" is my favorite of Johnny Boy. When these jewels enter our familiar vocabulary, it's a sign that I should have a life. When the series is over, I will gather all the DVDs and put the collection in my will.
