In 2151 in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer fired Klingon Klaang with his plasma rifle after a methane shop exploded on his farm and Klingon was sent to Starfleet Hospital. Vulcan ambassador Soval proposes to turn off the life support system and bring Klaang's corpse to his warrior empire on the planet Kronos with honor. However, Captain Jonathan Archer proposes to go with the Enterprise on his first trip and bring Klaang back to his home planet. Jonathan invites Ensign Hoshi Sato and Phlox, who are treating Klaang to complete his crew, and Subcomandant Vulcan T'Pol is assigned to participate in the Enterprise's perilous first mission. When the ship's equipment is turned off, Klaang is kidnapped by Sulibans after a shootout at the hospital. After the autopsy of the Suliban killed in the shooting, Captain Archer is informed by Dr. Phlox that the alien was in fact a mutant, altered in a sophisticated genetic engineering process. T'Pol modifies the sensors of the Enterprise to track down the Suliban spacecraft until it reaches the planet Riger X. They investigate and disclose that Klaang was a messenger, bringing an important message about Suliban Sarin's Temporary Cold War to the leaders of the Klingons. in Kronos. <br /> <br /> Despite being a big fan of Star Trek, I did not follow the episodes of "Enterprise" on cable television. I decided to buy the DVD box of First Season and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first Enterprise, Captain Jonathan Archer, beautiful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip is excellent, at least in this pilot. I have noticed in IMDb that this episode is actually split into two parts, but on DVD they are only one, so my comment is valid for both. I did not like the score, which I found very annoying, but this was an exception in this great show. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
