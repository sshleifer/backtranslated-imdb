I thought this movie was a lot of fun. I watched this movie with my wife before having my first child. So I was not watching as family entertainment simply and I still enjoyed it. It seems that many of the reviews point out that this film is not destroying the Earth, there were no unexpected changes in the plot and that the film was predictable and annoying. If these people watched this movie hoping to have a religious experience doing it, they would obviously be disappointed. This is simply an animated film; just it. If you want to see this movie simply to sit and have fun, you will not be disappointed. In closing, this is definitely not the best movie that Disney did, but it's fun and I do not understand the bad reputation he got.
