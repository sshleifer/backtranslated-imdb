Having achieved his first fame with Drunken Master, Jackie Chan returned to the limelight with Project A of 1983, an extremely nice pirate film that re-established him as a great star. By the time Police Story was released two years later, the extraordinary hype surrounding Jackie was peaking, and crowds thronged to see this frenzied mix of incredible acrobatics, brutal fighting scenes, and questionable comedies. It broke several box office records and inspired a 50% increase in police recruits, but seen 20 years later - is it good? As an action movie, the Police Story unquestionably rises. There are several fantastic fighting scenes, some acrobatics reminiscent of the best of Chan's hero, Buster Keaton, and a compelling yet violent climactic dispute. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and as frequent inroads into the worked comedy dull the film's impact a little, his charisma drives him forward. Moreover, in presenting our hero as a frontier psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger, Jackie made an important bet ... although in case no one seems to have noticed! In praising the Police Story as a simple "Good vs. Evil" battle, critics disparaged the tone ambiguity of the film, and while it was difficult for Brothers Karamazov to portray such uncertainty, it was a remarkable and commendable change in conventional ideas. In short, this movie remains a quality movie "popcorn" (although you can empty your stomach as several villains are thrown into glass windows at the final scene of the movie) - a powerful action movie it is rated with the best of its period.
