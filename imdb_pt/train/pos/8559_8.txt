There is a certain genius behind this movie. I was laughing everywhere. The scene in the office of sex on the phone, discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a good attempt of this genius / humor. The execution is bad, but you can see the writer's message and they have some talent. The doppelganger division in the end was like ... "okay, it was not well expected, but let's see what the movie has to say." Certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and really very consistent with the story in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Is the goal of a film being to be logical or to be fun or to communicate on an emotional level? I'm easily bored with many movies, but this has always kept my interest. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have some self-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. Horribly bad, but good. I'm looking for other movies that this person might have done (with more experience).
