"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This tremendously entertaining movie grabs you from the opening scene and never ceases to deliver unexpectedly touching laughter, surprises and moments. I had more fun watching "The Matador" than almost any other 2005 movie. It's a crazy movie with an unforgettable character, played perfectly by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a hit-man who specializes in cutting-edge corporate shows (murdering wealthy guys). He is also experiencing something resembling a midlife crisis. After realizing that he has no real friends, no permanent home, no planned future, he stumbles upon a Mexican hotel bar one night and meets Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Danny is a resident A family man who is about to lose the big deal that can change things for him. He loves his wife very much, especially since they lost their young son a few years before. <br /> <br /> The two men are chalk and cheese, hardly any other common ground apart from being in the same desolate bar. night. And somehow, a conversation is waged, which sets in motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship they form reminded me a lot of Laurel and Hardy. One is the straight man and the other is the persistent idiot who puts them in trouble. The interaction is superbly timed and tuned, due in large part to the wonderful performances of Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But make no mistake ... This is the Brosnan movie. It prints one of the most memorable and contemptuously pleasing characters of the decade. He could shoot his mother and apologize immediately after that and you would probably forgive him. Brosnan may be the best movie charm, but this is his most captivating and complete performance to date. I would not be averse to seeing an Oscar for this role. <br /> <br /> Consider a scene where he ostensibly daring a high school girl with the most impure thoughts and utters the phrase: "All colored, blushy.There is no sucky fift". He does this with Bond's familiar smile and manages to escape unpunished. He can tell a boy, "Tell your mother to lose 30 pounds and 20 years, then come back to me," without appearing so unpleasant. In fact, it makes us like it even more. <br /> <br /> And yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly moving scenes, most of which come to an end when the film takes unpredictable turns. However, when Julian uses his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) console each other in their bedroom one night, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> "The Matador" is elegant and energetic. It's constantly fun. And it contains a defining role of careers for Brosnan as the lonely man who seeks normality, friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life. This is a neglected gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler from IndependentCritics.com
