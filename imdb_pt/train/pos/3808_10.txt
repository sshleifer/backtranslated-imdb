I voted it 10 out of 10 simply because it's the best animated story I could see in awhile. The animation is impressive. The work of art behind every landscape was beautiful. From colors to lighting, to the standard not typical of art. I was amazed. Moving beyond the beauty on the screen, you are immersed in a plot that is both timeless and cool at the same time. The character development is brief, but these key moments are exactly what is needed to tell the viewer what and why and how the character got to where they are. I am impressed with the whole affair and I think this is a must see for the whole family.
