This film should be seen for all librarians or librarian candidates. All the best lines are directly related to librarianship. The argument of the public library versus academic library is a classic argument caught between librarians and students of school libraries. It also breaks many librarian stereotypes. Librarians may even be able to have fun - even if they do not * normally * have sex in the romantic language section! (The best movie about librarians? Desk Set, with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, of course).
