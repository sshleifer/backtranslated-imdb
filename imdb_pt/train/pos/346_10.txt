What an incredible movie! It was very scary, great acting, well written, interesting twists, interesting characters, very good direction and an amazing ending that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is a popcorn horror movie that may not be appealing to non-horror fans, but still (yet) it's one of the best thrillers out there today! I recommend it only to fans of: 1) The horror genre <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or actress characterized by it. <br /> *** off the **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS- I'm sick of people comparing this, and other modern horror movies, with SCREAM. You know what, they do not want to be like the scream. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!" Well, if I'm not confusing, SCREAM also copied other movies too! In fact, almost all horror movies have copied an earlier one. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy what it is! <br /> <br /> GO AND RENT THIS! <br /> <br />
