Let's start by saying that the English title of this film "The Power of Kangwon Province" is an absolute misconception. It's because in the Hong Sang Soo movie, there are no real shots of wars, problems and conflicts. So the idea of ​​establishing the power of a province is neither adequate nor valid in the context of this film. If we were to judge this film by the title of the Korean language, "Kangwon-do ui it" will appear as an enigmatic statement about the emotional turbulence of its young protagonists. Minds are not at rest. Hong Sang Soo also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives. The people in question are a couple of young people who are constantly in the process of showing their moods, whims and fancies. If making a movie from scratch can be considered the meritorious virtue of a filmmaker, then Hong Sang Soo should be hailed as a courageous filmmaker whose films talk a lot about the omnipresent nothingness of human relationships, feelings and lives. Anyone like it or not This is the only fair conclusion to be drawn from this particular film.
