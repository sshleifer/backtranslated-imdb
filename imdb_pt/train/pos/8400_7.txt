I chose this movie at my local library. Having met the director at a film festival at the end of last year, I was curious to "check" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film gives a new look to family matters, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousies. It may be a bit "talkative" sometimes, but never so much as to completely sink the film. I enjoyed watching a love story with characters that CLEARLY belong and watching them make conscious decisions, rather than "accidentally dropping" into something as important as love. <br /> <br /> The contrast between this film and the low-budget average The film in black is quite distinct. Check out. If you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack just like mine. Good thing!
