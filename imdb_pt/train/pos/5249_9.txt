The choice of making this SNL dodge in a movie was much better thought than other recent ones. The mood involved in the character is not annoying humor, and is also directed to the character enough to be stretched for an hour or two. Strangely, sexual content seemed like it could be avoided, but that may be because the restrictions on live television taught me not to expect this. I suppose I was thinking more "Leisure Suit Larry" risqu√© than the producers were ... It's definitely not a PG-13 movie, which will probably hurt you from reaching the heights of your most successful predecessors, but even better premise and writing than the most discouraging. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but I doubt it's a big hit ... (which is sad, as Tim Meadows tends not to do characters that bothers me quite how often other SNL alumni tend to do)
