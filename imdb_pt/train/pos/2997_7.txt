William Powell is Philo Vance in "The Kennel Murder Case", a 1933 film also starring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show in which Philo got into his Scottish terrier Captain serves as the backdrop for a mystery of the locked room with many suspects. The mystery is very intelligent and the outcome is complicated and interesting. As the talkies are still fairly new, the camera work is a bit static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job of directing the action. <br /> <br /> The support cast is excellent; the whole cast raises the film. Many actors have played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played more (five times) and is the best fit for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. This was done before "The Thin Man" catapulted him to great stardom - he had spent about 12 years in the movies, starting his stage career in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable onscreen presence and a remarkable actor who lived to be almost 92. We are so lucky to have his films available on DVD and TCM today. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a great story and a fun movie - do not miss it.
