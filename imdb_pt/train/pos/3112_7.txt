I watched Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing it in the movies. I've been waiting for this since before they started filming. I was not dissapointed. <br /> <br /> Small spoilers below: <br /> <br /> Overall was good, but also lacked the continuity of the first two. Identity and supremacy flowed gracefully between the action of adrenaline and the introspective drama. This movie seemed agitated sometimes. The downtime of plot construction was slightly depleted. This caused the following action to feel very frantic. <br /> <br /> Camera: Speaking frantically, the trademark of Greengrass Shaped Cam was present and very irritating to me. I know I've been told / whined for nausea on the message board, but that does not mean it's not relevant. All the martial arts training that the actors went through was totally wasted. The ridiculous camera cuts and rocking camera ruined most of the fighting in the film. It's a cheap trick for the student director to make the film look unstable. I would expect these techniques to be used in horror films made for high school kids, but not in this adult action series. Very extreme close-up too. Make some framing. Take some interesting photos. Constant close-up seems lazy directing to me. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was very confusing at first. They put new names and faces in you from the beginning. It gave me the feeling that you arrive when you're late to the movie and you know you've lost some crucial information. He felt rushed or depressed for reasons of time. After catching up, the story is very good. It's nice to follow the leads along with Bourne. However, I did not mind the whole last scene of Supremacy (Landy / Bourne on the phone) being in the middle of the Ultimatum thing. This basically makes the film half-prequel. I thought it was strange. <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters: The movie's star is action. Obviously, only two originals remain. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. They getting together was kind of weird to me. I think they just wanted to give someone Bourne to protect and trust. Unless I have completely lost something, they do not even tell you why they came together. The other killers in the movie were very quiet. That looked like Gilroy / Greengrass / who wants to not leave open ends. Understandable, but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy. These scenes were phenomenal. These assassins are as unattractive as Castel (the first fella Bourne fights in Identity). The cast generally deteriorated over the course of the series. Clive Owen was practically a belated reflection. This is a measure of strength for the first cast. The second, they basically traded Chris Cooper for Joan Allen ... not exactly the same. This commercialises Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors to be nominated later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names that come to mind for this type of series. In addition to some pauses that seemed long, the performance was correct. <br /> <br /> As a whole, it was successful. It seemed that they wanted to end the series. If they had trimmed or rearranged the slower parts, completely eliminated Scott Glenn's part, zoomed out, and removed the victim's camera from the seizure, it would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER <br /> <br /> I do not see why they leave Bourne alive in the end. It was my understanding that this was the conclusion. They clearly made reference to the beginning of the series with their motionless floating silhouette. I thought it was going to be that. A kind of complete circle finalization. I liked Nicky reacting to the news. SPECIFIC SPECIFIC WARNING - FILM QUOTE BELOW - The last Bourne line at the end "Look at this ... Look at what they make you give". citing the first killer he killed, I loved it. The final scene was great. (Except that it was Vosen {Strathairn} who shot Bourne, why would he do that?) Just for revenge? If he was angry enough to kill, why not shoot Pamela Landy after she sends her secret file? .)
