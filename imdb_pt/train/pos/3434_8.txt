If Australian Post Office has always needed a promotional film for recruiting, then that's it. This is one of those movies whose heart is in the right place and you can watch it over and over again. Miranda's performance is touching, as it shows an aspect of Australia unimaginable to many Europeans, in that it can be cold, damp and gloomy, as anywhere else and as elsewhere the important thing is the people surrounding it. The characters in the film are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career change to an "office of dead letters" a thought to be considered. Miranda started making bigger movies, but I hope she always keeps an inner thought for this one.
