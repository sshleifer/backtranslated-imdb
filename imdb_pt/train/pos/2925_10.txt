during the Eddie Murphy show, a woman in the audience shouts at Eddie and a man from the audience responds. What is said is, women - DO MR ROB (this is a Saturday night live character), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH. unlike the previous post saying that women shouted, this is incorrect, although the post-er has said that he was there, they must have a hearing problem! despite what the post-er says about not being here on DVD, listen closely how you can actually hear it on DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope this helps someone curious out the blazing gas compliments !!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
