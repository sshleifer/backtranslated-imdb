First film by Reese Witherspooon. Loved it. The plot and acting were top notch. You are emotionally involved with the characters. In my opinion, it is necessary to see. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you'll see why Reese Witherspoon's career was so successful. <br /> <br /> The other cast members also do a great job. <br /> <br /> The film flows extremely well. There is not a dull moment in the whole picture. The length of Man on the Moon is correct. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I think this movie was excellent. I've seen it several times and enjoyed all the sights.
