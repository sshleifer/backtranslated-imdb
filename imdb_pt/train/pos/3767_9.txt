Go back to page ten of this review section and work back. Continues; I'll wait. <br /> <br /> Done? Well then you probably noticed the same trend I have. You could think all day about the jokes, dating the time and obviously the plot points derived and standing out in 'Bogus', but this movie seems to be one of those 'hate me now, love me later'. <br /> <Bill and Ted's biggest problem was that the original attracted those 80s boys who followed the trends and considered themselves at the forefront of fashion. This worked well for the original, but was obviously bombed in 1991 when none sloppy self-disrespect would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting that he liked anything from the 80s.

Here in 2010, those who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth are starting to look back and enjoy some of those crucial movies that (whether they like it or not) have made us who we are, if you're one of those who see 'Bogus' like a disdain ("Fa gs!"), then you're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair, wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed.
