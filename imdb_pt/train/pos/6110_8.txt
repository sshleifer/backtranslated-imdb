Like "My Sassy Girl," this movie is based on a true story posted on the internet, but that's where the similarities end. The story is usually about this rebel guy named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo) who is still trying to finish high school, whose parents hire a tutor named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman who comes from a poor background, but it happens the same age as him. Add to that a few obstacles, martial arts (thugs are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge), a sick and scornful girl who is after him, his propensity to abandon the lessons, and you can usually guess the whole story. Did I mention it's a romantic comedy? This film has good fighting scenes, great visual humor and a lot of courage, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which bring a lot of energy to the story. Romantic elements also work for this reason. And, I must say, I want a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from "My Sassy Girl" (personality, at least). She has some guts, but she's more cute, sweet, and kind-hearted. The characters are already very friendly (so you could say they had less of a hill to climb than "My Sassy Girl" - an obstacle that worked for the movie), and the film is pretty clever and interesting in most of the time. way. . The type of story sinks, however, in about 2/3 of the way (where it is a kind of familiar, standard, in which nothing really interesting happens), but near the end, it recovers a little. Overall a fun and cute movie. 8/10
