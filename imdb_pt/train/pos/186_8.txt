There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies could act, given the right property; she is wonderful in comedic roles. William Haines could act, and you can see why he was one of the most popular men on the screen. (Until a possible scandal forced him to leave the business). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit banal, but treated so well that you do not realize. The direction of King Vidor is one of the main reasons for this. The producer? The genius of the boy, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> It's about making movies, and you can see the process as it was done in 1928, the cameras, the sets, the directors and the engaging actors. You can see (briefly) some of the main stars of the day; even Charlie Chaplin does a turn like this, looking for an autograph. You also get glimpses of Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and many others who are just names and old photographs. <br /> <br /> Please, even if you are not a fan of silences, take this movie when you can. It really is a great time travel.
