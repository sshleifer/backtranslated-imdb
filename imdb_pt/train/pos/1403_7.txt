Paul Verhoeven (genius and master filmmaker) attacks with less than perfect, but still amusing in a "dirty old man type" Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the final act of the slasher disappoints. I'm still giving a recommendation for this movie for its special MIND BLOWING effects (maybe the best so far) and two dandy performances on the tracks. Verhoeven's moral questions are, of course, thought-provoking, and although the film has come to an end with many, this film is quite gentle to old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two major flaws: Josh Brolin (also known as ape-man walking) and the whole deal with the elevator. If there was an access ladder, why were they trapped in the lab? <br /> <br /> A fun horror movie for a Saturday night.
