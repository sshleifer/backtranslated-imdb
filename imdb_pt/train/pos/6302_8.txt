I went to see this as me and my lady had little else to do on a Sunday afternoon I like movies that deal with despicable characters, losers and this is full of em. After a slow start, we got some good plays from the cast, but it's the real "Bellini" that makes and leaves the movie down. The 'Bellini' is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a movie for a long time but it's very short and could have made it an overall masterpiece 71/2 out of 10
