When a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil master of darkness. If the ring ends in your hands, it will regain its power and destroy Middle-earth. Frodo and his loyal friends set out on a mission to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. This is an underestimated adaptation of the classic novels because it covers only the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation is done superbly with the rotoscope, which is being traced about live action scenes. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he received. The film also features a great soundtrack by Leonard Rosenman that fits in every scene. There are a few holes in the plot with the script, but this has to be excused, considering that the original agreement was to turn the trilogy of books into two films, many had to cram in the first. My biggest complaint is the character design, Samwise was a little silly, while the other hobbits act completely normal. The other characters are really well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a great job, I was pleased that Legolas is actually a bit more useful for the plot. Rotocoped Orcs are more comical than scary, while Ring Specters are strange and terrifying. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the evil wizard Saruman is called Aruman thanks to the writers. Overall, I think a little more money and better writers would have done a lot of justice, but there's something charming about it. Ralph Bakshi made a valiant effort to make the screen adaptation of these classic stories. The film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by live action movies, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
