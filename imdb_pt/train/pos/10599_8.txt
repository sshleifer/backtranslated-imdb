SPOILERS Many different comedy series nowadays, at one time or another, have experienced the idea of ​​obscure independence. In one of the first episodes of the animated cartoon "Family Guy," the Griffin family discovered that their home is an independent nation for the United States of America and that story progresses from there. In 1949, however, the Ealing Studios produced a wonderful little film at the same time. After the play of a child, the residents of Pimlico discover a small fortune in a treasure. In the survey, it is clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long-lost state of Burgundy. Leaving London and the rest of Britain, the residents of the small street experience the joys and problems of being an independent state. <br /> <br /> Based on a time when rationing was still in operation, this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring. Featuring performances by Stanley Holloway, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and a young Charles Hawtrey, the film is well stocked with some of the best actors of its generation. These actors are also well assisted by a great little script with a few broken lines. Feeling remarkably fresh, despite being over 50, the story never seems strange and always keeps the audience entertained. <br /> <br /> Ealing Studios was one of the best exporters of British films ever. With films like "Passport to Pimlico" it is not difficult to understand why. Fun from beginning to end, the story is always fun and always worth watching.
