I watched this movie in the joy of the shire. <br /> <br /> This is possibly one of the best films of all time. It has a timeless value, you can get so much of it that is amazing. There are parts that are moving, funny and just great. <br /> <br /> All aspects are in the same, the picture of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% genuine, even Irish subtleties have been covered. <br /> <br /> The use of high and low shots gives two great visions about Cristy (look at this). <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is incredible. I've never seen an actor do this, ever. It's really amazing. <br /> <br /> And it's so good to watch, it flows so well that it's probably the closest thing you can get from real life experience. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, you should see it. Make no mistake, there is something for everyone.
