This is a fine example of a rather simple Film Noir story that is handled exceptionally well - thanks to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger as well as some lovely acting performances. Dana Andrews stars as a hothead detective who often uses her fists instead of her brains. Soon after the film begins, Andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues, he will be out of the force. A little while later, while investigating a crime, he was attacked by a suspect and Andrews is forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does not use excessive force, but the assailant is dead. Andrews panics and assumes that they will not believe him, so he tries to cover up death - although instead an innocent man is guilty of the crime. <br /> <br /> There's so much more in the movie than that. -including a plot involving a slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). All in all, this is one of the best examples of the genre - with great bold dialogue, superb lighting and a simple but very effective story. This is how Noir should be.
