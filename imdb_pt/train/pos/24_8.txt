Although this is obviously a low budget production, it is worth seeing the performances and the songs from this film. One of the few musical roles of Walken to this day. (he's a wonderful dancer and singer and he also demonstrates his acrobatic skills - see the flagship!) Also starring Jason Connery. A great children's story and very friendly characters.
