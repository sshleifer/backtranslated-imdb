Post-feminist representation of cruelty and sadism. <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! <br /> <br /> This underrated gem of a movie tells the story of Flavia, a fifteenth-century girl from the birth of Nobles, surrounded by a convent, after defining her father and all medieval Christian society upon seeing a warrior Islam as a human figure rather than demonic. <br /> <br /> Unable to accept the convent's patriarchal government (explicitly stated in a scene in which the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks) Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and, by intruding in a whole system of subjugation, repression, and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to itself but to all those around it. Announced as a piece of nunsploitation, this is far from the truth. This is a film that describes the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal rule, the nature of rebellion, and the corruption of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> I described this in the title of this piece as "post-feminist." and in the end, Flavia's triumphs must always be corrupted, compromised, and perverted by men. Even the terrible end of Flavia is perpetrated by men to men. (The women move away and only the monks look without horror.) <br /> <br /> The much discussed violence is a representation of the effects of violence and violence the horrors of a world crazed by religious excess. To avoid violence would have limited the impact of the film, would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the patriarchal discourse that it is exposing.In addition, it is a realistic portrait Wonderfully filmed, brilliantly portrayed (notably by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares), containing a wonderful soundtrack by Piovani and still challenging after all these years, Flavia is a classic of European cinema.
