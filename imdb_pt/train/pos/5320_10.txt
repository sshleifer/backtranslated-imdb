I started watching this movie expecting nothing, just another movie to watch, but from the first twenty minutes, the masterpiece and artwork, which is puzzling, does not talk much, really got me in this movie. <br /> I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully rendered and really touching. It's a little slow, but the immersion was complete. The direction was incredible, letting us know, little by little, the story that led to Joey's conviction and his life behind the bars. The music was great and very well incorporated into the scenes. The ending was unexpected with a twist I did not see coming. It's not the kind of movie we see often.
