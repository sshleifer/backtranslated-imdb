Although the film is clearly dated, the public can still easily identify with the unfortunate Buster's plight in this timeless and timely tale. Buster fights against unkind adversities in three different ages: the Stone Age, the Roman Age, and the Moden Age, playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different "ages." In this film we see one of the earliest comic representations of the stereotype "cave man," who gains his love not by romance but by brute force, as well as by a funny twist in the combat of Roman gladiators, two comic sketches that have long been as similar as Mel Brooks' "World History: Part I". The underlying theme of the film is simple but convincing: although times may have changed, we still face the same struggles, even in modern times, where we struggle in prehistoric times to "win the girl" (remember this is the American theme of 1923, a time when chauvinism was still in vogue). It's interesting to look at this film more than eighty years later, and consider how things have changed dramatically from the "modern times" of this movie for now.
