The biggest surprise in this film was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing the stereotypical and loquacious roles she usually does, she plays an intelligent, intelligent, and tired character in the world. She does not have a big role, but she does a great job portraying Lois Harlan as a tired, though accustomed, woman covering up her boss's indiscretions.
