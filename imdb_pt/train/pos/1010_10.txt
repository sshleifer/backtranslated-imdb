I love this show! <br /> <br /> Every time I watch an episode, I repeat that phrase and I remember how good it is. I am a big fan of science fiction and this show has reasons to be the most important science fiction show in the history of cinema / TV. There are so many theories in this show about the universe that I could start a religion. It's amazing, season after season the show gets better and better. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 years old (19 years old) and I find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows all star Richard Dean Anderson. It's also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other. <br /> <br /> Back when I first saw Stargate in the movie, I immediately enjoyed it and considered it one of my favorite science fiction films, so I heard one. The TV show would work out, I got really excited, but I did not have time to show until the fifth season was almost over. <br /> <br /> Although, I was disappointed to learn that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to do a movie trilogy, but the studio opted for the series. <br /> <br /> I'd say it was all right. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is incredible, and I hope it never dies. Atlantis, here we go!
