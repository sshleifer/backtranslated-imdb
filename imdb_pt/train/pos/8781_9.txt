I consider myself a little connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling "Gentleman Jim" the best boxing movie ever made. This is Robert Wise / Paul Newman's "Somebody Up There Likes Me" movie. This movie may be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is a number close to 2. <br /> <br /> The film not only tells the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing in a moment of the transition. By the end of the nineteenth century, boxing was moving away from the brutal days of disobedient rules to the more "chivalrous" days of the Marquess of Queensbury's gloved rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and a time of acceptance and respectability. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not a realistic look for those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit cheesy at times. But always deliciously it. Errol Flynn is perfect as the "Gentleman" Jim, who really is not a "gentleman" at all, but just a quick talker of a working-class family. Alexis Smith is quite overwhelming as the upper-class woman with whom he has a love / hate relationship (and we all know that it is, of course, the love that will win this fight in the end). <br /> <br /> The end of "Gentleman Jim," the great John L Sullivan (whose famous phrase was NOT "I can lick any man in the world", of course ... romanticism again) passes the belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports movement ever made. Realist? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism, watch "Raging Bull." This is a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Gentleman Jim" is a lot more fun.
