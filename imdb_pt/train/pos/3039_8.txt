Frank McCarthy, who produced the Oscar-winning biopic, Patton, follows with a strong tribute to another of America's combat generals, Douglas MacArthur. Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of man, his genius and his selfishness. With MacArthur you never knew where one started and the other stopped and many times they mingled. <br /> <br /> The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six-hour film or a TV miniseries. That would cover him from his days at border crossings with his family until his time at West Point, where he still has the highest schooling ever achieved by a cadet. He would speak about his service in the Philippines as a young officer, his legend building bravery on the battlefields of World War I in France. He would also have to tell him about throwing the bonus marathons of World War I veterans in 1932, probably putting the last kabosh on any chance that President Herbert Hoover would have to be re-elected. During MacArthur's last years, he and Hoover had suites on the roof of the Waldorf Astoria in New York. This must have been an issue they avoided. <br /> <br /> This film focuses on the years 1941 to 1952 and is counted in flashback. The film begins with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962. As he speaks the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech, MacArthur's mind dates back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the Japanese advancing on the island of Corregidor and the Bataan fields in Luzon. The film takes him through his struggle to reconquer the Philippines, the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months, culminating in his relief from command by President Truman. MacArthur as a movie would not work if it was not the portraits of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, respectively. It's the part of the movie that I liked the most, seeing MacArthur and his relationships with these two men. O'Herlihy's FDR captures the aristocratic squire and the exceptionally torturous man who was our 32nd president. Roosevelt was a man who showed his points with unusual subtlety and cleverness. At times he liked to plan a little too much for his own good, but he was the political master of the last century. Note how he deals with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and as a potential rival at the same time. <br /> <br /> Truman of Flanders is how people remember him, a man who spoke of people who did not like MacArthur's haughtiness of gitgo. Of course it is in the history books that Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 by insubordination. MacArthur was insubordinate, no doubt. <br /> <br /> However, I could write a complete thesis on the relations between Truman and MacArthur. Along the way, you need never have come to a crisis. I always felt that FDR would have dealt with the matter a lot better if he was still president at the time. MacArthur was also grandly eloquent, and Gregory Peck captures some of this eloquence in some of the prayers that made him both a legend and victories on the battlefield. Listen to Peck in the Japanese surrender, MacArthur's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress, and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962. Watch the news and see if you disagree.
