Although not seen in many previous films, you have certainly seen the basic themes of the plot in many films since then. <br /> <br /> It's not one of Grant's best films or Loy's, they make a great effort together. After all, with so much talent and very good supporting cast, you know the laughter will be there. <br /> <br /> The film is light, has some dramatic blemishes but keeps the plot moving and makes you smile all the time. <br /> <br /> A great example of classic American film that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Definite fare on Saturday afternoon, heavy on popcorn.
