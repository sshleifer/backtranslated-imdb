"Match Point" and now "Scoop" have convinced me that Woody Allen is not only doing a great job making films in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the right cast member), but corroborating what I've known for years: he should do not focus on rich and neurotic New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays the journalism student Sondra Pransky, whom the magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in his vanishing box, where she meets the ghost of the murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who says the serial killings that tormented London were committed by millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Then she gets to know him and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell her without giving up. But I can say that this is probably Allen's funniest film in years. There is his unique and ubiquitous style of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> So, you're certainly going to like this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But mostly, it's so hilarious. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you have to love this one.
