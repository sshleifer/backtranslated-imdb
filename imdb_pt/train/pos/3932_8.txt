In the same melody of his American Drums Along the Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a way that is fictitious but very believable. Henry Fonda has made three consecutive films at this time with Ford and all three are about a certain time and place with an emphasis on scenery and the cultural environment. In Mohawk, pioneering America is in full bloom with Americans defending themselves against Indians and other forces. Here, Ford shows us America of the nineteenth century; a time when invention and creativity were beginning to flourish and this nation was really becoming great. Among all this was a tall, thin Illinois lawyer named Abe Lincoln and this film fictionalized his life as a lawyer, foretelling the greatness he would later accomplish. Fonda is superb in this film, capturing the essence of what is considered the persona of Lincoln, though no one knows exactly how he was at that time. The support sets and casts also work well together and give a unique balance in the quaint Ford of the American dream and its many forms. This is not a film to be taken literally, but symbolically, showing that Lincoln was in fact preparing for the events of his life that would create his legacy. We even have some scenes between him and a young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they ended up together, but that's not the point. I believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, widely regarded as the greatest American president. His calm and direct demeanor was rare at that time and would be today. In fact, our government certainly needs more men like it.
