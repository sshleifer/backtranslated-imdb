You know, Robin Williams, God bless you, you've been stepping on your feet lately with all those silly comedies he's done in this decade (with perhaps the exception of "Death To Smoochy," which he bombed when he left but is now a classic cult ). The dramas he's done lately have been fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener", despite mediocre comments and a quick release on DVD, is among his best work period. <br /> <br /> This is a very creepy story, even if it does not include a serial killer or someone physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on a real case of fraud that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography of a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuses and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read online reports that Johnson may not exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams portrayed so brilliantly resurfaced in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette probably gives him the best dramatic performance as well as the sociopath "caretaker." Her role was a far cry from those she had in films like "Little Miss Sunshine." There were even times she looked at the camera where I thought she was looking directly at me. It takes a good actress to play this kind of role, and it's that discrete (well-reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation that was not even nominated for an Oscar (in 2008). . It is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world that is so, and it is scary too. <br /> <br /> This is a good dark movie that I recommend. Be prepared to be uncertain, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling in the end.
