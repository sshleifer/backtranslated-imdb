"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" .. as above so below .. that very special point where the Divine and the Human meet. I love this movie! A jewel. YES, incredible grace! <br /> <br /> I was so deeply moved by your HUMAN quality. I laughed and cried for a whole record, actually several octaves of emotions. <br /> <br /> Mikael Nyqvist is brilliant as Daniel, a passionate first-class, charismatic and powerful performance. Its inner light and exceptional talent shine through every scene, every interaction, every meeting. I was totally hypnotized, enchanted and caught up in history, which is our collective history, the story of life itself. <br /> <br /> The film was also so inclusive of many archetypes, messiahs, wounded children, magical child, artist, teacher, priest, abuser, abused, victim, bully, divine fool - ALL the characters so real and faithful to life - all aroused great affection and compassion in me. <br /> <br /> It's a real treat to watch such a fun and entertaining movie. Oh ... do not forget the heavenly choir of the angels and the breathtaking sound. <br /> <br /> THANK YOU ALL - This Swedish movie will surely captivate people all over the world. BRIGHT!
