This movie changed everything for me ... I heard about breakdancing and hiphop, but I had never seen it done professionally (hey, I was an 11 year old boy from Holland!) When I saw this movie, everything changed. I got actively involved in the hiphop movement in our city, started dancing and writing lyrics. <br /> <br /> Until today, I still consider this film a personal favorite. Of course, filming and the "cinematic" importance may not be as significant. But who cares if the movie was filmed poorly or if you can see a microphone hanging above someone? It's what makes you, personally, that counts ...
