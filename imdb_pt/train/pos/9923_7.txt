I read several mixed reviews and several of them simply destroyed the movie. I originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by Tony Scott and I became very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a profound impact on me. Before I begin my analysis, let me first say this ... It is wonderful to see that this film could have been told in a boring and ordinary way, but the writers and Scott chose a different approach. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> Simply stated, it is not annoying. Most Hollywood movies feature 'tried and true' scenarios that they know will connect with people, often ensuring the film's acceptance of the film and creating a greater likelihood of profit. This plot was one of the most interesting I had seen in a while. Just for reference, I recently watched 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and while I'm going to say that these films are great, and I enjoyed them tremendously, both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect that they be numbered. They do not take risks and are extremely predictable after you've watched a good amount of American movies. The Domino plot is interesting and told in a way that keeps you thinking, "Oh man, they're screwed now." And I feel like I've been missing out on a lot of recent movies. It has a lot of depth, in my opinion, and it gives you many things to question while you watch. Overall, that's what got me so interested in the movie. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt the characters were accurate. Knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman who was nothing on the inside and wanted to be seen as she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself, and she used every means she could to get it. Choco was also very credible, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to Domino's lack of affection, as well as his problems of jealousy within the team ... they all sounded real to me, which made me feel that his character was much more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still sounded true to me. He looked like an ordinary guy trying to survive. I hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to do with him, because that's what I got out of it. He did a very good job at showing Ed a common Joe way that made mistakes, but he's still trying to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe they provided the heart needed. 'for history. They were not just people who were making money to buy a Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem and were looking for other ways to achieve that goal. You could empathize with them because, to them, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. These characters should show real people who are less fortunate that they got into this mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> The Mafiosi: They made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can. And I really enjoyed that part. They also filled the story with little details that made the plot much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 men: <br /> <br /> They provided comic relief in a very serious film. From Walken's clumsy statements to the incessant references to the 90210 guys who are bumblebees. Their involvement in the film only made it much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Photography ... yes .... cinematography. This is where this movie seems to have lost many potential fans. But in my opinion I thought it was cool, using the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. I considered a method that was performed correctly, but could always use improvements like anything else. I applaud and congratulate Scott, the editor, the cinematographer and the cinematographer for having some real chances with this film. Not only were they far and above with their presentation, they went much further. The use of extremely light and extremely dark colors provided the "look" of the film with a sinister and grubby look that accurately portrays the lives of peasants, bounty hunters, and the less fortunate in a way that shows that their life is not As peach or 'clean' as everyone else. If you realize, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks, if any. This shows that Scott and his team were trying to get something with that look and they were not just doing it. I realize that most people who watched this movie were not expecting it, and that caused a lot of them to be turned off for this movie, but I think it's great that Scott took that approach. Hollywood movies have become predictable and bland. Most of them are filmed in the same way with the same twists and turns. And I'm glad Scott tried to do something different. <br /> <br /> Granted, this movie is not for everyone, but to say it's rubbish and has nothing to offer is completely missing from the point. I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I spent the money for it. I would recommend this to everyone, but I'm sure it will only hit a chord with a few. I must agree to an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'MTV sphere' will not appreciate this movie, but I think a lot of people will like it. We should all try to take advantage of the fact that Scott and co. risked and tried to deliver something different and unique. And with that in mind, I think he succeeded tremendously.
