First I liked this movie. It was well interpreted by all. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the comments I have heard from people about an amazing ending. I did not know anything about this movie except for a few "must see" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was going in less than ten minutes. (I will not mention what you told me not to spoil a good movie for others.) Still, though it sounds obvious, I kept watching. It was good to see how it all unfolded, filling in the details and motivations of the character in later scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not hate when I think the ending at the beginning of a movie. I only hate it when the way to resolution is full of a boring scenario. <br /> <br /> Will Smith's screen character is simply nice, even when he's playing such a troublesome character. He's energetic and believable in everything I've seen him do. Seven pounds is another good performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid artist, portraying a quirky character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you do not find it beautiful, you must think of replacing your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was cool to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I have not seen him much lately, but this could just be me. Woody did not have a huge amount of time on screen, but he sold his blind character, piano and piano for all that paid off. Great. <br /> <br /> A little research on the box of jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I think this makes it a questionable choice for both the animal and the plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to recommend this movie not for plotting, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions we usually try to avoid.
