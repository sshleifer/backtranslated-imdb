and this is a very disturbing film. I may be wrong, but this is the last film in which I considered Burt Reynolds a real actor, who turned the role, and delivered a message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are excellent too. They are unpretentious and unconscious; businessmen who want to enjoy the country. Little did they know what would happen next. <br /> <br /> The photography and the scenery are realistic and natural. That was before the days of Wes Craven. <br /> <br /> What is most disturbing in this movie is the fact that places like this still exist. In America, the peasants still hate the people of the city; is almost a century and a half since the Civil War. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was filmed in the rural sections of South Georgia, which still exist. Just do not go through that to Mobile, Alabama; This area has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
