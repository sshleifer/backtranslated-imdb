When I was very young, at a local TV station, they showed kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays. I watched a lot of Kung Fu movies on weekends. I remembered many of them. I've seen great movies like Crippled Masters, Blind Fist. Bruce, Kung Fu Zumbi, Drunken Monster of Shaolin, Rabbi of the Master, Dragon of Tattoos and ... Five Deadly Poisons. I remember the day clearly. Me and my dad just ate lunch at Burger King. see the movie that would be this Saturday. We ran home and jumped on the couch, turned on the set and threw it in 56. The usual introduction of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday on it. Then under the title of the film.He said five deadly poisons.Then the movie began.I bit my fun burger with the pre-credit sequence.I loved this movie the minute it came.My favorite character was Poison of frog. The plot was difficult to follow at this age, but that was not what attracted me ... it was the fight. The fights were so ... awesome I moaned every time a commercial came and soon the 2 hours of the best movie I've ever seen ended.
