Surprising ..... This may have been a poor attempt to redo the already re-created Omen Movie, but I sure liked it. <br /> <br /> That last man who commented is a fool, this movie was one of Kind, and Music Dark, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would have applauded this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend horror movies and soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this movie. So listen to what I have to say, not that other idiot. <br /> <br /> There's only one thing that does not fascinate me, the finals. <br /> <br /> According to Prophecy, it is all inaccurate, Including Final Conflict, and Left Behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is .... There are great movies ... and must be seen, before the Great Depression falls on us, and before the Democrats Take over the Presidency as well. <br /> <br /> Signed ... Jacob Eder ... A farmer, with an idealizer.
