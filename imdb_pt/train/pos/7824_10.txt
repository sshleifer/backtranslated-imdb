One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in jail. After the murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to carry Biko's message to the world. In "Cry Freedom," Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before he gets arrested. charges. When Woods attempts to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin to live under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene shows the police firing at the demonstrators. <br /> <br /> As one of the two films (along with "A World Apart") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, "Cry Freedom" stands out as possibly the best work of all involved.
