I do not doubt that the critics have criticized this film, especially the artistic fartsys who need a laxative. This is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot & Costello or more recently Don Knotts. It will not shake the world or change movies forever. What you're going to do is entertain. When all is said and done, it is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget about your problems. It still has a simple and gentle moral message at no extra cost. I always loved Elvira's TV show while living in Los Angeles. She did not really steal her Vampira cheater more than Vampira did with the original, Theda Bara. This type of mythical character belongs to the one who does the best; & Cassandra Peterson does the best. Viva Elvira; We need more movies like that. There is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. It exudes a wonderful refined malice. I did not find technical flaws. Execution is as close to perfection as the art form. My deepest compliments to the director, James Signorelli, and his entire team.
