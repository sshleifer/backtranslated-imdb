"Home Room," such as "Zero Day" and "Elephant," was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings. But unlike the other two films, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or the dead) in the aftermath of a shooting. Making it less exploratory and more useful because little effort is wasted on asking questions for which there are no answers. <br /> <br /> Do not give up on this little movie during the first 20 minutes, it should set the actual story, but plays as a "Hill Street Blues" episode rejected. It is lame, but bears at least enough running length to get the film ranked as a feature. I recommend skipping this completely and just jumping into hospital scenes - there's nothing here that you can not get from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like many good movies, this was creatively a one-man show as Paul F. Ryan was the writer and director. Although this arrangement does not guarantee a good movie, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in dramatic budget features. Because the script of "Home Room" is his real strength, it is fortunate that the writer also performed the production and ensured that his vision came to the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan has a great chance at the end that tests the tolerance of sentimentality of the average viewer. He runs to the edge, but against all logic leaves you crying instead of shrinking. Why the ending works is a combination of the public's need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, Sarah McLaughlin's song "Sweet Surrender," and the incredible last minute edition. <BR> <BR> The other force in the film is the cast of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as lead characters. Although Phillips plays his standard alien teenager and Christensen his intelligent daughter of a good family, both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What's happening here is all about the two, despite a paralyzed tale about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie Alicia to the lone shooter. If they ever cut and trim the film, that side story must be condensed. <br /> <br /> A story about two extremely disparate girls linking up and helping each other is hardly a new idea and Ryan could easily have directed that movie. in clich√© and predictability. But instead, their script makes them engage in a fascinating and compelling sparring match, slowly cutting off each other and sharing moments of vulnerability, only to retreat within themselves. Deanna's "I'm Dying Inside" line just separates it - I can not think of any other movie I ever felt so intensely. She desperately needs a connection that Alicia resists so desperately. Deanna only makes progress when she leaves. The spectator continues to expect the collective embrace that never seems to happen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this not only generates a lot of suspense, but leaves you wondering at the characters and the two actresses who brought them to life. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
