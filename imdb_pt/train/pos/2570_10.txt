Well, this is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and I love it so much that I memorized most of the screenplay (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks the wind) and even with the script on my I still I like to watch it for Jerry Lee, this German shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who is smarter. The slogan is also valid. Not to mention that acting is great, although Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper (check out the filmography on CSI if you do not know what I mean). It's a shame that this movie contained only the one problem with which Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work, it would have been cool to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had up their sleeve.
