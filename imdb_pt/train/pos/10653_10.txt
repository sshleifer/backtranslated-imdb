I know it's fashionable now to hate this movie. I've seen hundreds of suspense movies, including the original haunting of 1963, as well as most Hammer movies. This movie is not contained and does not hold everyone, which is probably the reason why so many modern viewers did not seem to like it. However, many viewers can accept control films like Scream, because knife killers are easier to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. In fact, this movie had a lot of great scenes and the special effects and acting were great. I've seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time. The director of this film made a series of interesting and stylish films and was not trying the kind of realism of the sixth sense. The Haunting lets go and it certainly is not boring. Maybe this movie might attract more John Carpenter fans, but more of a traditional storyline. Old Haunting was also a great 1963 film. It was even more scary. See the two and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
