Without a doubt, Private Lessons II is the biggest movie I've ever seen. A Japanese import (bad) translated into English, is a joy to watch. It does not make much sense, but it does not matter. It's the biggest comedy without ever being intentionally funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is rare and not available on video, but I caught it a few hours late, late at night on a cable paid. My recorded copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as I slowly, person to person, I introduce this movie gem to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays the tutor / lover of Ken, our hero. (She was apparently just working on her check). Ken is played by Goro Inagaki, from the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives his all and has great hair throughout the film. Stacy Edwards, of the fame of "In the Company of Men", also appears in the film and is probably happy to have found another film later. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three previews to find out what the plot is. By repeating the visualization, you can appreciate elements such as the abnormal amount of pots Ken has in his house (at least 50) or that Ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered corn husks at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable but highly quoted. My friends and I re-enact entire scenes. Yes, it seems we are losers and we are ... but we are losers who have seen "Private Lessons II". Be one of the ten people in the world who saw this movie. You'll thank me for it.
