'Presque rien' is a story of two young people in love during their summer stay by the sea. I do not want to tell the plot, because it's not the most important thing about this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this film is cinematography. The visual side of 'Presque rien' is so incredible it deserves a higher note. You are enchanted by its beauty. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is shown in an uneven and rather complicated way. There is no simple chronology or no answers to all the questions the movie brings. But that's what makes 'Presque rien' even more interesting. I recommend this movie to all people for whom the artistic side of the films is very important and they will not be disappointed.
