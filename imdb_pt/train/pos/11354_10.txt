CitizenX (1995) is the developing world's answer to the Silence of the Innocents. Where "Silence" terrified our peace of mind, "Citizen" exhausted us and made us sad. This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates very well, thanks to a Westernized friendship between two Rostov policemen who become equal. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also argue against (!) The death penalty far better than the life of Kevin Spacey. David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> Humans are Machiavellian mammals, under which are the limbic brains (logic of the lizards). Why were two children, who knew better, stoned to death a child they kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women shout 'li-lilililililii' in acts of terrorism OBSCENE? - My own term for this is "limbic domination," the logical-lizard impulse to dominate an "enemy." If you have the words "enemy" / "revenge" in your vocabulary, you are easily capable of "limbic domination". In the 1980s devastated by World War II, Rostov (located at the mouth of the River Don) near the Black Sea, nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilo's desire for "limbic domination" to subjugate his layers of civilization . The easy victims of Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) were poor, usually children, who were traveling by train on the interurban train, since they could not afford anything else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the denials of an unbridled Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such "lambs." Rostov's serial killer was released for almost seven years AFTER the police were arrested and released. <br /> <br /> The politicization of the fight against crime is damaging to police forces everywhere. Although policing routinely suffers from corruption around the world, in the West, politicians' vote can create rivalries between chronic agencies, preventing a more coordinated response to crime. In the Soviet Union of the Citizen, however, Viktor Burakov's Killer Department (Stephen Rea) was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychically inadequate Chikatilo with impeccable but underestimated authority. point of complete obscurity. In real life, too, Chikatilo had the experience of a lifetime blending and escaping capture. <br /> <br /> Its pursuer, on the other hand, stands out as a strange bird, given to naive and undisclosed blasts. Perhaps by design, Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensic chief Burakov. Rea's Russian accent is impenetrable; and his Burakov is humorless and moody, at odds with everyone. So it's Donald Sutherland who comes out with the photo. Col. Fezsov, of Sutherland, chief of Burakov and, at first, his only supporter, is an overly moderate and patient militiaman, whose dignified carriage witnesses decades of bureaucratic machinations. His awakening as a policeman driven by logic, but still in love, becomes the fundamental idealism of the film. Joss Ackland plays another role as an evil apparatchik, secretary of communist ideology Bondarchuk, overseeing the investigation. Of course, he repressed the arrest of the most likely suspect, a Communist, in 1984, a man carrying a rope and a knife in his purse, supposedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo. Soon, he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, Detective Gorbunov (John Wood), insisting that the investigation now focus on "known homosexuals." The funniest scene of this sad and sad movie comes during Bondarchuk and Gorbunov's institutionalized harassment: a stupid cop reports: 'As I suspected, comrade, it is fornication. I did some drawing - the howling laughter. <br /> <br /> 5 years after the bodies began to pile up in 1987, the police finally tried to request criminal profiles. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr. Aleksandr Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who named UNSUB `CitizenX '. Later he also noted to Fetisov and Burakov that "... together you are a wonderful person". We agree. <br /> <br /> The extended rhythm, spread over a decade, perfectly captures Glasnost's institutional inertia - "openness" -that did not happen. The contrast with Perestroika - "restructuring" - could not have been greater for the case. Although Chikatilo was still prowling the railway stations, police plans were about to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> In 1990, Colonel Fetisov was quickly promoted to General. His enemy Bondarchuk disappeared from the scene, allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference. Personal, communications, advertising - all of a sudden all were available. In just one night of phone calls, Fetisov got her forensic chief to have access to the FBI Serial Fact-Finding Task Force in Quantico, where, Fetisov discovered, employees are rotating serial killings to avoid just such psychological damage to investigators. Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensic chief, now Colonel Burakov, of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the dividing scene of the film's driving force. Fetisov is the most affectionate excuse I've ever seen in the movie: 'Particularly, I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife. I hope someday you can forgive me my ignorance, "he almost whispers. <br /> <br /> An HBO production, CitizenX is a movie of the highest caliber. Not only do the exteriors seem authentically gloomy (filmed exclusively in the most dilapidated parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but Randy Edelman's soundtrack is utterly overwhelming - and often our only relief from the brutal desolation. Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits. <br /> <br /> Chikatilo's actual murders are portrayed as a somber and aberrant behavior born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally gloomy world. This makes the murders seem not entirely out of place - but of course they were. As President Kennedy reminded us, "we all enjoy the future of our children." <br /> <br /> CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is much darker and obscene than any revenge fantasy could imply. Serial rapists rape to dominate; Serial killers kill to dominate. Then make some soldiers. Such 'limbic dominators' make poor humans. <br /> <br /> WARNING-SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- The real Andrei Chikatilo was the most prolific known serial killer in the world. Condemned, he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all death sentences in the Soviet Union: a shot, in the back of the head. Tolerably, such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best result is always the prevention of murders, not your accusation. Executions simply guarantee society's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims' deaths when we even send out evidence of HOW / WHY they died. The killers also do not regret being dead. <br /> <br /> Revenge does not destroy the victims. Pursuing the murderer's blood is nothing better than counter-domination - since it's too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge in the name of mourning is not justice for the deceased - it is appeasement of the living. / 10)
