When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends get together for movie night, there's a movie they insist on watching over and over again: you guessed it, K-911, the third installment of the successful star-studded K-9 franchise for all. father of TV favorite, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> Guys, I knew it was possible to use a VHS tape, but a DVD? This has been played so often that it is starting to jump; No joke! But of course you will have this when you have such a lovely, brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> Of course we have to thank the first and only Tom Hanks for introducing us to the beloved genre Cop-Dog. with Turner and Hooch; however, even this film does not match the sheer excellence displayed in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some negatives say that Belushi lost heart with this third movie in the series. Poppycock, I say. While you may suspect that a third installment - straight into the video, it may not seem like something worth watching, you'd be wrong to watch that quality movie. <br /> <br /> I will not donate the plot, but I will say that Belushi and his panting partner give their best performance so far - one that will make you laugh at such a laugh! It's a shame that John Belushi is not alive to see what big steps his brother has made in the world of actors. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend that your teenage daughter present this movie to her best friends at her next pajama party. Do not forget the dog chow!
