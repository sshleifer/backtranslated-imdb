Partly from perceived need, sit down, include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950s movie audience. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some perversely funny characterizations of bureaucrats high-ranking officials who run the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - the British are ridiculed in the way that only the British can ridicule. But after that, the movie loses its way on a conventional plot of farce. Terry-Thomas watches as usual, but the cast's great talent (Peter Sellers, et al) is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> A fun movie, but not great.
