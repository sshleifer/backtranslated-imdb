As the B movies go, it was well above average (I notice the reader now that I can reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, though I'm trying to minimize such a trend). As sequels usually happen, it was absolutely fantastic (although a cookie cutter approach attempted to copy certain elements of the original verbatum of the film.) Despite this sometimes tedious trend, it seemed to work in that particular movie as long as the viewer could divide his comparisons with the original Scanners). The film was similar in terms of the series "Superman," in terms of the description of the main character of his childhood and relationship with his parents. (who seemed modeled on the same lines as the Kents in "Superman" stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero possessing extraordinary powers from an early age, and so on. The description of deep feelings of alienation from prodigious or otherwise conforming children, teenagers and / or adults was a theme that reminded me of films like "Real Genius" and (in a more superficial degree) "Doctor Mordrid" and struck a particularly strong chord. <br /> <br /> The film had a positive message and it was fun to watch. I found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of representation of certain aspects of paranormal experiences) fascinating, and even playing deeply sometimes. These moments occasionally popped up among all the great, formula-driven, free-sex slobs (in this case, how the sexual elements were made with taste) and violence that makes B (or Shakespearean movies, incidentally!) Fun to watch ! <br /> <br /> This is a must-have watch for all comics, Sci-fi, "remote-viewing" enthusiasts and horror fans! With correct exposure in the right circles, the film can develop a great following along with the original Scanners.
