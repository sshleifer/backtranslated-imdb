24 has to be the best spy / adventure series the TV has ever shown. The idea of ​​telling a story in a 24-hour period in real time is dazzling. The style of filming and rhythm is what holds us to watch it. And Jack Bauer is one of the biggest characters in a TV series for a long time. I rate this, along with The Simpsons and X-Files, my three most favorite TV series. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate American Senator David Palmer, who is also running for president. Bauer is called to his office to find out who is behind all this and at the same time find his daughter's way into the unknown after running away from her room. So, an adventure begins in the best political style and, best of all, it always happens in real time, which makes this TV series a true work of originality at a time when almost every show on TV seems to be showing us the same things over and over again.
