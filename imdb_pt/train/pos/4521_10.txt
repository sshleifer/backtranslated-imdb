Julie Waters is always wonderful, but Adrian Pasdar is a positive revelation in this genre-distorted comedy about a transvestite who can not suppress his obsession and the changes he goes through when he is discovered. Infallibly avoids the vulgar and vulgar jokes of true intelligence and true insight, and has an absolute ball in doing so. A very good, discreet, feeling good, comedy
