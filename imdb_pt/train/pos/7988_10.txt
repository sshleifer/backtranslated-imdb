I get teased all the time by family and friends because of my tears during the movies, and they were not disappointed when I saw this movie. I cried several times but believe me it was not about friability. I craved the family and craved this man as he tried to redeem himself in the only way he knew. Denzel was fabulous, as always, and Chris Walkin too. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize it; the years were not kind to him. My husband is not one to watch movies again unless they are historically accurate war films (they snore !!!!) He's watched this movie 5 times now and I'm going to have to get the DVD to watch it again because he used it the tape and jumped the whole time I was watching.
