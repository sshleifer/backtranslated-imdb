At the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how stubborn he was while looking for a spoon. Meanwhile, the late Joe reveals the identity of London's serial killer of tarot cards. He fools the Reaper and appears to American journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is onstage in the middle of a magical show of the magical Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, and tells her that the killer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sid in his investigation, seeking evidence that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and asks if Joe Strombel is right in his shell. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another great Woody Allen comedy out of Manhattan, actually back in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic, and I laughed a lot with his fate as a hero in a country where people drive "on the wrong side". Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in excellent shape as a comedian. However, her current muse Scarlett Johansson, of whom I am a big fan, has an overdone performance and is irritating at many times, even changing her accent to a histrionic accent. His character is absolutely silly and promiscuous, and I was quite disappointed by his performance (probably for the first time in his filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and interesting entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop? The Big Hole" ("Scoop ?? O Big Scoop")
