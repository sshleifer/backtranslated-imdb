Perhaps the best book by Isabel Allende, House of the Spirits, describes an alternative Chilean story, is full of magic, a mystical veil, plus some kind of omnipresent sadness. This film brings together a great cast, plus a great art direction, with a script that can not contain all the quality of this book. It is unusual for a country almost unknown as Chile to be as well represented as it is for this film, whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high, and because of that, left the illiterate public a little annoyed, mainly because they understood very little.
