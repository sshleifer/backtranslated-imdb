This movie could have been a silent film; It certainly has the feel of one. I was extremely, extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this movie. Extasy, it's a "symphony of love" and transcends all language versions. French, which is the best romantic language, seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. A young Hedy Lamarr illuminates the screen, in this film that, in a way, is almost like a sexual fantasy; but definitely far from pornographic. The mechanical qualities may have been a little rude; but that does not detract from the magical spell that this movie exudes. Many early movie lovers would love this movie.
