The Night Listener is probably not one of the best roles of William, but he does a very interesting character in a somewhat strange but very different film. I can assure you that you've never seen this kind of movie before. Some people may not like the slow pace of this movie, but I think that's the big advantage of the movie. It's definitely one of the best movies that came out in the year 2006. It has an intriguing performance in a movie with great content, a dramatic feel. This is not an Americanized movie. Nor is it a predictable film. You just feel like it's a movie that has secrets that you have a hard time determining what the outcome of that might be. This is not a great movie that has it all, but hell, it's a very good and very original movie.
