I am a fan of ART, I like anything about Art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This movie shows, so I really like it, shows how a woman wants to paint anything about Art, especially naked bodies, but she can not do it because of her strict family (father) at the beginning of the film she painted herself naked , but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family did not let her paint naked men because it is against morality. Even so Artemisia could paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems that the art teacher is absolutely in love with her too, so in the end he sacrifices his freedom for her lying. He said he raped her, but it was not true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she says she's going to suffer a lot, because at the trial where Artemisia, her father and the art teacher were, someone was hurting her artistic hands to tell the truth. I think this is a great movie about ART and an artistic love. It's worth watching. Valentina Cervi is great as Artemisia, she acts very well, I also like her performance in "The Portrait of a Lady" as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
