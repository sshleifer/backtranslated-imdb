This is simply the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Bad acting, bad script, bad scene, bad costumes, bad camera and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself laughing. <br /> <br /> So, you will not win an Oscar, but if you've got beer and friends around, then you can not go wrong.
