The plot was rather interesting, but the characters were quite flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behaviors. More extreme than necessary. Also, I think something went wrong with the cast. John Turtorro really does not satisfy me by playing a semi-autistic chess player, let alone the Italian player. The motives were also not very delineated. <br /> <br />
