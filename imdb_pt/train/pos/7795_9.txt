This will be a different kind of review. I've seen this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter, which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I saw by Ashley Judd and she was great and I enjoyed all the other things I saw in her. The Sundance reaction also impressed me, as did the director, Victor Nunez, who directed and wrote several films about Florida. This movie talks to me and I did not see anything to compare. The plot speaks less to me than the environment. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.
