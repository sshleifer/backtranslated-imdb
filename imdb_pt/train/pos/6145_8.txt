Mary Poppins is definitely much better, but this is a lovely movie, however. Angela Lansbury is splendidly dotty as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has a lot of fun like Mr. Brown. His chemistry was simply brilliant too. The children, however, did not have the same brightness, although Paul is very funny and cute. The songs were not as bad as some people say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, actually all the songs are great. The special effects were wonderful, they had lots of magic and the story is original enough. The highlights, however, like Mary Poppins, were the animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was the football match, which was absolutely hilarious. The only other criticism was that I did not get to the end when I first saw it. All in all, a beautiful movie that is almost never connected. 8/10 Bethany Cox
