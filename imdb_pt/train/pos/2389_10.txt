I work with children from 0 ?? 6 years old and they all love Doodlebops. Doodlebops are energetic, vibrant and attractive. Once they begin to sing, "We are the Doodle Scribbles We are the Scribbles of the Tail We are the Scribbles of the Rabo Oh yeah Come and join the fun because we are laughing and singing all day" it is almost impossible not to join to them Doodlebops brings the viewer to a world of color and fun. Every show is an adventure, DoodleBops do not try to change the world with messages preached, all they do is have fun while meeting the challenges of everyday life that the little child Doodlebops is a refreshing, high-action alternative to regular children's TV shows.
