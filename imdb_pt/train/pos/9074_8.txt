The show is very funny. Nice theme. Jokes and a lining are really good. With little extra adjustment, it can become a very popular program. But the only major negative point of this show is the cast. David Spade does a great job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But who the hell threw Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich? Technically, Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the program, which makes viewers want to watch the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated family man. The relationship ... with an experience of all the problems that a couple faces in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - does a horrible job like Jeff, he's not at all fit for the role. He's like a robot, literally there's no punch in his delivery of dialogue. <br /> <br /> The cast is really very important for the viewers to like. The bad acting will surely take the show down ...
