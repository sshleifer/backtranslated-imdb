This is an "odysessy through time" via computer animation, supposedly the work of more than 300 artists. Made in the late 80's and launched in 1990, this was a cutting-edge piece for the day. I thought it was good and quite interesting at some points. <br /> <br /> Most short scenes made no sense, just shapes evolving into other shapes, but that was fun to watch. This is all about visuals, not about any kind of story. There were some strange sequences in which strange-looking creatures danced around with birds heard. All this is computer animation, which was new at the time. Even the term "computer animation" was not well known. <br /> <br /> It's simply a chance to show off this new technology in little cartoon moments with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. Wordless, just photos with electronic music. Stoners must have really loved it. <br /> <br /> It's a good and intriguing 40 minutes of "eye candy" and "head candy". By the current CG effects, this may have lost its impact, but I think you'll still have fun with it.
