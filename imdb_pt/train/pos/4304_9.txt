I remember seeing this movie when I was 7; and at the time it shocked me. I had seen a violent movie before but never saw a movie with the consequences and the reality of violence. This film not only shows this, but also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and failed was not to be honest. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had an integrated anti-Facial bias) and reach him from a morally superior position. The Grand Canyon came to things from such a crude and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than the crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The end of the crash is this supposedly cool little ending that connects everything. While the Grand Canyon simply ends with a quiet note where you know that nothing will change much in the character's life, but that is because life also continues, there is no adequate end. No matter how good ... you're bad. There is no end of one chapter to begin another.
