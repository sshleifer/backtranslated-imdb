No, this is no fairy tale from Alice my friends! This Wonderland fable is based on the true story of the terrible Wonderland murders that took place in the '80s in California. At the center of this bloodbath was none other than Johnny Wad himself. Yes, John Holmes! Dad ding-dong wore other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine. In addition to being a legendary adult movie actor, Holmes was also a hardcore drug addict who became friends with several Hollywood addicts. Val Kilmer was occasionally majestic as Holmes, but for the first time this character of Holmes did not completely dominate him. The film features a 'who's who' of support players: Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood riffs, Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as women in Holmes's life, and Eric Bogosian as a menacing businessman from Tinsletown. These characters are integral parts, directly or indirectly, of the murders of "Wonderland". Outside of this support group, it was Josh Lucas who was the most fierce and impressive as the fiery Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually turning into a great Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Sweet Home Alabama'. Director James Cox at one point proved to be a little coxsucker, exhibiting a large amount of extended footage, as well as the famous organ of Holmes. Holmes was eventually acquitted of the murders of "Wonderland." He died of complications from the AIDS virus. 'Wonderland' will keep him wondering what really happened that bloody night, and if Holmes really stretched out his gun. Oops! Holmes Wrong Movie! It's ok! That's enough before I get penislized, I mean penalized. Bye Holmies! *** Average
