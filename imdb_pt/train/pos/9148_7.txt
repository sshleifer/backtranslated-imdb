A very underrated film that tells the story of a young musician trapped in a spiral of decline in domestic violence. <br /> <br /> Sometimes difficult to watch, while Morris Day is portrayed as the misogynist, Prince as the knight. in (motorcycle) steed, he is still called to twice beat a woman as part of the script. That he can do this and still emerge as a defective but justified hero is a credit to writing. Prince is so ego-free in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women, but his most famous song is fictionalized as being written by his father and Wendy & Lisa. What's more, two of his compositions - Computer Blue (admittedly the weakest track on the album) and Darling Nikki - are shown to be songs that kill an audience. Perhaps the only concession to the princely ego is a letter that lists the Apollonia (slightly smaller than the Prince) as 5'6. <br /> <br /> The almost complete-amateur cast is mostly the members of the band playing (and reviewers that The actors in terms that they have never appeared in other films are completely missing the point), and do perfectly well under the direction. Morris Day gets most of the applause for his nice ham, though Jerome Benton should also receive credit for jumping him, particularly at his stage show, which is hilarious. Day and Benton go so far as to make funny a routine of Abbott and Costello, which is a bit complicated. <br /> <br /> Finally, there's Prince. Although I admit that I have prejudice, I think he is a good actor in terms of being able to interpret a discreet version of himself. Acting Not your profession, this was a movie made for entertainment, so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role is not Robert DeNiro and thinking that they are making a point, unfortunately, is deluded. I do not want this comment to be a derisory attack from the comments of other people, but I even this film is on a low budget and being darkly lit. How would a movie about domestic violence be? With full spotlight and a CGI dinosaur coming into the frame? <br /> <br /> Does the film act almost like a perfect snapshot of the age of the neon and thin tie? until you remember that it was actually done in a world of curly perms and little synths, and this is not a retro-recreation. Prince's best Oscar-winning film, he sees it at its height, and it's overwhelming to realize that even if he made some great albums, he would never get that high again.
