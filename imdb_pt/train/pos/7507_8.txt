Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is accumulating quite a list of films that provide a glimpse of her specific era. His previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were at their best when they commented on the strangeness of society during this period. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously about Mrs. Page, it is a spine behind the world curtain of eccentric photo shoots from the 1950s. The film is fun to watch from both the perspective of story as well as the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and assembled. The grainy film and B & W photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done. The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh out of his Edward R Role of Murrow), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented, underappreciated and poorly crafted Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely hypnotizing in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Your smile is captivating and your body is flawless. She really seems to like this role and helps us understand how the Tennessee girl next door could become the Pin-Up Queen of the underworld. <br /> <br /> As you would expect, the soundtrack of the time is great. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured artists. Although the film does suggest providing a story in this industry, the final third falls half that preventing the sheer magic of cinema. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page makes this movie fun to watch and will yield endless presentations on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?
