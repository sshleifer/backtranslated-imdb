I can only echo the compliment of the other comments here. It is a delicious film with a good taste factor that reaches without going beyond the line for sentimental sentimentality. Naturally sweet - no added sugar. One small point: it seems to me that the slight objections raised about Pendelton, Ustinov's character, to be able to enter and defeat the security of the system ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / savant in this kind of thing. Yes, the film was quite illiterate, but it did show Pendelton 'studying computers' in his apartment, and I believe the implication should be that his gifts would allow him to simply embrace the whole matter, practically overnight. <br /> <br /> There were some strange moments in which appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test the knowledge of Pendelton and to call his bluff. I'm not sure if we should believe that Pendelton cunningly persuaded him to get out of these situations, or if he really had enough knowledge to pass the tests - it was a little uncertain. <br /> <br /> Surely he had to know enough to set up the fictitious accounts. Presumably Wallach and Ustinov were relying on their own hazy notion of how computers worked in those days, and to understand in detail what they were doing, it is necessary to know what their concept was. They knew there was something about "procedures" that was important; they thought that "intelligent light" could actually control security, rather than just indicate its state; they thought that the resources of the (mute) user terminal would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - though, in addition to things like graphical features, I did not see it. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I think they tried to avoid the subject of real computer operations as much as they could, and they did it very well. Allowing them a little artistic license, I do not think their efforts have any flaws worthy of note. <br /> <br /> CD
