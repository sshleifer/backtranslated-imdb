I absolutely loved this movie! It was so good! This movie is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie is given to girl Marie, as a gift. Paulie helps Marie learn to speak and they become best friends. But when Paulie tells Marie to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away. That's when the adventure begins. Paulie goes through a lot to find the way back to Marie. This movie is so sweet, funny, moving, sad and more. When I watched this movie for the first time, it made me cry. The courage of the birds and the desire to go find her Marie for all this time, was so touching. I must say that the ending is so sweet and sad, but you will have to watch to find out how it is. In the end, the caretaker tries to help you, after hearing your story. Will he find his long lost Marie or not? Find out when you watch this sweet heart warming movie. It will touch your heart.
