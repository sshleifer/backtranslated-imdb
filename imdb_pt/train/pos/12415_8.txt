This was obviously the prototype of Mick Dundee, but 'The Adventures of Barry McKenzie is funnier. I was amused everywhere and laughed out loud many times. Excellent central performance by Barry Crocker in the title role, an Australian who invades England to disturb the pompoms with their rude modes of free flowing. Few Brits will be annoyed by Barry's often cruel remarks about his hosts. The relationship between the two countries is thorny but friendly, and this is highlighted by the final line of the film, delivered by McKenzie somewhat reluctantly as he boards the plane home. "I was just beginning to like the poms."
