This movie is beautifully designed! There are no flaws. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where participants are on a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is at his best in this role. Its mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of its voice are without miscellaneous. Every shot meticulously done! Surprises appear one after the other when the movie passes the first hour. This may not be the best photo of the year, but it's a very well polished jewel. It is not for the simple mind.
