This is an incredible Amicus horror anthology, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances!, Only the last story disappoints. All the characters are amazing, and the film is very creepy and full of suspense, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are just amazing in that! It is very underrated and my favorite story has to be the third "Sweets To The Sweet", plus all the characters are very friendly. Some of them are predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and fairly bland!, However, the ending was pretty cool!. This is an amazing Amicus horror anthology, with 3 great stories and fantastic performances, only the last story disappoints !, I say you have to see! <br /> <br /> 1 st history ("Method for Murder"). This is an incredible story with a lot of suspense, and the Dominic killer is really scary, and it 's very well represented too!. This was the perfect way to start with a story, and for the most part it is unpredictable, plus the final double twist is shocking and quite scary!. Grade A <br /> <br /> 2nd story. ("Waxworks"). This is a solid story all around, with wonderful performances, but the ending is quite predictable, but it's still scary, and has a bit of suspense, Peter Cushing did an incredible job, and I could not believe how Joss Ackland was young, I I really enjoyed this story !. Grade B <br /> <br /> 3rd Story ("Sweets to the Sweet"). This is the best story here, as it is extremely scary and unpredictable everywhere, also has a nice touch too!. Christopher Lee did an incredible job, and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as the young daughter, plus the ending is quite shocking!. I do not want to ruin everything for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've ever seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> 4th story ("The robe"). This is a terrible story that is really weak and bland. Jon Pertwee annoyed me, but the ending surprised me a little bit, and Ingrid Pitt was great as always, but it's very boring and has been done many times, more where was the creativity. ??? Grade D <br /> <br /> The direction is great!. Peter Duffell does a great job here, with amazing camera work, great angles, adding a scary atmosphere, and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! <br /> <br /> The acting is incredible! John Bryans is great here, as the narrator, he had some great lines, I just wanted him to have more time on the screen. John Bennett is very good as Det., And was quite intense, he was especially good in the end! I really enjoyed it. Denholm Elliott is excellent as Charles, he was vulnerable, showed fear, was very friendly, and I loved his facial expressions, he rocked!. Joanna Dunham is incredibly beautiful !, and did very well with what she had to do as a wife, she also had great chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is incredibly scary as Dominic, he was scary, and did the job very well!. Peter Cushing is amazing as always, and he is amazing here, he is friendly, focused, charming and, as always, had a ton of class! (Cushing Rules!) Joss Ackland is fantastic as always, and he looked so young here, I barely recognized him, his accent was not so thick, and he played a different role than I loved! (Ackland Rules). Wolfe Morris is scary here, and he did what he had to do well. Christopher Lee is amazing as always and he is amazing here, he is incredibly intense, very focused, and since he always had that intense look on his face, he was especially incredible at the end ! (Lee Rules !!) Chloe Franks is adorable as her daughter, she is a bit scary, and gave one of the best child performances I have ever seen !, I loved her.Nyree Dawn Porter is beautiful and was great as the nanny, I liked her lots! Jon Pertwee upset me here, and it was rather bland, and completely bland, he also had no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful, and does what is usual in the Vampire and does well!. <br /> <br /> Rest of the cast does well. General not to be missed! **** of 5
