Several features of this film date immediately. The sound is quite strident and it is perceived that great advances were achieved in sound reproduction in the following years. The language of dialogue is rather old-fashioned and unnatural and the performance is still reminiscent of its transition from stage techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this initial period. of his very successful career. I do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression. I think it's the assumed cockney accent that does not sound true to me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan likes to immerse himself in dramatically intense human relationships that will appeal to all movie goers. As in many of her character roles, Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred. Leslie Howard is well chosen as the English artist with one foot in the club desperately seeking a partner and making a poor choice in a small waitress. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the young doctor finds his true love. on a busy street. They cross the traffic completely unrelated to a multitude of horns and whistles shouting at them. This scene is possibly destined to be funny, but I find this quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film. It is probably interpreted to send him home with a smile on his face. And finally how far we can see (and wait) is a happy ending.
