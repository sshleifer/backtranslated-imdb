This is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of photos on the spot. The Philippines replaces Thailand and no one goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of a jet Cathay Pacific jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly. This film proves that you do not need mega budgets or a leading star to produce an excellent movie. It contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that the young filmmakers often stumble. Solid work of people who know every aspect of cinema and who understand the compromises between art and box office. Great job!
