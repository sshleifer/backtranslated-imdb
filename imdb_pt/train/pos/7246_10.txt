This movie is completely ridiculous. It's not just the atrocious plot, but the acting is horrible. The special effects are asinine and the whole film is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. However, it is by far the most entertaining film that has ever been allowed to be produced. There are 101 minutes of laughter due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino. There are also other aspects that I will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully idiotic. I highly recommend this movie, just because of your total idiocy. I have no idea who would watch this hoping it was a high quality feature but if a good laugh is what you need, watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
