Note to previous reviewer: This movie is "Sci-Fi adaptation of the Iliad," according to the screenwriter. So if the references are painful or not, there are no excuses, it is the basis for the film. They admit they stole it ... although adapted to be the P.C. term. <br /> <br /> Great movie, but very short. Probably did not go as well as the author, director or studio wanted, but a lot of fun. The fact that the studio itself imploded during the creation only helps to increase its legacy. <br /> <br /> A big budget remake would not be so much fun, and probably would not do justice to the script anymore. But it's fun to dream about the potential there. A DVD release with a few extras is apparently available, but I do not think it would play on NTSC players. I'm not an expert and so I'm still trying to figure it out. For now, I live with the VHS incarnation.
