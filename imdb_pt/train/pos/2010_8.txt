I thought this movie was really good. Some parts were cheesy, but this is understandable since it was made over 55 years ago. I thought the best performance in the movie was given by Michele Morgan, who played Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also very good as Mike O'Brien. Even though I was not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, I think he was very good at it. If you have a craving for a silly and exaggerated musical comedy, Higher and Higher is the movie for you. <br /> <br />
