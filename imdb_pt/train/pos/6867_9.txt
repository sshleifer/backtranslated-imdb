I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the late 80's and 90's. I watched Groove Tube for the first time in 2001 when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And I found it hilarious. <br /> <br /> So for anyone who thinks that something "dated" can be very funny 30 years later ... think again! It's funny, even if you have no idea what the '70s were, and the thought of bell-bottom pants makes you cringe. Who can argue with a type of Bozo the Clown who reads adult literature? There is much to laugh about. The scrotal puppet show at the end is the best.
