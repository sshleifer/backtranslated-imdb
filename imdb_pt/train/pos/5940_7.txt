This short movie trailer is basically about Superman and Batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance. Obviously, the two characters have very different views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment. It's so much fun watching these two iconic characters trying not to get into the plot here. But I'm going to get into acting, which is great. Everyone is well chosen. The two actors who play Superman and Batman are well suited to their characters. The same filmmakers as Batman: Dead End and Grayson also did this short. Of the three, I probably liked this less, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the best in the world is a 7/10
