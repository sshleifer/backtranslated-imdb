There were several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, ex. Alain Delon. This role was also played by prominent actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but for me the best ever was Reed Hadley. This series gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, in the end. The series also performs well for several B movie actors such as Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a great performance of Hadley as Fox. He was quick, smart, wielded his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any fox.
