I think this movie is brilliant. There are many reasons, but these are some of them 1) The good acting of Tom and Tyler 2) Shiny machine gun scene that was a piece of shine 3) I thought the ending was a good cheer because I never expected that in the end the whole credit for Sam Mendes.as well as these 3 points the film form of the movie is good too. I'm a college film student and we studied this movie in great detail and it was one of the best movies I've seen in many years. I would like to thank all the people involved in making this film. Lastly, I'd like to say that the best scene in the movie is the scene of machine guns where John Rooney is dead, it's just pure glow on filming the scene in silence until John Rooney says "I'm glad it's you" is much better so, I think, because the viewer creates their own sound and that sound is totally different for each viewer, simply brilliant. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk at age 16.
