First of all, I would like to say that I am a big fan of Sarah Silverman, and that other people say that and that the cheat on the pilot is beyond me. Everything in the pilot was in the typical Sarah Silverman way, maybe not directly funny, but the situation and the delivery are what counts. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jesus it's Magic, so I do not see how you would do It's like this. It has the same flow and the same rhythm. It is true that it is only for the real fans, but if you go, you will be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Again, just for the real fans, there's no way around it. If you're not used to her style then you would not understand why this is funny. However, it is, and I hope you think so too.
