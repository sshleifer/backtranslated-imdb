Master Blackmailer, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton," is Sherlock Holmes' first feature film with Jeremy Brett I saw. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a sad, sad feeling, but it's quite entertaining (with some especially funny scenes). Spoilers Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson try to uncover the identity of an illusionary. blackmailer who has ruined some of England's most prominent families by publishing private letters that, in one way or another, destroy their lives. They eventually discover that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer," after the few tragic consequences for the victims who could not afford it. Our heroes must then help Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay an amount that is beyond her means, or else her future marriage will definitely be canceled. The scene in which Holmes and Watson assaulted Milverton's house is intense. Although the film has an essentially happy ending, the tone is sad and pitiful. Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy as the notorious villain (most audiences probably recognize him as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the scenes involving her and Holmes are a riot). I give you a *** 1/2 out *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough Inspector Lestrade. (I wish they had added in the scene at the end of the tale, where he gives the description of the two robbers, one of which corresponds to Watson.)
