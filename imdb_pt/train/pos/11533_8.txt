This movie, which begins with an interesting opening of two sexy blondes in the back of a vehicle without a driver, has a rather peculiar personality. The cast of seven (although a girl does not stand around to the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the number of dead is already so small) is super-hot, as our story revolves around teenagers partying in the desert (a strange , but effective choice of scenery), who are hunted down by a scary man with black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck. It predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("The Trip," "Joy Ride," "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer's own vehicle becomes an evil antagonist. The killer itself is rather scary, and we find solace in the extremely nice heroine in Jennifer McAllister (see the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all blacks, while our benevolent heroine wears all the white robes, as scarce and washed as possible be). Director Bill Crain does some really good things with his camera, some on-screen tricks, and the cast tries its absolute best. There's plenty of blood on the low body to please the fans, and enough T & A for some girls to please T & A fans. Overall, this movie is highly underrated and widely sought after in the world of horror films, as proved to be very rare to find on video. Highly recommended.
