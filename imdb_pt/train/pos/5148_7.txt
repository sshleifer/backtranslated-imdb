I do not know what it is with this movie. But films about history or religion are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course it's not 100% accurate. It is difficult to make 100% accurate movies nowadays, even when the "experts" disagree with each other. So I'd rather judge a movie for what it's trying to say than pick up all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I start by saying that I liked this mini series. But I agree with the critic that his childhood years were very fast. The series should have been a three-part story, his childhood being the first part. But if they did not have more money to film more stories, who am I to criticize it? <br /> <br /> There is only one real problem I have with this movie and this is the fact that it is told in a story. book way. Especially the second part, which is just a sum of the events that happened. I would rather have seen Hitler more human (more scenes where he doubts himself etc.). Noah Taylor did it more in the movie 'Max', which seems to work better, I think. However, I am happy to have been made and own it on DVD. Just to remember more vividly what happened and see Carlyle giving her best. 7.5 / 10
