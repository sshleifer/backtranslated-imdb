Larry Burrows has the distinct feeling that he's missing out on something. Since he lost a crucial baseball at the school that cost the championship, he is convinced that his life would have been better if he had made that move. Then one night your car breaks down again. Entering the nearest bar to wait for the trailer, Larry appears in bartender Mike, who, unbeknownst to Larry, is about to change his life forever ... <br /> <br /> The premise of alternative life in the cinema is hardly a novelty, going back to the tastes of It's a Wonderful Life and showing no signs of diminishing with the recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. It is a genre that has produced very mixed results. In the late 1990's was the production led by James Belushi, rarely mentioned when said topic appeared, seems to have been largely forgotten. Which is a shame as it exudes charm and is not short on humor department. We know that we are being brought to your ultimate message at the end, but it is a fun and enjoyable way to be taken down. The film also serves as a great comedian, actor James Belushi. I mean, if your smart drooling style and larking exasperation is not your thing? then you're likely to avoid this movie anyway. But for those engaged by companies like Red Heat, K-9 and Taking Care of Business, Mr. Destiny is right on the street. Along the ride are Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. Fate, pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message in your heart . 7/10
