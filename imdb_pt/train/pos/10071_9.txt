When tradition dictates that an artist should pass on his great skills and magic to an heir, the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as "The King of Masks," is desperate for a young apprentice to adopt and cultivate. His human warmth and humanity find him paying a few dollars for a small person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case huge floods in the 1930s. He takes his new 7-year-old companion to his thatched house, to live with his dear and handsome monkey, "General" only to find out that the child is a child. <br /> <br /> Life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave is entwined in the stultifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man. <br /> <br /> There are many stories within this. ... many people are touched and the culture of China opens up for our watching western look. Thousands of years of heritage are summed up in a cup of drama, and few will leave that DVD behind with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not so good as I found the sound levels everywhere. the meter, and can actually see the video transfer lines in various parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
