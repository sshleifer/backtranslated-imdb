Ride with the Devil, as Bro Leeback Mountain by Ang Lee, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. Film lovers should see it at least twice, because their artistic nuance is worthy of being understood. <br /> <br /> A perfect work of art, amazing depth of humanity. I really do not remember another war movie, will capture you, will change your existing conception of history and politics, will restore your belief in humanity. After seeing so many murders, so many sufferings, you do not feel numb, instead you value more the bond between humans. The performances of the actors haunt your heart, music drives your mind. Some buds are not just some pictures, they transcend themselves, becoming the vision of the soul. This is the true meaning of the film being a genre of art. <br /> <br /> A movie like this does not need comments or long reviews, all it says on its own. Ovation cast includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the director of photography and the composer of beautiful, lyrical music, which he conquers!
