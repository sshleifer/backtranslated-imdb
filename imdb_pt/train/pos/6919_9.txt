"Winchester '73 marked the first of a series of westerns involving James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Like most of them, Stewart's hero has a violent advantage that threatens to explode at any moment. The title refers to a "one in a thousand" rifle that is to compete in a gunfight held at Dodge City on July 4, 1876. In town comes Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his sidekick High Spade (Millard Mitchell) who are on the trail of the Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for a past cowardly act. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) drive the girl from Lola Hall (Shelley Winters) out of town. It turns out that Dutchman Henry is also in town for the shootout. Lin and the Dutchman Henry contend for the coveted prize with Lin winning, but the Dutchman Henry steals Lin from the gun and escapes. <br /> <br /> Lin and High Spade follow the Dutchman Henry across the country, where they meet Lola with his cowardly boyfriend. Steve Miller (Charles Drake) waits in a US cavalry camp awaiting the attack of the Indians led by Young Bull (Rock Hudson), who acquired the prize-winning rifle for assassinating the astute John McIntyre. He had gotten the gun by fooling the Dutchman Henry in poker. Young Bull is killed during the attack and the weapon passes to Steve. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Lola and Steve meet up with the notorious Waco shooter Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea), who kills Steve and grabs the gun. valuable rifle and Lola for himself. When Dean meets with the Dutchman Henry, he allows him to remove "his weapon" by planning to kill him later. In the town of Tuscosa, Lin kills Dean as Dutchman Henry's plans to hold the bank go badly and he escapes into the hills with Lin in pursuit. In one of the best final shots of all time, the two meet in the final clash. <br /> <br /> I believe that this film was the only one of the collaborations of Stewart / Mann that was filmed in B & W. It is beautifully photographed, especially the scenes in the "open spaces" and, in particular, the final confrontation. Stewart plays against the guy, plays the hero with a motivational edge of violent revenge, an emotion that he would lead to future films with Mann. <br /> <br /> Like most Universal westerns, this one has a cast of seasoned veterans and hires players of the day. In addition to those mentioned above, JC Flippen appears as chivalry sergeant Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as several henchmen, Ray Teal as Sherrie chasing Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as novice soldiers and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowlachie and John War Eagle in various roles following Dodge City. <br /> <br /> A classic western in every sense of the word. He was responsible for re-generating Stewart's career as an action star.
