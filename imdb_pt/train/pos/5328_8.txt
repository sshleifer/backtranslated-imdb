I still remember seeing this for the first time on TV. I could not believe the TVNZ allowed! I had to own it! Much of the humor will be lost on those who are not from New Zealand, but try it! Since the Back of the Y series was over, Matt and Chris have moved on to bigger and better things (?). New Zealand's biggest devil stuntman, Randy Campbell, has appeared many times on the British TV series Balls of Steel. Yes, he still takes all his action scenes because he's too drunk. <br /> <br /> Also the band 'house' Deja Voodoo released two albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The band is comprised of members of the Back of the Y team and singles like 'I Would Give You One Of My Beers' and 'You're Not Born In The 80's' continue with your mood <br /> < The South-By-Southwest Film Festival also featured the feature film 'The Devil Made Me Do It', which will be released in early 2008 in New Zealand. <br /> <br /> If you do not find these funny faces, then you can just F% ^ K OFF !!
