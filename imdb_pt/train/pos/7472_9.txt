I really liked this movie. I read some of the other reviews and although I pity those who did not understand it, I agree with some of the criticisms. Which, in a strange way, makes me like this movie better. I accept that they have a beautiful cast to remake a clever movie for the general public, but it has many levels and is still great to watch. I also love movies, like this one, that provoke so many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext. Congratulations Mr.Crowe, definitely on my Top Ten. <br /> <br /> Q. I saw this when I first went out while I was backpacking in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to return to my hotel and I had a great trip paranoia! Where does the dream end and the true begin?
