I loved this series when I was in Kids WB, I did not believe there was a spin-off of Batman since the original show ended in 1995 and this show came in 1997. First of all I loved the idea of ​​Robin leaving the Batman to solve crime on their own. It was an interesting perspective on their relationship. I also enjoyed the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and once again as its predecessor, this show had great story lines, great animation (better than the original), fantastic voice work and, of course, brilliant writing. The only thing I did not like was that it was when I was in the US, he used to shoot episodes in a 15 minute storyline. I just wanted some of the episodes to be longer. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoon comes in this series, and it's called "Over the Edge," in my opinion as good if not better than "Heart of Ice" and "Robin Count." Overall a good accompaniment, along with Superman this show made my childhood very happy.
