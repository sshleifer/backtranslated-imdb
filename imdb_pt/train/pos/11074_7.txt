Neither the total disaster that UK critics have claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece that their few fanboys insist on, Revolver is at least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add some substance to his mischievous conman. But then nothing is more despised than an ambitious movie that bites more than it can chew, especially one using the gangster / con-artist film structure. As might be expected from Luc Besson's name in producing credits, there is a definite 'look-and-feel' element on this: set in a sort of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, looks great, has a pair of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style, all of which mark as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply redo his own movies to make quick money, and spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If anything, the problem is that he is trying to use many influences (a little Machiavelli, a pinch of Godard, many Principles of Chess), motifs and techniques, covering the screen with quotations: the film was originally planned to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mafia victims, and sometimes it seems he never read a lucky cookie he did not want to turn into a movie. Instead of a commercial for Kabbalism, it is more a blend of the overlapping tenets of commerce, chess, and the trickery of trust, which most often takes away the difficult trick of making Theosophy accessible while concealing the central conodus both metaphysical). The last third is where most of the problems can be found when Jason Statham confronts the enemy (literally) with a very ambitious but not entirely entirely successful crosscutting inside the frame to contrast the outward bravado of the people with their inner fear and anger, but has a lot to do with it. It's not worth starting a new religion, but I'm surprised I did not get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally false tan too scary?
