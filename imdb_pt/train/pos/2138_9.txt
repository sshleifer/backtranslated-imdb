This film revolves around both Japanese culture and the lives of a modern Japanese family. Physical contact is frowned upon by those over the age of 7 (especially in public), so everything is bowing instead of embracing, even when you are close friends / relatives. Ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around another person and that in public too! Never the less ballroom dancing is (by far) hugely popular. People who do ballroom dancing in Japan are seen as nudists in the West ... many more would like to, but are inhibited by culture. A delightful family movie, which any amateur dancer would enjoy only the dance sequences. I understand it was more popular than the Titanic in Japan. I think the Japanese are like the rest of us - they like to be hugged too.
