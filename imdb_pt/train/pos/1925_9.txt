This has to be one of the best comedies on television right now. It takes the sweet and sweet idea of ​​a show that revolves around a close family and turns it into a very realistic representation of a typical family complete with brothers and fathers brigados, brothers brats, overprotective parents and crazy sisters. I'm almost surprised it's Disney! <br /> <br /> To his credit, '8 Simple Rules' knows it's a comedy and does not try to be more. Many shows (for example, 'Sister, Sister' and 'Lizzie McGuire') think that just because their main characters are now teenagers, so they should deal with social issues and end up losing their moods being too harsh. This is a trap '8 Simple Rules' avoided; addresses some issues (such as being the school's outcast), but has fun doing it. In fact, the only time he was really serious was understandable when he dealt with the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think that although John Ritter misses it, since he was the reason the show left its mark, '8 Simple Rules' can still do well to remember humor and not do father of Cate a second version of Paul Hennessy.
