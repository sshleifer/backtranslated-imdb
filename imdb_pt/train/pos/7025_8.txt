I found this a lovely adaptation, very lively and full of fun. With the exception of some big mistakes, the cast is wonderful. I have to echo some of the previous comments - Chynna Phillips is terribly miscast as a teenager. At age 27, she's just too old (and, yes, it shows), and she does not have the "cutlets" sung for Broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a decent enough singer and, for a non-dancer, she is adequate. However, she is not Latina, and her character definitely is. She is also very strict, which is tiring. <br /> <br /> The girls from Sweet Apple's Conrad Birdie club really shine - with special compliments to Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoyed Tyne Daly's performance, although I'm not usually a fan of her work. Finally, the dancing Shriners are a riot, especially the three idiots in the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is suitable for the whole family, and I strongly recommend it.
