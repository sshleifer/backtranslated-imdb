This movie is another horror anthology. It's good, but could have used a little more. I compare it to "The House of Horrors of Doctor Terror", although in this case the title fits. It has four stories, all connected by a house. The first tale is about a writer and his wife moving. He creates a killer for his latest novel and then he begins to see the killer wandering around his house. This is kind of predictable, but it does make some twists in the end. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where you're going. This features Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the group. This guy buys the house, but it's not the house that occupies the center of the stage, but a strange wax museum. The third story begins pretty good and features Christopher Lee. This one has him as a rather bizarre father who seems very protective of his daughter. The problem is that once you know what's happening, the story does not end soon. Drag a little, leading to a very predictable conclusion. So the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from a weird little shop. The actor actually gets what he paid for. Then there is a short story about an officer who is seen in every attempt to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. Although I was not very pleased with the explanation, I do not think she really explained the Cushing story. I think they needed a little more history for this. After all, it was an interesting set of stories.
