Erroll works for the Department of Public Security and his job is to check out sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line in his work and hits the sex offenders. I do not blame him, but his boss is ready for him to retire, so come Allison. Erroll is now training her to do her job and it's like a shady job. Allison is a bit naive about the work at the beginning, but she does not realize how much danger she really is and it's all Erroll's fault. He begins to get away with his obsession with finding a missing girl when his job is not to be a cop. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the limits and works out his "scope of practice." Erroll did a good job, but in the name of Allison's safety. There is some good mystery to him too, and it was only when I had discovered it that there was more to it.
