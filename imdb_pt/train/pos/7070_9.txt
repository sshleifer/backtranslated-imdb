One of the most compelling elements of a Gilliam movie is that well-made visuals, disturbing scenarios, and manicomically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator's involvement. Instead of most of the movies (where the filmmaker is a director of rental that is paid to present a star or two), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through experience. "12 Monkeys" is evidence of Gilliam's vision and style, as opposed to making eccentric films for her own sake. "12 Monkeys" is a variation of similar themes from Gilliam's repertoire: oppressive / recessive societies, the solitude of the protagonist, the frustration associated with disbelief and parallel realms. In this film, Gilliam does a good job of blurring lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to believe instead of knowing. This tendency of Gilliam to neglect the filling of certain gaps leads to criticisms of the pretension of art. The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all of their images have meaning. Cole's two almost identical bathing scenes at the beginning are meant to make comparisons that leave the public uneasy. His bald head is a mark of uniformity in the future world full of illnesses but makes him recognizable in the world of 1996. The title itself is a hallmark of Gilliam's creativity as it requires that most of the story materialize so that its meaning is fully understood. In short, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch also require thought and interpretation from the audience. The film has immense re-clock value, as there are subtle details and tips that can be missed on the first display. Definitely one of my favorites.
