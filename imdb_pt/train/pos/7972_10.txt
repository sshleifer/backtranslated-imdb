I watch this movie all the time. I watched with the ages of 3 to 87, and all between the two; They all loved it. It really shows the true scenes that a dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Simply gorgeous. <br /> <br /> It's great for those who love comedy movies, tear-jerker movies, or even just pets. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes truly thought, and the characters perfect. What I liked about the characters are the true and well mixed personalities: Shadow (The Elder, a Golden Retriever) He is the wise, full of wisdom and mentality of any dog, Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a cub with a witty side, the comic character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan Cat) She is the real cat that shows what a real cat will do for its owner, the real cat.
