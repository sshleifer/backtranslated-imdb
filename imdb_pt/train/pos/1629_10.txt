This movie is so cheap, it's captivating !!! With Ron Liebmann (Major Vaughn) providing the most entertaining diatribes on screen in film history. I own 2 copies of this movie on video ... in one, Ralph Macchio is actually caught in the background in Major Vaugn while he is complaining in "Hash". Obviously, they forgot to edit this movie error, but this shows how funny the movie is, when the actors can not keep a serious face !!!
