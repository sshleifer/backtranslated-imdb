'Mad Dog' Earle is back, along with her moll Marie with sad sack, and that uncontrollable Velma. The same goes for Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even the Pard mutts. The only thing missing is a good reason to redo the Raoul Walsh High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame, and make it with talent noticeably one or two steps down the ladder from the original. (Instead of Walsh, we have Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart, we have Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on.) The only change is that this time, instead of black and white, it's in Warnercolor ; unfortunately, there are those who would consider this an improvement. <br /> <br /> I died a thousand times can it be unnecessary? and lower? but at least it's not a farce; the story still works in its own theatrical terms. Earle (Palance), just out of the pen near Chicago, heads west to lead a major job planned by crime lord Lon Chaney, Jr. overturning a mountain resort. On the way, he almost collides with a family of Oakies, when he is in love with his granddaughter; the wound remains even when he discovers she's limp. Arriving at the huts where the rest of the gang holes, he finds enthusiastic amateurs in each other's throats, as well as Winters, who throws himself at him (as does the little dog). Passing time until they get a call from their inner man in the hotel, Palance (to Winter's disgust) offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity, a backfiring gesture. Then the surgical attack on the resort turns into a bloodbath. In the lam, Palance moves higher in the cold Sierras .... <br /> <br /> It is a sufficiently absorbing story, executed with competence, that does not have the distinction that Walsh and his cast brought to him in 1941, the year Bogie, with this role and Sam Spade's in the Maltese Falcon, became a star. And one last heretical note: these mountains look beautiful in color. <br /> <br />
