A horror movie is being filmed and things are not going well. It's about a masked killer. The director tells the killer in front of the cast and crew. He goes crazy and kills two people. He killed himself and the movie never ends. Twelve years later, a group of film students decide to try to finish it - but there is a curse. The people who try and finish are dead. Students ignore this. Guess what happens next? <br /> <br /> The plot is old hat but this is not bad ... for what it is (a low budget slasher movie). It is well done with a young and talented young cast. No one is great, but no one is terrible either. It also avoids the mandatory (and unnecessary) female nudity scenes. He moves fast, blood is good and bloody, and the script does not insult his intelligence. Molly Ringwald is also in this having the time of its life interpreting a sulky actress. <br /> <br /> No great trembling, but not bad. I give a 7.
