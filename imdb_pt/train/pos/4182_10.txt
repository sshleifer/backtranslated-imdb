I saw this Australian movie about 10 years ago and I never forgot that. The film shows the horror of war in a way that Hollywood usually covers. The relationship between the soldiers of the two countries at war is highlighted by differences of culture and final knowledge that in the end we are not really different inside. If you can find any type of copy of this, buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just impressed.
