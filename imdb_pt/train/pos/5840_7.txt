Although the premise of the film is quite ridiculous (Ollie is diagnosed with "hornophobia"), the film is a nice little movie. It's also a bit better than the movies they made after this one - probably since this was the last Laurel and Hardy film produced by Hal Roach. In fact, it would not be a bad idea not to see any of his latest films, because all the chemistry is lost in these films and the boys interpret their parts purely pathetic - something true that the Laurel and Hardy films would NEVER do. They had a bit of an edge that all subsequent movies lack. Stan and Ollie work in a horned factory. That sounds really funny, but it's not. Not surprisingly with the whole racket, Ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and should take some time off from work. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his last film with the team) recommends an ocean voyage. However, they do not like sailing and Stan has an idea of ​​just renting a boat tied to the dock - so they can get all the sea air they want without all the hassle! Once they are in the boat, a dangerous criminal escaped the boat and they all accidentally left for the sea. Fortunately, this part of the movie really was very rhythmic and the ending worked very well. <br /> <br /> Although not a big feature film for Laurel and Hardy, it was much better than many of them since it did not have annoying and disturbing musical numbers (as in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN TOYLAND). Plus, there's still a decent amount of physical comedy - something you would not see nearly anything after that movie. Part of this was due to the decline of the boys' health (and the increase in Ollie's circumference), and part of it was due to the general insipidity of these later films.
