I was not alive in the 60's, so I can not guarantee that this film was a completely accurate representation of the period, but it certainly is an exciting and rewarding experience. There are some excellent performances, most notably by Josh Hamilton (of With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who plays brothers divided by war. Bill Smitrovich, an actor who has long been ignored for many years, gives a heart-filled performance as his strict father, who is forced to question his own beliefs and values ​​while one of his sons makes him proud going to Vietnam, but returns empty inside, while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all, this is a powerful and moving film that I hope everyone has a chance to experience.
