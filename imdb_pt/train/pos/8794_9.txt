Chang Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" may very well be the watermark of the Shaw Brothers martial arts film cycle. This exciting epic kung fu features an incredible cast - a true who's who of Shaw's stable. Although the plot is fairly standardized and the fighting choreography is superb as ever, it is the way Cheh handles the subject that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable. The sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is palpable in every picture. Not unlike William Keighley's slogan for the legendary Fighting 69 in the same self-taught film or John Ford's West Point salutation in "The Long Gray Line," Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" is a love ode in that same style. <br /> <br /> The cultural correlation I am tempted to do is to compare the Shaolin Temple to the Alamo. Watching this movie will give you the same feelings of awe and nostalgia you experienced many years ago in elementary school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed Alamo heroes. At the end of the movie, you may also be tempted to shout: Remember the Shaolin Temple!
