I went to Camp Chesapeake. It was located at the head of Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It was a similar type of summer camp with booths. It was established by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started out as a young camper and later became a senior advisor, and then the director of Waterfront. If the camp had continued, I would have done anything in my power to become the director of the camp. Unfortunately, the YMCA's powers decided to close the camp and sell it to the state of MD. I visited the old camp a few years later by boat and was dismayed by the neglect of the state of MD and natural destruction by Mother Nature. The 350 acre site has served many with all the benefits of contact with nature's offerings. A black named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and guardians of the estate. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I have idolized all your beings. Even though he could not swim, he was a water man. If I asked him where the fish was biting he would designate the place and I would have a ball. There was also a Family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me for all eternity.
