This is a good movie, but it is not recommended if you do not like smart movies. It's about two guys who want the world to go away, and that's exactly what they get. The acting is great, the ending was not predictable and actually had a good story different from most movies these days. People complain that the movie is too simple or too boring. I think they should stick only to movies like The Toxic Avenger (I really like B movies) or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. One note: If you realize this, this has exactly the same Cube actors, except for four actors. Make two notes: Wait after the credits (trust me). Enjoy the movie.
