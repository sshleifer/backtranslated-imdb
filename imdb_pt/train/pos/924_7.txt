Father of pride is a pleasant surprise: he's funny, witty, and has great voice acting. The show is about the family of a Lion who is acting as an attraction to Siegfried and Roy's shows. In fact, they are all stereotypes, but that's what makes them so funny. FOTP is not a childish drawing, but includes a rough adult humor, but in a very gentle way. It is full of cultural references and celebrity appearances and most of them are very well executed. I'd say I'm going to give the show a 7 out of 10 because it's cool pretty well executed but not very original, I've seen many of these stereotypes many times before, even in that particular order!
