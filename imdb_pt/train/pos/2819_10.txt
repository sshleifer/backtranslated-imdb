This movie is bufoonery! and loved it! The "dragon lord" (Jacky Chan) and his friend, "cowboy," made the film fun, meaningful and simply silly. The film is a rare blend of fighting evil and (somehow) the wonders and fun that are booming. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragon lord" (so named because he is the son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy" which include the implementation of intelligent and elaborate ways to escape from studying help from the whole family, including the tutor), competing quite childishly (and idiomatically interesting) to win the affection of a local girl, competing in "football" (you'll see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow, they find themselves in the midst of a struggle to save the sending of valuable antiquities and the lives of several people. <br /> <br /> The film has its most serious moments. But they do not depress, but inspire. The boys' play is not lost in this exchange, but is actually employed against evil. What I really loved about this movie is how it ends. It is not the typical confrontation (which in itself was incredible) but well, you will see. Let me tell you that it really captures the spirit of the movie. Silly, witty, meaningful and nostalgic. great movie.
