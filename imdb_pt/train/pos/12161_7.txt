From the writer of "What Happened to Baby Jane?" and "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte", this tail-end of the terror cycle of the sixties has some strange and exaggerated fun. Micheál Macliammóir does a kind of Victor Buono type, but often the movie comes dangerously close to a bad musical ... there is a particularly horrible children's recital in the middle of the road. Debbie hits, tangos and cheats on there Harlow, while the religious fanatic of Winters has a lesbian advantage for her. Agnes Moorehead enters as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do - and he even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
