Would the more romantic comedies be as skillfully executed as these? I never thought that something as mundane as selling a music box would let me catch my breath with excitement. Margaret Sullavan is a wonderful saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought the best to each other. This movie shows what I think is the most winning performance of Frank Morgan, and with "The Wizard of Oz" and "Tortilla Flat" on his resume, that's saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner made me dizzy with joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch may have thought that "Trouble In Paradise" is his favorite, but this must certainly be considered a triumph. With some wittiest dialog the American films of the thirties has to offer.
