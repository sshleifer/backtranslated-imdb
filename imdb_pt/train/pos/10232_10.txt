Having seen most of Ringo Lam's films, I can say that this is his best film to date, and the most unusual. It is an ancient piece from the Chinese period full of martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as important a role as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and fun, and the setting is truly memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise was not made available on DVD and VHS is almost impossible to use, even if you're near China's second largest city in North America (like me). If you can find it, do not let it pass.
