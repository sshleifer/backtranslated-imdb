Norman, is that you? was (that's all third-hand, so grab it with a grain of salt) adapted to an African-American family of a Jew when he made the transition offstage and onscreen. Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed on video, so the theater's impressions could not have been so good. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were very good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell everyone is that the film is a special piece: it reflects the attitude of the mid and early 70's about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family. Just for that reason, it's quite interesting - if not a little "hollywood". Do not believe me? Check lines on curtains, etc. Very stereotyped. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the film really shines in some areas. There is a parallel scene when Redd Foxx is trying to find his wife, who is fleeing with her brother (!) To Ensenada in a poisoned Pinto. The telephone conversation across the border is truly memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs. As far as I know, this is the only time this routine was filmed. And it's a slightly clean and much shorter version, I'm told. Still, it's vintage Madame, and should not be missed. People are still stealing Wayland lines; the man was truly talented. Enjoy the movie!
