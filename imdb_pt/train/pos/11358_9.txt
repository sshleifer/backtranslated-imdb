The poor quality of DVD video is the only reason I gave this movie a 9 instead of 10. This could have been a lot better, this movie deserves it. <br /> <br /> This is really a movie that covers several themes simultaneously. If you do not like serial killers, but you are fascinated by the bureaucratic culture in the former Soviet Union, this movie is a must-see nonetheless. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to "Silence of the Lambs" for several reasons. The way the serial killer is portrayed was much better in Citizen X. You see a lot of details of your private life because you "travel" along with the killer, which gives you an idea of ​​the source of your constant anger and anger. sexual frustration. <br /> <br /> The only other film I saw that is as realistic as this was "Henry - Portrait of a Serial Killer". If you've been fascinated by this movie, you definitely need to take a look at Citizen X.
