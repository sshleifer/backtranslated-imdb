I only watched the first series on DVD, but I would sum up The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a script similar to Tarantino. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (hence not a "10"), and much better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there is a lot of action, some of them very bloody, the story is directed by characters. Even some of the secondary characters contribute to the great lines of history; for example. the relationship of the priest (or lack of) with Carmilla and the wife of the owner of the restaurant, and Christopher and his idiot friend (who did not last long (one nominated for the Darwin Prize?)) plot, script and performance, the other reasons why I liked it; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with tomato sauce. 2. Music 3. This shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
