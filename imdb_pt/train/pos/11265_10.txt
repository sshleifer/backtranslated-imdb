I never really knew who Robert Wuhl was before I saw this. But after seeing it, I realized what a funny man he is. This HBO special introduces him teaching "American history" to college film students in New York and the man was simply phenomenal. He scoffed at almost every major historical event that occurred not only in the US, but in other parts of the world. This documentary / comedy was a great satire that made me wonder if what I accept as the true unfailing story is actually true. <br /> <br /> I liked how Mr. Wuhl was able to mix useful information with great comedies and made learning much more exciting. I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and willing to question what their beliefs are.
