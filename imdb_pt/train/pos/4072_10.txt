The name Hayao Miyazaki became prominent with Spitied Away, however, what is often overlooked are the director's first film efforts. Who remembers that Spielberg drove Duel or George Lucas drove THX 1138? I remember seeing fragments of this film - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in the late 80's and what remained with me was the visual exuberance of design and animation. So when I found a copy in a well-known shop for Â£ 9, I could not resist, but I bought it. The curious thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not match my memory (the memory is funny). <br /> <br /> Watching this movie now with all the knowledge gained on the portfolios of artists is as much like Jean 'Moebius' Giraud, some of the artworks are. I can only assume some influence here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta) his adventure really begins - the search for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift's neglected portion of Gulliver's Travels. With healthy references to Jules Verne, it is a basic film of good and bad persecutions, with the final part having the heroes finished in Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the part that is strongest in my memory - the 'pastoral'. The ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of moss-covered robots under the giant tree. This is, in my opinion, the highlight of the film - the visions of the surface of Laputa, as opposed to the underground mechanized. <br /> <br /> Although this is the dichotomy of this film - to show that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot taking care of the garden and animals. The ending of the Silent Running movie is almost exactly the same. <br /> <br /> It's incredibly stylish, I would not say 'slick' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in buildings, dirigibles and the design and appearance of just about everything. <br /> <br /> Myazaki is a true master of this type of Japanese anime. Buy this movie and value it.
