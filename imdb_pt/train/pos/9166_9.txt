If a more masterly adaptation than this one existed, you do not have to look for it; you will find more and more in this almost perfect presentation of Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie that asked me to read the novel it was based on, but I admit it. On here. Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I have lost very little in the way of dialogue, plot, intensity and emotion. I just want to explore the novel because of the immense curiosity and excitement that this masterpiece has awakened within me. <br /> <br /> I do not need to divulge anything in the way of the plot here. Let me just say this: if you're maybe not sure if you should watch or read the beautiful story that is Jane Eyre, I beg you for no more doubts! Every atom of power and magic that created Jane Eyre as a popular classic of English literature was successfully captured in this film. <br /> <br /> What Brontë did not bring with him, Clarke and Dalton managed to translate the spotlight with great intensity. The success of the film is undoubtedly due largely to its ability to perform. <br /> <br /> Love Jane Eyre or hate her, but enjoy the richness, the vitality, the truth of the story; I love the characters; love the actors; all exactly how you would love what is great in the movies.
