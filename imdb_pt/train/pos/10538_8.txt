I work in a movie store and as such, I'm always looking for an excellent movie. I decided to take a look at Nothing while it was in our Canadian section, and I have been trying to support the film industry in my country. I was in for a surprise. The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a very entertaining story that seems to plunge so much into our minds and relationships ... without working so much. It is consistently comic through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some funny exchanges ("We can not be dead, we have cable!"). What else can I say without noticing it's worth a shot, even if you abandon it within the first half hour.
