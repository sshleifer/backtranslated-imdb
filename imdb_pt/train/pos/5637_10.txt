I just like to say that I've seen this movie twice now and I love it! The acting is great and even if it's a plot like "Raise Your Voice" I think the plot never gets boring for people who like that sort of thing. It has some great lessons and shows us that we can do anything if we try. An incredible movie. I'm sure this is one I'll be watching for a long time to come. Even though Britney Spears writes the book, it's a fairly realistic plot, perhaps not on the part of falling in love, but the part of being different and fighting, but coming out better in the end, is very true to real life. The only minor criticism is why the lead girl in these movies is always beautiful? Do you really think Holly would have found the perfect face of your dreams if she were ugly or mean? I doubt it..
