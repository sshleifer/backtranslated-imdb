What can I say about a tale like that? This magical tale has accompanied me since my childhood, evoking warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to so many extravagant places, making you want more of each scene. For example, on the market, there were so many different flavors of knowledge. I loved the exotic dancers who accompanied the steel drums. <br /> <br /> The plot was wonderful. I really wanted Landsbury to decide to keep the kids early and for her to stay with Mr Brown as well, and find the other half of the spell so the least-armored men can win the war. <br /> <br /> I'm still a child inside, and this movie attracts my inner child like no other. This movie is my definitive favorite of all time. I hope all children can watch this classic and be dragged and transported for another time.
