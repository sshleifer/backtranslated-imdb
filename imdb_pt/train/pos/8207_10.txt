Sudden Impact is a story on two fronts. Harry is targeted by the mob who wants to kill him and Harry is very happy to return the favor and show how it is done. This little war puts Harry in suspension, which he does not mind, but he goes away on a vacation. Now the second part of the story. Someone is killing some punks and Harry is dragged into this situation where he meets Jennifer Spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to be quiet. The chief of police is not a subtle man and he warns Harry not to get involved or cause trouble. This is the problem Harry Callahan follows him. The crowd accompanies him to this city and hell breaks open when Harry goes to war. Meanwhile, the vigilante attacks again and the gang finds that it is ready for her. Jennifer Spencer gets caught and Harry comes to her rescue during the movie's climax. Sudden Impact is not the greatest Dirty Harry, but at the time gives us a Harry who is an anti-hero ready to go to war just to pursue justice. Again, not the best, nor the worst, but the one with the most remembered line. Go ahead Make your day.
