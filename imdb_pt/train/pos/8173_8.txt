The brightness of this movie is that even a competent dentist is quite scary. It is one of the primordial fears of man. This movie is the nightmare picture that every child has to go through in the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a deranged dentist who I think tries to kill people, but he only works with his teeth, so it's not really working out. In a particularly bloody scene, we find actor Earl Boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and other embellishments, which I think is the worst thing you can do when you are a killer dentist. It's a typical Brian Yuzna situation, not well written, but there's blood. The plot is of poor quality and sometimes seems to be done locally, but hey, it's a killer dentist movie, we all thought about it, but they did it first.
