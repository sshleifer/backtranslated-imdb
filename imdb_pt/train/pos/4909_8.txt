Most of the films about New Orleans, or New Orleans, turn out to be ridiculously bad, and ridiculously inaccurate (examble: remember "The Savage Bees"? But I'll make an exception for "Tightrope," which almost hit). <br /> <br /> Here's one that does not inevitably go wrong. The accents are not so bad (yes, the "yat" accent here is much more than southern Brooklyn), the 1950s city is shown the way it is, without the mandatory "tourist" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a "peculiar southerner". <br /> <br /> One of the few movies to do justice to this city, and a good movie to boot ..
