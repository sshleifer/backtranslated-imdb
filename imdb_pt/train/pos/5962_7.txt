I've seen a number of "80s rock horrors" over the years, from junk like "Terror on Tour" to ridiculously fun gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2". Somehow, I managed to maintain this, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and well received. Well, I finally managed to catch up with him and it's easily the best of this mostly terrible (but almost always captivating) subgenre. The plot (which was greatly raised in the movie "Black Roses") concerns a misfit named Eddie, who was ridiculed by everyone in his school for his musical taste. He loves the metal of the 80s, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by the late great Tony Fields). After Sammi is killed, Eddie's favorite radio DJ gives him the final recording of Sammi. Once Eddie plays the album backwards, he discovers that it's a bit more difficult, and bad things start to happen to those who insult him. Sammi's music is owned? "Trick or Treat" is well done and a total joke. The special effects are impressive despite presenting the typical 1980s laser beams. I grew up in the 80s, and while I was not a heavy metal fan, I remember the urban legend about playing a disco back listening to the sounds of Satan worshiping. Haha! I also remember my older brothers and neighbors that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan, so it's so much fun watching the two make appearances as a harmless radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. If I had seen this movie as a child! While the film seems to mock the 1980s popular connection between the supposed cult of the devil and heavy metal, the viewer never finds out why Sammi Curr is back from the dead, creating havoc and killing whoever stands in his way. This is the weakest point of the movie, but if you can ignore it, it's a lot of fun.
