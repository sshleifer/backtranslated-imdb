I have noticed that many people who post on "Kerching!" plate seems to hate this show, which I really find very surprising. I think it's one of the best British children's shows out there. It's a shame it's ending because it's very funny (if a bit tacky at times) and has great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boy, though much smarter. With his two best friends, he tried to earn a million pounds for his mother by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of "Rudeboy." His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who has a simple spirit and a comic relief character). Throughout the show, some characters came out and new ones appeared, but it's always been fun and it's getting better.
