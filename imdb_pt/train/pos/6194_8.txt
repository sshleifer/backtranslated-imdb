Henry Fool surprised me. I did not expect it to be fun and fun, or as strong as that. Fay Grim continues to amaze as it provides solid continuation to a story that does not seem to need it. Once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the film, however, it becomes blindly aware that this is one of the best sequences for the brilliant indie film. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's part is so small, but I'm glad he's part of this short term. He is convincing and charming as a Fulbright agent. Also a delight is Liam Aiken who portrays Ned Grim, son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pleasure for many reasons. I'm happy, for example, to find out that Henry is not really the loser that he looks like (until the end of the Fool), and find out more that he's actually a genius ... well, that's really a lovely I hope that they make a third ... as the end of the trilogy. It seems to be missing. They should title him Ned Fool Grim and it must be Liam looking for his father, to validate the awesome change in his mother, and the almost genius feel that he himself feels inside it. Assuming, of course, that Fay continues to withhold many of his son's most important facts about his father. It looks like it needs to be done. I would buy. <br /> <br /> Even with more action, this is still not an action movie. It's more drama and intrigue ... a mystery, in a way. I will watch it many times. <br /> <br /> The rate is 8.3 / 10 of ... <br /> The Devil :.
