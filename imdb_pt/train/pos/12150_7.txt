This film is one of the many action movies "Kung Fu" made in Asia in the late 70's - early 80's, full of cheap sound effects, dubbed dialogue and quick martial arts action. But unlike most movies of that genre, it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy. When workers at a paint factory are forced out of their jobs by Manchu bullies, they hire a cheater (Gordon Liu) to try to scare them. When his attempt fails miserably, he manages to enter the Shaolin Temple to learn how to fight for truth. But instead of making him a Kung Fu student, the Master instead orders him to build a scaffold to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well, it turns out that while he is performing these household chores (stacking and tying bamboo sticks) he is learning the skills to be a Kung-Fu expert! It's like in the Karate Kid, when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate, causing him to do routine household chores - "Wax on, wax off," etc. There is a lot of comedy from beginning to end, and a lot of action at the end, when Gordon Liu once again faces his Manchus tormentors. "This time it's not just tricks - it's the real thing!" Liu declares, proudly beating his chest. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you will not want to miss this one!
