Being a fan of the first Lion King, I was definitely looking forward to this movie, but I knew there really was no way to be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are wary of the direct movies for the video, since I have mixed feelings about them as well. <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 ½, I tried to find out what my own point of view was about this movie. Will I be so devoted to the Lion King that I will understand in certain scenes, or will I just accept this film as just another look at the Lion King story? Most of the time, I found myself hugging the last one. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments. Timon and Pumba stole the show in the first film and definitely deserved a movie centered around them. People just love these characters! My favorite parts of the film include the Timon & Pumba montage caring for the young Simba and the surprising ending featuring great appearances. <br /> <br /> I could have done without many of the bathroom jokes as the real reason why everyone bowed to the baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1. I think these types of jokes are for the group I do not think many kids are really worried about Disney's profit margin. However, I will say that I was a bit annoyed when they directly tied scenes from the original movie for this movie. I'm very familiar with the original that these scenes just stood out as thumbs for me. <br /> <br /> Something would be different with the music or the voices that would distract me. <br /> <br /> As for the song, it was not so bad, but it was not "Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella have done a great job as always, and even if it was not for the movie, new members of the cast, the classic c the one with Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (better known as Marge Simpson) did a great job as well. You can even take advantage of these great voice talents by checking Safari Virtual on Disc 2 of the DVD. This feature is definitely a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> So overall, The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect movie, but it's cute and fun. I think many Lion King fans will have fun and appreciate it for what it is - a fun and carefree look at the Lion King masterpiece from the perspective of our funny friends.
