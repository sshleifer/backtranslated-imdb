I just do not understand why this movie is being defeated here. Wow. It's stupid, it's not polished and it's (as I'm reading) wasted on some. The cast of this movie plays its characters for the 'T' (If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a fan of Ben Stiller, then yes, you will be disappointed). These are maladjusted, well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city / world with nothing but determination and determination. The problem is they do not realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point! This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was still criticized by the same demographic group, probably the same people who feel the first AP movie pales in comparison to the sequel. I just do not understand. The jokes work on more than one level; If you do not understand, I know at what level you are.
