I used to love watching it. I had no idea it was part of a larger series. I should have been about six years old by the time I was on TV. I just found it funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination for something that was clearly in the president's pile of bath toys. My parents recorded this from TV when it aired on NBC. The tape still had Sanka's old commercial coffee along with a few others. I'm thinking of coming home soon and I'll try to tape the tape to my computer so those who want a copy can do it. If any of you want to get in touch with me, I think you can do that through the IMDb site. I'll keep you updated and let you know when I have the show in digital format.
