I saw this when I was 17 and have not seen it since. The 'CBS Late Movie' used to show it on a regular basis at one point. I remember how sad and upsetting it really made my stomach hurt. The effects, then, were not what they are today, but nevertheless conveyed the feeling of being alone in the Amazon, after losing the parents and looking for a way out, very well. I remember the insects and larvae more, as realistic as they were, eating their flesh. It's a dark movie that was controversial at the time, though it was probably heavily edited for TV. I would like to remember more details, and if I have the chance to see it again, I can comment more. I've been looking for this for years. I believe it may have been shown on CBS under another title. I have no idea if it was already released on video.
