Oh, what fun there is here! Amy Heckerling has a talent for directing comedy (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Look Who's Talking), but here it seems she told the actors to go out and have fun. Micheal Keaton breezes into the role of Johnny, easily his best on-screen performance. Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin, who directors of shame did not understand it. And I even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character's unique vocabulary. I do not think it's an accident that most of the character's name is written MORON. Good lines are scattered throughout the film, with Peter Boyle, Griffit Dunne.Maurren Stapleton, Merilu Henner gave good lines. Even actors with smaller roles, such as Dick Butkus and Alan Hale, get in good shape. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to a friend.
