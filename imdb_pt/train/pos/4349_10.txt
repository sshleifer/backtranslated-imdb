Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) unexpectedly arrives at his son's place. His son Ben Kleinman (Paul Reiser) is surprised to learn that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis) has left her father. Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) and their three sisters try to find Muriel while Ben and his father are going to see a farm that is for sale. But this is not the end of your journey. His journey turns into a long therapy session between Ben and his father. Raymond De Felitta is the director. Reiki is behind the script and he did a remarkable job. The dialogue between Ben and Sam is simply incredible. And he worked with the script for twenty years, so no wonder it's that good. Who would be better man to play the father than Peter Falk? No one, I can tell you this. And I really love the story about why Paul wanted Peter Falk to part. Peter was an actor who made his own father laugh. And Peter certainly made me laugh in this movie. It's just hilarious when they go fishing.And as the old man beats the youngest in the game of billiards and then hits him with his dick.The movie is often very funny and I have seen myself laughing several times.But he may also be playing from time to time. You could not tell a better story than is said here.
