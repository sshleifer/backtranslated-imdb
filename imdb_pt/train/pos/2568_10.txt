In this sequel to the 1989 K-9 action comedy, Detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they joined another detective [Christine Tucci] and his partner, Doberman named Zues who does not get along with Jerry Lee. Dooley also does not get along with his new partner. That everything changes as the movie progresses. The film is intense because it is a guy who really wants to kill Dooley by the way he has dealt with it in the past. There are some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife that do not really seem to be in the tone of the movie because the rest of the film is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes and jokes about dogs biting bandits in a certain area . I know this sounds very low mood, but some of them are actually very funny. I did not see this movie for the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big fan of James Belushi and the second is for the action sequences. James Belushi is funnier than in K-9 and the action sequences are also better. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a fan of James Belushi, you will love this movie.
