Why has not this been released? I kinda thought it should be a bit rubbish since it was not. How wrong can a girl be! This film is, in a word, captivating. <br /> <br /> You will be captivated. It keeps your attention from the beginning and your pace never slows down. <br /> <br /> The final part of the movie, the "episode", so to speak (giving nothing, you saw it in the trailer) is also a must-see. You will choose a favorite, you will be shocked, you will not be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens. Adrenaline increases and you can not watch. Cudos to the actors, it's very believable. And that does not stop there, they have a final shock to you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you question the reality of TV and if you watched. And how far are we really? Endemol (who does the older brother) did a TV show in Holland last year, offering the kidney of a dying woman to patients who need a transplant. The show was revealed in the end as a farce, ostensibly to raise awareness about organ donation, but are we getting too close to comfort?
