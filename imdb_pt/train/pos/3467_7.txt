I still wonder why I watched this movie. Of course, before watching this movie, I practically knew nothing about the Beatles. I did not even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the best ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono and John was murdered. <br /> <br /> VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed it! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight messy accent. This is very important because John and Paul chatting are pretty much the entire movie, although they are taken out to explore more possibilities and to keep watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn perform well, overall. <br /> <br /> The ending was also very clever. I liked how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performance, and then patting your head and making you realize that it would be best if they just left, and ended up with a good grade. My favorite moment is probably the touching roof scene. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this movie to almost everyone. It is a very good way to resolve your curiosity about what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul had just appeared at John's door. Which is probably the main reason for my vision of this film, setting my curiosity about who the Beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.
