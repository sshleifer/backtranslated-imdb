A new side of the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. The superficial thinking of most people about Queen Victoria is from a woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life of mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives the audience a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascension to the throne and early years. Victory of Blunt, both fresh and contained throughout the film. His strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors did well, including Miranda Richardson in what could have been a throwaway role. <br /> <br /> Although this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic moments of "acting," the story is still interesting enough. to make it worth seeing. There are some historical freedoms that have been taken by screenwriting, the film tries to remain faithful to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and real structure of the time period. Set design and costumes are remarkable. <br /> <br /> This film will be greatly appreciated by those attracted by history, by period dramas and by Blunt and other actors. Highly recommend. <br /> <br /> Note: A
