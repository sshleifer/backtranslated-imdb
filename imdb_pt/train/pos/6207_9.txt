I just watched this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hal Hartley fans will not be disappointed! And if you're not familiar with the work of this director ... it does not matter. This movie can definitely stand on its own. I have to go to the second exhibit ... it was amazing I need to see it again - and fast! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. The dialogue is very clever, and Parker Posey's performance is excellent as she plays the title role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the latest feature revisiting the world and characters introduced in the movie Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most salient stylistic feature employs the usual use of the inclined (or Dutch) angle, which can often be seen in Hartley's past works appearing in various short films available in the collection of possible Hal Hartley films from 1994-2004, and The Girl from Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with great propriety on September 11th. Textually, Fay Grim's adventure in this story forms the backdrop against the changed world after September 11, 2001. Without going into big spoilers, I see this work and the world of history as a bravely political and original portrait of the geopolitics that is rarely, if ever, in the foreground in the mainstream of fictional film post-911 (see Syrianna: side note - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in both films ... most interesting, to say the least). Finally, for those intimately connected to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this movie is hilarious, self-conscious and self-referential. That said, Fay Grimm's character starts in the movie, exactly where she was when Henry Fool ended, but at the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience have totally changed and expanded throughout the narrative. What can be in store for the future of Fay and the Fool family ... ?? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
