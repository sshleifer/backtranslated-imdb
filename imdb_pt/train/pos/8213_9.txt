Anyone who witnesses our justice system - or the lack of it will find this film truly satisfying. There were not many shades of gray in relation to characters or plot. Virtually all the characters in this film have synthesized what is best and worst in our society. The popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another had to deal with the scoundrels, along with clumsy bureaucrats, full of lilies and mouth to mouth that empower them in the name of "politicians" . correction. "<br /> <br /> Acting along the line was convincing, and I sympathized with the rape victim-while at the same time I found it gratifying to see her wipe away the arrogant presumption of the faces of her former aggressors. In particular, I found the dock one of the ugliest characters of all the movies I saw, so it was cool to see the ex-victim shut up forever. The rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fair that Dirty Harry himself ridiculed in a grotesque and noisy way at the end.This was the only sequel to Harry's dirty saga that matched the first.
