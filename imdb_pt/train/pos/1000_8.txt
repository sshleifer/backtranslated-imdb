I like the movie. Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well made. I especially liked the opening scene that had a semi truck on it. A very tense action scene that seemed well done. <br /> <br /> Some of the transition scenes were filmed in interesting ways, like time-lapse photography, unusual colors or interesting angles. Also the movie is funny is various parts. I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too. I would give the film an 8 out of 10.
