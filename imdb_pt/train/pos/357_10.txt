The film is extremely nice with a great cast and excellent direction of James Eves. The film is fun with a very charismatic performance of Stephanie Beecham and everyone is perfectly cast. James Eves has a good eye for the cast and directs as a master knowing exactly when to increase the action, fall and then rise to climax. He does this with an element of humor, many twists, emotions and blood. This is a return of the old vampire movie, with lots of blood, blood and screams. The film works at a great speed and the characters take you on a fantastic adventure, but what makes it work is that the film does not take itself too seriously with too much action on the cheek.
