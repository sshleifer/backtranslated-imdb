David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young couple of journalists who want to go to California, but they can not afford to do that, so they share "another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save money. for they stop at various murder sites along the way, where serial killers have done their thing, since Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they do not know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis is a serial killer and a girlfriend who just agrees with whatever he says. I do not care for Pitt as a rule, but he does justice to psychotic roles. The scary thing is that he does them so well, I do know him people like him before, no, not killers, but with the same mentality, anyway, Carrie imagines that others are short on money, but Earley always seems to have money somehow ... never mind that he leaves someone dead here is the I read to do it though Lewis does his role we ll, one she stands out, not a very bright waif who has a good heart, but does not understand that she does not have to put up with being beaten by Earley when she does something that he do not like. When things start to get more unacceptable, Carrie insists that the other couple be put in a gas station, and unfortunately that's where she's in there and she sees a newsletter that tells her exactly who after things go down at a fast pace. This is not the biggest movie in the world, but it's not bad ... I watched what should be the 'unrated' version, but I wonder how much of it was cut from the trial version, because that sounded pretty cool, really. .. not that it makes the family or anything, unless it's maybe the Manson Family. 7 out of 10.
