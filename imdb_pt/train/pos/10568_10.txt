I loved this movie, seen tonight on a big screen cinema! The audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things, and the fast pace was very pleasant. <br /> <br /> I, as a singer and musical director, question a part of Roby Keeler's lead vocals in "By a Waterfall." "The modulated key, and she was suddenly singing much lower, in a very smooth voice that bore no resemblance to the taller twitter voice she wore on all of her other vocals. <br /> <br /> Someone Do you know if this was overdubbed by another singer? That sounds to me.I would love to know. Thank you very much.
