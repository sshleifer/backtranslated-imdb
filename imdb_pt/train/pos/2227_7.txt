This will receive criticism across the map because it does not fit comfortably into any mold. It's horror, but it's not a splatterfest. It's also part of Suspense as well as Horror - still without the usual Hollywood shouts and jerky camera. <br /> <br /> The feel of the movie is free and without special effects because I think you should listen and observe the faces of the characters. <br /> <br /> Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe. This is a red herring. He's acting here. 'Camp' is a misreading of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau is giving a solid performance - so she must believe the script has something to say. We all know excuses when the actors just do not care anymore and are just waiting for the director to take "Cut" and receive their payments. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Forgive the fact that bodies begin to fall with almost monumental regularity. I do not think the intention was funny-but to keep it off balance. <br /> <br /> Think of it less as a "horror movie" and more like a horror game on a stage - that decrepit whitewashed house. So you can see that it's really about paranoia, fear and spiraling madness in an isolated location, USA. <br /> <br /> And it's winding. Time Travel, Mind Control, secret experiments and Nazis that CAN NOT be dead. . Yes. <br /> <br /> I say rent it and try it out if you're in the mood for something a bit cerebral. This would be a good choice for a Saturday at midnight.
