This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I watched on DVD, and the disc has no special feature, not even a menu, but that's not necessarily what interests me. <br /> <br /> I often judge films on a case-by-case basis, depending, among other things, whether it's a big studio production or a smaller movie. This is a smaller movie and I am willing to forgive minor things. Having said that, I believe you have one of the most imaginative and original title sequences I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance of all the main players. I especially liked Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character played by Claire Forlani may seem unrealistic to some people, but I personally have met real people with emotional issues who readily look at the decisions of life as her character does. It helped me to capture the nuances of where his sorrows might come through the veneer of his mood. <br /> <br /> This is not a kid's movie, of course, but it DOES NOT involve free sex and nudity. There is a bit of adult language, but sometimes it can be very funny. (In particular, the character of Alan Arkin, who can not even swear correctly.) <br /> <br /> Pay attention also to the appearances of well-known characters.
