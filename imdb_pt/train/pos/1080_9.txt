The "comedies" of movies nowadays are usually 100 minutes of humor in the bathroom, foul language and kicks in the groin. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the slow and slow of the brain. Of course, a good occasional comedy will come along but they are becoming more and more rare. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" shows what the 1940s Hollywood was capable of, and it's just frighteningly funny. Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the suburbs of Connecticut. The film follows its story, beginning with the house hunting trips, the cluttered construction of the house, to the finished house - with its "zuzz-zuzz water softener". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are perfect for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny as he watches the costs of the house zooming out). However, the film is stolen by the wise lawyer of the Blandings, played to perfection by Melvyn Douglas. Stealing all the scenes in which he is, Douglas is hilarious as he watches the Blandings stagger from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as the tormented architect of the Blandings and Harry Shannon as the old water well driller are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie several times and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good movie to watch when you need an elevator, whether you're building a house or not.
