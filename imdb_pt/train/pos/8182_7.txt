Director Brian Yuzna had an uneven career in the horror genre, creating masterpieces like "Return of the Dead Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator", but at the same time made horrible movies like "Faust: Love". for the Damned, or the mediocre Progeny. <br /> <br /> He's obviously better at Producer's headquarters where his work producing the Stuart Gordon films was superb. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is one of his works director, but the low profile that benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes for a very enjoyable experience. It tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone (played superbly by Corbin Bernsen), a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not as perfect as he thought when he discovered that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) had a case with the pool boy.This event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing when he takes revenge on the world for being so " dirty. "<br /> <br /> The premise is very well handled by Yuzna as he takes us on a tour following Feinstone's revenge day. What makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective, we followed Feinstone by he is the main character. We witnessed him move from respected professional to psychopath in one day. Yuzna manages to give the film the exact amount of suspense, but adds a good deal of dark humor that really helps the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the success of the premise lies in Bernsen's performance as Feinstone. It can make you feel sympathy and hatred towards him at the same time, and the subtle humor that your character has is another aspect that helps the movie. The rest of the cast is not so good, and I think its sub-par acting harms the movie more than it should. One notable exception is Ken Foree, as the detective trying to get Feinstone. Although his part is very small, he does a great job with it. <br /> <br /> With a dentist as a killer, bloody scenes are expected, and Brian Yuzna delivers a great SFX in the right amount. It's good to see that he's not over the top like he usually does, and I dare say that's a highlight of the movie. It has the exact amount of blood that is expected, nothing less and nothing more. Yuzna restrained herself from her common excesses and the result is great. <br /> <br /> Although this is not among the best known films of Yuzna, I would say that it is one of his best. Of course, it's not classic material like his masterpieces, but it's a entertaining film that never becomes tiring or boring. It's a simple low budget movie, but for what it is, I think it was too much. 7/10
