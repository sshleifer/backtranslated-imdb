Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one with an unfortunate Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially stage dances in a purest form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before learning to make the most of the movie's potential. Best of all: seeing Burns and Allen before their radio / TV husband / wife comedy career, doing the kind of dance they must have done in Vaudeville and did not get a chance to do in their college movies of the 1930's Paramount. (George was once a tap dance instructor). His two numbers with Fred are high points of the movie, and are worth waiting for. The first trio of soft sneakers is a warm-up for the thrilling number of carnival in which the three sing and dance for toys and other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. The fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth to endure the "plot". I've seen this 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button useful.
