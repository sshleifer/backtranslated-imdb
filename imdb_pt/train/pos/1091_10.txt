I loved this movie I first saw it when I was 20 (it was only four years ago) and I really enjoyed it, I brought my own copy the next day. The comedy is well interpreted by all involved. I always have to step back and review the scene in which Mr. Tsanders explains why he found water at 6 feet in one area and 227 feet in another area. Also look for Jason Robards father who plays Mr. Retch. Talent ran in this family.
