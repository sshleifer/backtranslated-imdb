Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite TV shows: I used to watch daily episodes when I got home from school. So far I think I watched all the episodes at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teen / witch with normal teenage problems that we can all relate to. She is funny, intelligent, outgoing, witty and more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick fit very well as Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda, the crazy and crazy, make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Although I must agree that college years are not as good as their high school years, but that does not mean they are not good yet. I think the ending was incredible, although it was not what I expected, it made sense and I loved it anyway. :)
