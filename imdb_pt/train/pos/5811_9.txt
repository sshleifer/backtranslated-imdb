Just a 9/10 of me, a perfect ten would have been if there had been more than one plot to the movie, but nevertheless, Moonwalker to this day remains a fun fest of music, dance and entertainment. Beginning with Jackson's long-running video clip set-up, this reminds the viewer why he is often considered the "King of Pop." From his hit 'I Want You Back' to 'We Are the World', the charity album winning several awards for the benefit of Africa. After that, a short film of sorts, though lacking glare in an Oscar-winning screenplay, is nevertheless a fantastic and entertaining drama for the public. Finishing off with a perfect (sexy!) Version of 'Come Together'. Something the whole family can watch and enjoy.
