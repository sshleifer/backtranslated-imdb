An unusual movie by Ringo Lam and one that is strangely underrated. The blend of fancy kung-fu with a more realistic depiction of swords and spears being driven through bodies is surprising especially during the first ten minutes. A rider is cut in two and his waist and legs continue to ride the horse. Several horses are chopped. It's very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Shaolin brothers are captured by a crazed general maniac and imprisoned in the Red Lotus Temple, which seems to be more of a torture chamber than a temple. The general bears a resemblance to Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, while bubbling over the distorted philosophy and making scary paintings with human blood. <br /> <br /> The production is very impressive and the scenery is bleak. Blood is everywhere. The action is very well done and, most of the time, consistent, unlike many HK action scenes of the era. Sometimes the movie turns into nonsense or the effects are cheesy, but it's never bad enough to ruin the movie. <br /> <br /> Find this, it's one of the best kung fu movies of the early nineties. Just remember that it is not for children.
