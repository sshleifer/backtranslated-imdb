Joan Fontaine is "A Maiden in Peril" in this 1937 musical starring Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The plot, what about him, is about a British woman (Fontaine) in love with an American, who is mistaken for Astaire, a musical comedy. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by George Stevens, contains some wonderful songs from Gershwin, including "Good work if you can" and "A foggy day". The best scene is the number "Stiff Upper Lip", which happens in an amusement house. <br /> <br /> Astaire's voice sounds stronger in this movie than in others, and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers. Burns plays his big publicist and Allen is Burns' secretary. She's hilarious. The problem, as others have pointed out, is Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot, and occurs between the trees. I would have thought it was a double, except that the dance was so bad. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing, despite its flaws.
