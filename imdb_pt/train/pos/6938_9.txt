For the viewer who tackles it long after it was created, "Winchester '73" has something in common with "Casablanca". As you watch, you get the feeling that you are seeing a series of cliches found so often in the genre; so you realize that the clichés became clichés only after being copied from this particular movie, and that they were copied so broadly because that movie was so good. In other words, it's a seminal work. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73 is a joy to watch. The plot lines are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you saw them copied so many times in later movies, and yet it contains a number of twists that surprise you. Mann's dialogue, pace and direction are excellent. Stewart shines privately, and if you are a fan this is a "must-see", but he is not alone in delivering a good performance. Remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and / or witty lines go to minor characters. Because this makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cutouts, it lent additional realism to the film. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly underrated movie, and it pays to keep an eye out. The DVD also contains an interview with Stewart, who provides some information about the film.
