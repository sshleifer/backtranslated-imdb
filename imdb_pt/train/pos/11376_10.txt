This has to be one of the best movies about serial killers I've ever seen, and this comes from someone who absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs. HBO hit the jackpot here. This movie is compelling from the first moment until the last. <br /> <br /> This film has so many underlying themes that it's hard to say exactly what it's all about. He chronicles the quest for a decade by Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced forensic expert who is in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sutherland gives an even more engaging performance as his cynical superior, and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him. Both his performances are subtle masterpieces - Rea starts naive and does not want to compromise, while Sutherland gets detached and almost has fun with the situation. In the end, Rea becomes more tired of the world and beaten by the system, while Sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other film, I would have said that Sutherland's performance stands out above the rest. , but here it is rivaled by Jeffrey DuMann, as the serial killer himself. DuMann brilliantly creates a character here that inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we would find - he's a monster, but he does not want to be, and we have the idea that he's as disgusted with what he does as we are. He is tortured, ashamed, but also vicious. <br /> <br /> If you can catch the incredibly obscure subject, (and this is * very * disturbing) then you should see this movie.
