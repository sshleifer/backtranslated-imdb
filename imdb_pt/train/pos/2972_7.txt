I must admit that I'm a big fan of South Park and I hoped the basketball was funny, but not nearly as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker together. This movie has a lot of replay value and in no time bother to take it seriously. The humor of the slap stick style mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The type of humor present in basketball was not popular at the time of its launch and if it were released today would be a success. Do not worry about trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and wait for infinite laughs to come. Recommended for anyone with a good sense of humor.
