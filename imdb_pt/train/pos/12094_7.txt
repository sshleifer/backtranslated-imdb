Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre that is being released in Italy in the 60's. The film has all the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most of the movies worth it. <br /> <br /> The story is about a haunted castle. People visited, but none returned. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night at the castle and return to collect his winnings. But the night he visits is a special night. It is the night every year when the dead return to relive their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only flaw I see in the movie is the runtime. Almost looks padded. There is a large part of the first act, where literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbles in the dark without finding anything of interest. But once he finds something, the movie begins and becomes quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The Blood Castle is a definite must for fans of Steele and for fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.
