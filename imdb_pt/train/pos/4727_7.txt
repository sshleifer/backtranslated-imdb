I was pleasantly surprised to have really enjoyed this movie. Spirited writing (some "inner" jokes that I have, others I did not do - maybe due to actors speaking one on top of the other), great acting (notably John Cassini), great cameos, interesting and unique direction. I rented to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed that he was in such a short time, blink and you will miss him!), But found the film remarkably entertaining. I'll watch it again before sending it to Netflix. I think actors and actors want to enjoy this movie. The ending is a bit expected, but I wish they had done something different (and more positive). Too bad the film was not better received, except in the "festival" market. I suggest this to anyone who loves the acting business.
