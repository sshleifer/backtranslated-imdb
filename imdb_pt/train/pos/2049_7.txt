This movie is very tacky, but I give credit at least for trying to provide some characterization for its principles. There are some great moments in the movie and the dialogue also has some great moments. <br /> <br /> The air-raid sequence is perhaps the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> I think I really like the idea of ​​how long a veteran will go to a veteran colleague. Of course it's not that well done, but the premise is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Tom
