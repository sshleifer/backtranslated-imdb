Shintarô Katsu, best known for the films Zatôichi, again stars in the third and final Kenji Misumi film (mainly known as "Lone Wolf and Cub") directed by Hanzo 'The Razor' Itami, with the big ninjas battling, raping 'ghosts' , and discovering obscure things in the treasure of the shogunate. Hanzo's plot was getting kind of boring and repetitive. What used to be romance in the first film was no longer. Fortunately, this was better than the second. thanks for having more humor.I'm glad they choose to stop in the trilogy one (I'm looking at you Lucas) <br /> <br /> My Grade: B <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Merely Trailers for all 3 Hanzo the Razor movies <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aoi Nakajima looses both breasts, Mako Midori just the left
