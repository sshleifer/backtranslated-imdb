I finally watched these episodes in 2008 and had to continually come back and check when they were actually produced. They are absolutely scary in that they made the point in fun of what the future would be. Either Parker and Stone lived in Texas and witnessed the idiocy of Gov Bush or it's those weird and strange people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! The Bush brothers invading the White House dressed as Arabs wielding rifles? Bush "accidentally" running someone? (No, wait, he kind of did it as governor.) This may have seemed like a serial failure at the time, but now it's to be considered a brilliant, albeit scary, prescience.
