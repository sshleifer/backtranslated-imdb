Having never heard of this movie until I saw the DVD rented as a little skeptical, there have been many movies in the past with good casting that can not do anything filming a bad script, and in some cases do not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Well, having just watched, there was no reason not to give this film a theatrical version, it's good. The story like most in this genre may seem a bit forced at times, but there seems to be a fair amount of realism here as well, which allows the momentum to continue. I was pleasantly surprised at how good Justin Timberlake works here too with such an important role, OK he's not Oscar stuff yet but he will learn from every role and he shows a lot of promise for the future here. Dylan McDermott was also surprisingly good in his unexpectedly unpleasant role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, just give it a try. you will not be disappointed, you will not be bored, in fact, I think you will be more than happy with the end result.
