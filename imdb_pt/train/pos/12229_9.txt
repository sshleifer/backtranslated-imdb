For me, there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low-budget science fiction. As a child in the 50's is all there was. In 1957, I saw "The First Man in Space" at a movie theater with my father. There was Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor guys who got the lead role. It's also about a space mission that went awry where the astronaut turns into a gray-haired killer. It frightened the good and the fullness of me. The memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives inside me. The Incredible Melted Man is almost a re-shoot only in full glorious color ... it's wherever the scenes are well lit. I just have to love what is ...... a little more than an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noises and that mysterious music. Angry!
