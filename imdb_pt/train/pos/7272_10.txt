Before you begin, let me tell you how fantastic this special sound is when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time (Red Mountain in particular). So while watching this stand-up special, I suggest - no, DEMAND you do that. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia takes his position to the extreme in San Francisco, California. There, he makes fun of everyone with absolutely no apologies. <br /> <br /> I'm thanking God here that Carlos did not do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over again. again. He does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and, at the same time, is sincere about it; I know sometimes I said, after Carlos said a joke: "Damn, this guy makes a good argument!" And then the Game Over screen appeared on my TV because I forgot I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So, yes, there is nothing to complain about this particular stand-up. If you have TiVo or something, please do yourself a favor and record this historic time.
