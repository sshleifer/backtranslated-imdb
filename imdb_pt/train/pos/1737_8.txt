I love Burt Reynolds old movies. They are funnier and better than all the other movies together. They may well have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2," but I think how could they know there would be no more good ones? Dude this movie is good. Burt Reynolds has to dress like a chicken and drive a lot in a race car, and the lush Loni Anderson is at his disposal, looking extremely hot in an eighty way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson announcing a vacuum cleaner. I sure loved this ad! In addition, there's a part in the movie where the public on the dance floor is upset about something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and shows a guy in the audience bowing and pointing his thumb to show his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost spent the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then I never watch another movie, because I tell you now: it does not make sense.
