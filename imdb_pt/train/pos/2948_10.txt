It must be against the law not to try this extremely funny show with Eddie Murphy. I've never seen anything like it. <br /> <br /> Murphy continues for almost 70 minutes on sticks, pussies, breasts and insults from so many famous people, including his own "family." Among the people who get it for Murphy are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I've never laughed so seriously at anything in my life. I mean, when a person does not know who Mr. T is, but he still laughs as much about Murphy as Mr. T, there's something about it. By the time I saw the program, I could not remember who Mr. T., but still laughs. Now I know who he is and it just makes it so much funnier. Because that's what Eddie does - he can make such good prints that no matter who the hell he's trying to do, it's still hilarious. And besides, we've learned that Murphy is a really good singer. Please watch ..
