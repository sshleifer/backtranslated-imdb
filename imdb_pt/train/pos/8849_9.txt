The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently have their act together) and Hank (clearly do not have their act together) need money. Andy presents a scheme to achieve something that will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This movie delivers. This is a layered roller coaster full of blood that knows exactly what it's doing. As a criminal drama / suspense I would be happy to compare it to 'No Country For Old Men'. While both films have a wide range of drama and excitement, 'Devil' is more on the suspense side because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and darker film that you can really admire, while 'Devil' is a little nicer. There is definitely less violence in 'Devil' than 'No Country'. The acting also delivers. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, brings nervousness, perspiration and the look of deer-beacons to the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, like Andy, has the hardest scenes in the film and is fast becoming the actor, who you believe can do anything. <br /> <br /> There really is not much wrong with this movie. He jumps back and forth without being confused. The events are out of control, but the film never does - the writing (of the first timer Kelly Masterson), the direction (the veteran Sidney Lumet) and the edition remain as firm as a drum. In many categories, this is premium caliber thing, although perhaps movies like 'The Departed' and 'No Country' have squeezed this movie out of the limelight. If you liked these, you'll enjoy it.
