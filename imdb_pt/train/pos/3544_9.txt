Guys and Dolls has to be one of my favorite music films of all time. It's a very fun movie to watch and nothing more. it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals were meant to entertain, not to preach. Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago, which are great musicals and good movies, but they can not bring us solid entertainment without strings attached. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can not sing! It was very annoying to hear him sing and speak when I could not understand him. If it was not for Marlon I would have given this 10 stars. Guys and Dolls offers old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days. Watch to have a good time!
