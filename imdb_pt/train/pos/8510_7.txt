This was the eighth and final film of Columbia Whistler and the only one without Richard Dix who retired from the movies and was going to die the following year. Still a competent thriller, the machine continued without him perfectly, but ?? something was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series have always been interesting, sometimes brilliant, often atmospheric, but it was not just Whistler himself who hung everything together on the screen, Dix as well. <br /> <br /> Young A couple dating for a whole fortnight has a desire to get married in the rain but is frustrated when the potential bride disappears and it is discovered that she is already married before she looks crazy. Does the potential groom postpone even when the particular idiot he hired to find her suddenly snags and fucks or is he blinded by love? Who's cheering who the question is. Michael Duane in his penultimate film, okay, if it was a bit weak, Lenore Aubert's best moments in the next Abbott & Costello film, Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only walk in Whistler itself must have gotten wet because of the rain, unless it has been sprayed with sea foam in Voice. <br /> <br /> Much has happened in this last hour, it's worth watching and again as usual for fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series, which began in 1942, continued until 1955, recording about 700 half-hour shows, almost all available on mp3s and based on what I've heard so far, and almost everyone is worth listening to as well.
