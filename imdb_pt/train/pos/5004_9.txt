but so fun and random! Love or hate, but do not expect a sophisticated storyline or keen suspense. Think of it as Seinfeld, but without the accompaniment and repetition of eccentric characters' performances (well ... so far, I have the feeling that I will develop favorites as the season continues). <br /> <br /> "Creature Comfort" is not for the faint of heart - it's to be enjoyed with the least effort on the part of your brain. That's why this show incorporates everything I need into a show when I get home from work at night: shallow conversations in the background with the right amount of "cute" characters for me to enjoy when I eventually look up computer to See what I'm missing. <br /> <br /> Funnier than most sitcoms today, quieter than a night in NASCAR. Just the right mix of dead air and returns. I can not wait for the next one.
