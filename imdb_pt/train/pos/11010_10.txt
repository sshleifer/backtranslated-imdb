When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity, many films were expected to use it as inspiration. This did not really happen, surprisingly, and it took until 2002 for a similar theme movie to appear. But to say that Cypher is a clone would be to your discredit. <br /> <br /> The story is about Morgan Sullivan, who is applying for a job at a high-tech tech company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and get information about a rival company under a false and assumed identity. His home life is perfectly normal, but he needs to lie to his wife about what he's actually doing. However, things begin to take conspiratorial curves and before he knows what is happening, he begins to question who he really is. This is not helped by a strange woman who appears ... <br /> <br /> Turns and turns in all directions leave you absolutely fascinated, and at no time does anything seem artificial or unbelievable. <br /> It is a fascinating journey through a not too distant future, and with good acting throughout the year will keep you at the tip of your seat. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
