I basically like Verhoeven's movie because in his movie, I like a brilliant psycho-sexual story I've seen before in "Wild Instinct." It really is a wonderful thriller that I really enjoyed. So it's obvious to me to see this other Verhoeven movie. Well, it was his previous direction before his blockbuster hit "Wild Instinct" and so I was very curious to watch this movie and yes, the film fulfilled my hope and expectation. <br /> <br /> This movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant psycho-sexual drama that is somewhat complex for some audiences. The story of this movie is about a gay writer named "Reve" (Krabbe), an alcoholic who lives on his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that may warn him of a future accident. After the end of his talk, he introduces a seductive woman named "Christine" who has a mysterious past that she does not want to reveal.Reve to have sex with her in her house as she is a boy.In the next morning he sees the photo of sexy, macho boyfriend at his desk, the person he met at the station. He is curious to meet you and tell Christine to invite you to her house. <br /> <br /> That's it. I do not want to reveal the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie and the end of the movie is really amazing! <br /> <br /> especially, I like the character "Reve" who is brilliantly touched by "Krabbe". basically as his acting, because as a homosexual I am purely identified with his character and yes I like his charming face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr. Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. I rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
