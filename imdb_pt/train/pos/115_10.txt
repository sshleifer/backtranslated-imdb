Subtle art piece. Maybe a masterpiece. Undoubtedly, a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Kafka style tale about the impossibility of victory or survival in a perpetual and strange world. Life is, in this film, just an adaptation exercise. Lesson about limits and original sin, about the fragility of the innocence and error of his ways. <br /> <br /> Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and the same ambiguous woman. And Europe is a symbol of the basic crisis, which has many aspects such as chimerical wars or useless search for truth / essence / golden age. <br /> Metaphor or parable, the film is history of evolution disappointed. War, peace, business or lie are just details of gelatin time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love, a convention. The method of sacrifice only to hope to understand a painful reality.
