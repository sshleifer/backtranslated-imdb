This is one of my all time favorites. It's so simple and sweet - definitely a romantic romantic comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes and it has ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters "You're thinking what I'm thinking" and Ed says "Now what are the chances of that happen "In my opinion, a movie is fabulous, if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of pleasure from it, and with this, you can! I also really liked the way Walter M.s portrayed Einstein. I think all the characters fit very well and the story flows very well. There are so many times that I see myself smiling along with the movie and quoting my favorite phrases while I watch! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a romantic comedy feeling good from time to time!
