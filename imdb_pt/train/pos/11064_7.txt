"I'll Take You There" talks about a helpless man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is, for the most part, an ironic comedy featuring Rogers and Sheedy with little emphasis on romance. A kind of road trip with lots of fun and a few poignant moments keeps moving, stays cool and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers.
