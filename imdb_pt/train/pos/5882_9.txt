In Mexico, this movie was only shown on pay-TV. The life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a true example of a good German and especially of a good man. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are especially interesting. A real war of ideas: two different Germans, both with faith there. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, church man and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is exceptional as Bonhoeffer. I highly recommend this movie, especially at this difficult time for the planet. In Mexico, we do not know much about the life and legacy of Pastor Bonhoeffer, this is a great job to rescue a forgotten hero.
