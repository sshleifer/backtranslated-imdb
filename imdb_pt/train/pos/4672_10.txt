I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and I loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen of Alaska parole back to his family in Brooklyn. He appears there because his brother died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his relations with the wife and son of his brother and father, who never forgave him for being the black sheep of the family. History takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to understand more deeply the complexity of their lives. In addition, the pictures of the joinery business and the Brooklyn setting set the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
