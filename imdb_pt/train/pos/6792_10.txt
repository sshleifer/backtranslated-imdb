I remember that game. He was always sitting on the shelves alone, until one day I decided to try something new for a change, and I got this game. I looked with admiration, since it was the first game for the PS1 that I owned that had 4 discs. When I played, I could not put the control on the floor, seriously. <br /> <br /> The plot of this game is so good and fuzzy, it's almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII Storyline, and this is difficult. accomplish. When you play the game, you get so caught up in the characters that it's unbelievable that it's just a PS1 game because it looks like a movie. And I believe this must be done in a movie. <br /> <br /> Pity that this game is an unprecedented game and almost nobody played or liked it, since it is one of those games in which it is sitting. the ends of the shelves, with a 50% sign, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at the ones who are in the end, and try them on, and most of them look really good. Hell, that's how I got into the final Fantasy VII, looking in a catalog and finding it. But this is different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games, surprisingly. I would not be surprised if it was done by Square Enix, but it is not. Almost every game I play is better than the Final Fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is. But what really bothers me is why it is very little known and not praised, what it should be. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? He is the man of PS1, made in 1999. The history that I already mentioned is incredible, almost surpasses VII. The characters are incredible, you become very involved with them and their actions. <br /> <br /> We defined 10 out of 10. We definitely deserve more compliments, and a very well made RPG by a company other than Square Enix. .
