You are waiting to see if the remake is better or worse. I rated Audie Murphy's movie as 3 (I'm a tough grad), the second lowest I've ever given Audie (the worst is "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this movie a rating of "8" (and I'm a hard grader) It's the Civil War story of renegade "soldiers", if you want to call them like that, against the North. People like Quantrell and the men who rode with these thugs. The original was a watery version, with a very clean cut, while still depicting the horror of what these men were doing. In fact, movies like the older version are best viewed by mature audiences, who can discern the story. I'd be more apt to evaluate the original "R" and this, with its rude nature, a GP, because the latest movie gives a very honest version, a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older version. <Br /> Filmmakers since the early sixties boast of "realism," but few offer. Instead, they only give the monotonous scenery, monotonous outfits and monotonous events, but with comic cardboard stereotypes, the weakness of the spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers realized this error. It is evident in a superior western style that we usually see today. This movie is an example. It gives the settings realistic, but also gives us characters that we can believe exist at that time. <br /> <br /> He has some lulls, which makes him feel a bit harsh, and has some unexplained situations. But unexplained situations are good as long as the whole movie holds up, and the characters are intriguing enough. <br /> <br /> It starts a bit exaggerated, but it really improves. The main character is the one we can identify and at least have some sympathy for. Audie Murphy's character in the first film does not really evoke sympathy, and is very selfish without motivation. <br /> <br /> The character in this film follows the lines of a true anti-hero. There is motivation and a method for your madness. We never feel that he is really "right", but we can understand where he comes from. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in the movie. There is also some humor. A good scene is when the heroine tells the hero that she would not lie to him, and he ponders it. <br /> <br /> This film manages to do what filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This director and team of writers got it right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Full success.
