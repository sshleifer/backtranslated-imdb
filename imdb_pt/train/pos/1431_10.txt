This is simply the most amazing movie you will see. I thought it was just another documentary, but it's something else. He does not try to teach you anything, it shows how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about the quality of the images because obviously you know of other reviews that is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> The Earth is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and with what treasure we have been blessed, but we do not appreciate it at all. /> <br /> This film should be shown compulsory in schools. It's the most wonderful movie you've ever seen, so go and see. Who knows, maybe it's the last time we can see our planet like this ... 10/10, but I'd easily rate it more if it were possible.
