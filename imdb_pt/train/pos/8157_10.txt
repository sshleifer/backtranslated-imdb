Rated R for Strong Language, Violent Content and Some Nudity. Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> The fear of a black hat is one of the funniest, most original comedies I have ever seen. It is basically a gangsta rap version of the movie This Is Spinal It's a shame that many people have never heard of this movie gem. If you can find this movie anywhere, do not hesitate to buy it, even if you do not like rap music. There are not many comedy movies that I give a perfect 10/10 to. The only ones I can think of at the moment are this movie, Clerks, The World According to Garp, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Chasing Amy. This movie is a hilarious stereotype of gangsta rap The movie is about a woman named Nina Blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group NWH (N **** z with hats). They are basically the stereotype of a rap group doing a lot of songs from controversial rap about killing and being a gangsta.Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedy movie and I recommend it even if you are not a fan of gangsta rap scene. It's a pity that this movie is not in the Top 250. <br /> <br /> Duration: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
