A sweet little movie that would not even offend his grandmother, "Saving Grace" seems to have been cut in the same way as half a dozen other British comedies in the last two years ... the oppressed faces adversity, finds the strength to challenge and challenge . learn something about him / herself in the process. <br /> <br /> Widowed and so broke, Grace is a master gardener, and is recruited to help his friend / servant Matthew cultivate his marijuana plant. He's doing everything wrong, so Grace helps him. They realize that she is the perfect person to harvest the pot, from which both can benefit. He likes to smoke, he needs to raise funds to pay his mortgage. Grace travels to London to trade some of her merchandise, dressed in what appears to be the white suit that John Travolta wore on "Saturday Night Fever," and thus coming off as a sore thumb . <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always watchable, and you can not say that about many people ... well, I can not, anyway. Ferguson is very good, and Tcheky Karyo, who I enjoyed in "La Femme Nikita", is memorable. <br /> <br /> Not deeply exciting or insightful, but immensely fun, and at a fast pace of 90 minutes, it seems like a walk with friends. 8/10
