Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought this was going to be some kid's dumb movie, and TOTALLY it was not. It was so incredibly fun for EVERYONE, adults and kids. I saw it once because it was almost out of theaters, and now it's finally coming to DVD on this Tuesday and I'm very excited as you can see. you should definitely see if you have not already, it was so good! <br /> <br /> Liz
