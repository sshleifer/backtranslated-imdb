The late Robert Bloch (author of PSYCHO, for those of you who were not paying attention) wrote this tale of terror and was absolutely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen as a child. (I had to walk MILES just to watch a movie, and it was usually dark when I left the theater; seeing a horror movie was always unnerving, but particularly when it was as well executed as this one.) When I had the opportunity to see it several years ago in videotape (which should always be a last resort), I was surprised at how well it stayed. Take the terror test: watch the night, alone, and THEN tell me it's not scary ...
