this movie is not pornographic, it was not meant to be pornographic, and unless my uncle competes for the president of the world, it should never be considered pornographic. <br /> <br /> Now that this issue has been resolved, I can say I fully recommend this movie because the problems are still widely available. It's funny, the acting is great and raises serious (curious) questions. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why this movie was so mistreated, which is probably why I plan to never visit the US. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern grotesque movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are its main attributes, she occasionally gets angry, but are not we all?
