I usually avoid TV movies because of the many ways you know they are TV movies five seconds later. This drew my attention because of the unusual title and his dark and well-drawn humor that is established from the beginning. While the ever-present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misguided story (even claiming to be set in California, the film was largely filmed in a stormy Vancouver, BC), the dark and oppressive billboard beautifully complements Olmos's excellent performance.
