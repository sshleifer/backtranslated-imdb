When I saw this movie, I was impressed by the great movie it was. This is the only movie I think I would give a rating of 10 stars. I'm sure this movie will always be in my top 5. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I do not think anyone could have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can not decide what to rent, well, this is the only one. You will love all the acting, special effects and more. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen this movie, rent or buy now !!! You will not regret. <br /> <br />
