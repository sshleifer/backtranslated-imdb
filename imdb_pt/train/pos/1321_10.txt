Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like a compelling feature. The Forbidden Lie (2007) is simply a better (cinematographic) version of Norma Khouri's Forbidden Love, and THAT was a bestseller. A lie of literary fraud and a beautiful woman, Lie $ is the best of television's editorial reality. <br /> <br /> Cleverly edited and colored, Broinowski's narrative is covered up by moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri blowing significantly smoke. I disagree (with Variety) who is overlong; instead, my only problem was with the episodic nature of its main participants, commenting on the newly recorded testimonials. All at once, your sense of narrative becomes bogged down ..... so I watched it twice. <br /> <br /> This Oscar-worthy effort is both genuinely funny, disturbing and totally captivating, as it documents a lie. after another. The apparent com has unfolded in the Australian state of Queensland through very personal frauds of friends and fans of Khouri (!). Clearly, these friends are now "turned," the funniest line on the camera belonging to Khouri's QLD neighbor Rachel Richardson, who talks about her disappointment in meaningless colloquialisms: "I think it's a burden of sh! T. Personally" . <br /> <br /> We need to learn from your experience, hence my belief in spoilers. Any perennial liar caught in a lie will just say anything to gain time to tell another lie. <br /> <br /> There are some breathtaking scenes of Khouri laughing ironically at this documentarist, who instead repeatedly presses his "artist" for corroboration. Since her arrest by Sydney Morning Herald reporters, Caroline Overington and David Knox, a year after the publication, Khouri is outlawed, but was tempted to return to the director to supposedly clear his name. She fled supposedly because: a) or she is afraid of the astute husband, more Italian than Greek, or b) because she needed a passport / visas to clear her name. <br /> <br /> Unlikely. A more plausible reason was that the FBI regained its trail in Queensland before it jumped again abroad (a guess: no, not Jordan). According to a card closing, Khouri is "still under investigation by the FBI" in 2007. <br /> <br /> I imagined that the audience could give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for greater secret and subterfuge. Instead, the audience I sat in slowly became as disillusioned as the people cheated on the screen. Once they picked it up, there was a lot of annoyance and booing; Earlier, shrill voices emanated from audience members who simply did not know how to take Khouri's contradictions. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker sticks so wonderfully around this complicated tale from start to finish, leaving nothing out. - not even his self-sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Anna opens her film with a delightful narrative of Khouri's own books. The reason for its authorship is very convincingly recounted at first glance - fundamental to the functioning of a lifelong liar: in half truths. Khouri is, however, a very handsome and intelligent 35yr-old man with rather disarming, and surprisingly, bicep-crafted charm. <br /> <br /> Gradually, we are introduced to less and less adventurous Aussie journos, editors and fans who first bought the length of Khouri's murder, line, and lead accusations. Later we see his most regretful, self-controlled and trivial reactions, if any perhaps a little bit bitter. <br /> <br /> It was the (anti) Jordanian honor killers who resented more of Khouri's fallacies because their marijuana forced them to slow the pace of change. Honor killings occur in Jordan; it is only its prevalence that is at odds with Khouri's book - plus 72 other "facts". In 2003, these activists faxed the (Australian) Random House, with 73 objections meticulously verified. <br /> <br /> Publishers from 4 continents who took the chance to publish the first author Khouri never tried to verify facts. Leaving no corroboration for a notice in the author's contract, they were also fair game. So it was as easy to impose a massive fraud on the subject in the world as to type in Internet cafes. <br /> <br /> We were later shocked to discover that the "factual errors" extend to Khouri's biography. good. For one thing, she not only is not a 35 year old virgin (her defense is that she just did not let people off her assumptions), but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers! Sometimes she speaks very fast in her American accent. She also looks very comfortable with cell phone technology and Western clothing. I realize that observations like these may sound harmful to Jordanian women who do not need my Western paternalism, but when even cultural suggestions do not match Khouri's "facts," you have to start questioning your source. . <br /> <br /> At some point, the filmmaker came to the same conclusion. She makes an admirable effort to personally hold Khouri in Jordan. The last third is consumed with a return journey to Amman, where one "fact" after another falls. Eventually Broinowski forces his (con) "Artist" to admit the discrepancy of the decade in his story, and it is after that that Khouri records his secret confession in his own digital camera. Secret, because in Khouri's "American security guard," Jeremy is heard with an Australian accent: he's an actor! (We never find out how Anna figured it out.) <br /> <br /> So this becomes the filmmaker's triumph since it never signals in his tone or commitment. His on-camera revelations prompted his audience to learn from the mistakes of others, given a litany of reasonable doubt, FBI documents - and Khouri's most shocking initial crime. Anna Broinowski (watch her now) is smart enough to use the artistic device (the main players commenting scenes) to kill two birds - making her audience want to drink from the same pit again. her deceptively modest approach, she made me re-confirm that Overington and Knox actually won their 2004 Walkleys in Investigative Journalism for their "Research Standard Khouri." <br/> <br/> Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.
