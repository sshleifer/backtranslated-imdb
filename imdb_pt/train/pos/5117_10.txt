Very few movies have had an impact on American culture the way Urban Cowboy has. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class by itself as one of those movies that when you're flipping channels at 3:00 in the morning you just can not take your eyes .... my first three are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but this is next to the point. I remember Urban Cowboy going to theaters, and besides, there were honkytonks being opened around every corner, men wore cowboy hats with loafers, and if you did not know how to take two steps, you were considered a social idiot! Personally I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me in the jumps of SatNiteFever. Who would have a thump? He's really believable, too. The soundtrack is incredible. Too bad that Charlene Tilton, of Dallas' fame on TV, ruined Johnny Lee's career because this guy was just fantastic. The show thief here is Scott Glenn as the ex-cowboy with redneck shoe shines. And I have nothing against greaser ex-travestis of semi-cowboys being one myself, but I always envied what I feel to be the greatest power line of all time ... "Pack-at S * # t!" Sort of like "Make My Day" by Clint. And watching him hit Sissy is the closest thing I'll ever see in my Julia Roberts costume so ... Like I said, gorgeous. 9/10
