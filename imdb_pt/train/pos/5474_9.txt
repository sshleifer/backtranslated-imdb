The National Gallery of Art hosted the original, uncut and uncut version of this film on July 10, 2005. It restores vital scenes cut out by the censors after its release. The cobbler's character, an individual of moral goodness in the original censored version of 1933, is here presented as a follower of the philosopher Nietsze and urges her to use men to make her way to the top. In addition, the playful ending of the original, which I assume is in the current versions of VHS, is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form. A wonderful film of seduction and power. Hopefully, there will be a reprint of this movie on DVD so that everyone can appreciate its great qualities. Look for it.
