I loved the movie. beautifully analyzes the petty-bourgeois Italian society, as the leftists of the 70s gave up all their ideals and came to a happy arrangement that they do not want to disturb. For example, the old psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son, and does not want to be reminded of his most radical youth. <br /> <br /> For a long time I wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on TV, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market even in Italy nobody in the bookstores knew about the movie . a great shame. <br /> <br /> The only sex scene, that everyone seems to have done, does not hurt the movie.
