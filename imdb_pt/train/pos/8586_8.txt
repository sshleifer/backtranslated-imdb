Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. It's been a long time since you've appeared in a movie, and what a movie that was, it was nothing to write home about, but very intriguing, especially with a professional like Michael Douglas in the lead as the secret service agent in distress. The character of Kiefer is the one who chases Michael Douglas the entire movie, Kiefer's partner, is Eva Longoria, the desperate woman. wow, she can really act beyond flirting all day and be fine, I wish Kim Bassinger had a bigger role, but other than that, I really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish. This movie is what I consider a political thriller, everyone did their part to the end. nothing was revealed to stay in the movie so as to keep him guessing at all times. and I really think Kiefer did a job here in this movie, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas did the performance for the day, "I like it."
