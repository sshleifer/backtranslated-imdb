The film exposes the blatant exploitation of the Chinese worker - usually female - by bringing together images of the Chinese owner who shares his shameless and delusional point of view, his equally shameless and deceived American counterpart, the oppressed workers who receive a voice, and it is of course the drunken Americans wearing beaded necklaces celebrating in New Orleans. The glimmer of hope comes when some Americans are really outraged that people who make their beaded necklaces get paid $ 0.10 an hour to do it. You also have the feeling that workers may have the chance to escape working at the bead factory, but they will probably do so when they get tired of the popular punishment treatment among factory owners and / or get too tired to work. to 20 hours a day of hard work. <br /> <br /> I wondered where those necklaces came from, not realizing how exhausting and arduous it would be to make them. I really enjoyed this movie as it portrays the impact that American indulgence has on something we consider relatively innocuous in our society about people on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's just incredible. And clearly, just the tip of the iceberg!
