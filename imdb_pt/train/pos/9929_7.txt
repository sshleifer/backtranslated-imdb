I doubt much of this movie is based on a true story. At first, it says based on a true story, more or less. I bet the only truth is that there was a former model who became a bounty hunter, possibly named Domino. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it starts with Domino talking to Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is being questioned about what she knows about a $ 10 million theft. Through flashbacks, we see Domino as a child, then as a model, and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter. She basically tells 2 other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They let her join the group. She is tough, can use any type of weapon and use her good looks if necessary. <br /> <br /> They get involved in a fraud that Clarmont, a salesman, is doing. Along the way, the group begins a reality show, and that's where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green get involved. They are like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was fun and had some laughs. The issue did not bother me. There is also a lot of violence, especially using weapons and blood. It could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Good enough to watch.
