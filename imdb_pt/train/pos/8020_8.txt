I thought this would be the Muppets' most enjoyable film because I felt it was the happiest and had the best comic book delivery on most of its lines. The Muppets try to go to Broadway to sell an original musical that they wrote, but along the way, they are faced with the usual problems, including Kermit's memory loss here. While there are not as many great appearances here as in the original "Muppets Movie" there are some including Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. Simply the timing and delivery of so many lines are great, and the situations in which the Muppets meet are hilarious. The original songs are also good here, and the ending is satisfying. There's not much else to say about the movie, but Muppet fans should be sure of that. It's the funniest movie in the Muppets and it sure will be appreciated by everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 of ****
