Attractive Marjorie (Farrah Fawcett) lives in fear after being approached by a lone biker. She is mortally shaken by the fact that her abuser knows her address. As expected, Joe (James Russo), the attacker forces his way to Marjorie's house and subject her to humiliating terror. Crushed and bloody, Marjorie manages to control her attacker, knocking the daylight off and leaving him helpless thanks to the wasp spray on his eyes and throat. Hog got bogged down and beat up, Joe tries to explain himself to Marjorie's roommates (Diana Scarwid and Alfrie Woodard) when they get home. There is almost a pinch of mercy, but it does not come from Marjorie. Should she continue to pay her own punishment? Violence, sexual abuse and difficult language contribute to a classification R. Fawcett really distances himself from the difficult roles that would always tarnish his career. Many compliments to director Robert M. Young.
