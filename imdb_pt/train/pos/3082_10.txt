What is really sad, shows like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are the real reality show, not that garbage that is nothing more than glorified games shows. I think the wave of discontent has been there in recent years with very premature cancellations of countless shows with cult followers. But with the more vocal response from Jericho fans (which I also appreciate) and other shows, the networks may begin to reverse that trend. I'm like the others, I will not support ANY new program until they have a second season. I will then possibly make a decision to watch and follow the DVDs and the online viewing. Until then ABC, you lost me as a bystander to any new show.
