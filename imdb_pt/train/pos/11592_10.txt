My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian fishing ship and said that the film that he most impressed and that stayed in his mind all those 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the eagle. He asked if it was possible to get this for him. I'm sure a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have another 3 months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie. On January 27 he will turn 47 and I wish I could get this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and, as we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
