I saw this movie on TV late night, years ago, but it was a disturbing experience that stayed with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The premise may seem a bit original - due to an earthquake, an underground store of a toxic nerve agent in the hills above a small town is broken, and a microscopic amount of the substance reaches its supply to feed. The inhabitants of the city begin to lose their ability to exercise restraint on every caprice and basic desire that floats through all our minds from time to time, and we usually know that we simply should not act. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film is slow, but for me it only increased the discomfort when the behavior of the population begins to unfold slowly. There are several surreal and very disturbing scenes that have remained etched in my memory all this time. <br /> <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we could all be able to give in to our fiercest instincts. I enjoyed that? I'm not sure if "liking" is the right word. Did that make me think? Definitely. I'm still thinking about it. Scary stuff.
