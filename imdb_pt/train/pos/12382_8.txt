Here's a decent horror movie in the mid-'70s about a Hell's Gate in New York that happens to be an old sandstone building. It seems like there are a lot of Hell Gates out there, but of course this unintended model decides she needs a little space for her boyfriend / girlfriend and therefore chooses one, disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment. She meets several strange neighbors and even watches a birthday party for a cat. When meeting with the realtor, because she hears strange noises at night on the upstairs, she discovers that she and an old priest are supposed to be the only tenants. Wow!! So who are all these weirdos? His boyfriend (a slippery lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) starts snooping around and finds out that things are not what they seem, not at all. This has some decent scary scenes and the idea of ​​old people who are "sometimes" neighbors being different from what seem to be quite intriguing. A bit of decent gore and even a parade of less-than-normal people in the end make this a decent watch, and while I've seen this often on TV the uncut DVD version is much better, of course. It's not a little horror movie, maybe a good addition to "Burnt Offerings". 8 out of 10.
