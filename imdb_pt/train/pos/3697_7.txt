I got this movie on the Sundance Channel late afternoon. You can say that "Who Loves the Sun" is a pastime of a story, why never. You get to go out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (returning after abruptly leaving all years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we find out she is part of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is Daniel (he is friend or foe or fianc√©e ), by scenic Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colors against sunlight and shadows. And supporting the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson is the mother Mary Bloom and R.H. Thomson is the father Arthur Bloom. Writer and director Matt Bissonnette has made an ingenious unfolding of the story and its various tentacle links - do not worry, Haas may have an 'inattentive' face, but the mood will come when Parker and Scott enter the circle of friends reunited, ironic smiles Breaking and know delights shake. Dialogues can be concise or even null, but we would have the taste of what you are cooking, confusing or imagining. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Who loves the Sun" may well be categorized as a sleeping gem. The chemistry between the five principles holds gel and 'combustion', giving an energetic performance. After all, it's all family, and the film certainly does not take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> It seems that the official website is still available at "wholovesthesun.com" and there is information about the soundtrack. by Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitar and string songs), where scores of scores are being played, and production notes behind the scenes, interview with screenwriter, director and producer Bissonnette about how the film and concept came about, the cast and more . I have always enjoyed Molly Parker since her spare and fascinating 1996 performance, Lynne Stopkewich's Kissed, and she is married to Bissonnette, who "wrote Maggie's part to Molly."
