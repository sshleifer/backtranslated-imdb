This movie is incredible. With great characters, especially the old swordsman who can fly in the form of fireball and jump over the trees, this movie tells a classic story of battle between good and evil forces. The final confrontation is especially Breathtaking and the score is kind of cool. <br /> <br /> Very, very recommendable.Not for younger children, however. This deserves a 10.
