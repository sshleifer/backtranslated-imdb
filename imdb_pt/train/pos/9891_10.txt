I rented this movie for the first time many years ago and was completely fascinated by it. Recently, feeling a strange need to revisit some of the few films that I enjoyed immensely in my life, I decided to give Er√©ndira another look. And I'm glad that I did, as I soon discovered that even the passage of time does not have at least numb the brightness of this film. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl (Erendira, played notably by Claudia O'hana - in some ways she looks like Winona Ryder!) who accidentally sets fire to her grandmother's mansion, after which the grandmother, played hypnotically by Irene Popes, forces the girl to a life of prostitution on the road to pay damages. <br /> <br /> The vision is both fascinating and compelling - although, despite the basic premise, it deals with prostitution, taste good free smoking sex content. The story revolves around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact during their stay - which, by the way, is in the rustic part of rural Mexico. <Br/> <br /> The film is very atmospheric, surprisingly puzzling with a decided dream quality. Sometimes it borders on the bizarre, but not to the extent of, say, a David Lynch movie. Also worth mentioning is that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments of previous viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Often, in the background, you hear the sounds of a solitary, calm and melancholy accordion , adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican scene. The cinematography of rural places, many of which are in the desert, is quite superb. <br /> <br /> The movie moves at a good pace, not too fast or too slow, and after each scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it again, just because it makes you want to do this. For me, anyway, it's really so compelling. <br /> <br /> I hope you see the movie in its Spanish version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school and also in college, and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. For example: "The world is not as big as I thought." ("The world is not as big as I thought" - that is, it's a small world.) <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of an old, dusty vintage bottle of wine that, when drunk, is immensely rewarding, however, you are saddened to realize that there are no more bottles like this.
