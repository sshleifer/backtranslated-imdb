I love this show! Mr. Blick, Gordon, and Waffle are cats so different from each other, but they refer to themselves collectively as "brothers." I often find myself trying to imitate the tired, sighing accent of his butler, Hovis, or even Gordon's Scottish neighborhood. There should be more episodes about Kimberly Humana. The episode about cats disguising themselves as pre-teen girls to be admitted to Human Kimberly's pajama party in order to leave their thirsty claws in their favorite drink, Rootbeer, is a hilarious classic. We can not drink beer in our house now without making the voices of the Catscratch or the Hanson brothers of the movie 'Slap Shot'. Classical future. Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
