At the risk of sounding a bit sacrilegious, the first time I'm half inclined to put it on an equal footing with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, considering that Simon Pegg is an undisputed comedy genius, I realize that's a pretty big statement. And to what extent do you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary indicator of whether "Fido" will appeal to you. <br /> <br /> In a way, the comedy begins where 'Shaun' has stopped, except we are back in the 1950s, in the original era of the City of the Dead, a small stereotyped city. Zombie Wars is over and the zombies themselves are becoming better adjusted and useful members of the community. That, then, we are informed from the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a good play on romantic comedy, perhaps? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie lies in its depiction of a respectable neighborhood while maintaining core values ​​while creating a place for the zombies and the special perils they pose. The charm and balance with which he does this is almost perfect. Themes you can expect from a more conventional kitsch comedy will come - the veneer of good, clean life, keeping appearances, repressed emotion, confused paternal values, social decorum and the situation of the alienated individual. <br /> <br /> A story told with a happy heart and great appeal that is brought to life vividly by the strong cast of the film. It's one of those jobs that really shows that everyone involved likes to participate. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly learned about his screenplay must have been ... <br /> <br /> So to conclude, you're likely to enjoy the humor of this movie unless your dad tried to eat it, it.
