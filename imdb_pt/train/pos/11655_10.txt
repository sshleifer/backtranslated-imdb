There are many issues avoided in movies and eating disorders is one of them. This movie shows how it is. It is not glamourized for viewers to enjoy, it is shown with real truth that makes it even more powerful. I only saw it once and this was a few years ago, but I can still remember all about it and how it made me feel. It is a very powerful film and is a good support for those suffering from an eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop. That's what movies should be about - they should be there to help people and not glamorize things that are wrong.
