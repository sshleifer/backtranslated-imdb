When I rented this movie, I thought about watching a horror movie. However, there is little horror in this typical 1970s mystery drama directed by the weird James T. Flocker. The friendly Matt Boston loads the image with its great presentation and the typical strange atmosphere of the movies of Flocker is all present.
