Good evening Mr. Tom is so beautifully filmed and wonderfully accomplished. Not completely true to the book, but does it have to be? No, not at all. John Thaw is mesmerizing as Tom Oakley. His transformation from rude to affection was so well performed, making it more believable than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, this is Thaw's best moment. He was fervently reciprocated by a young Nick Robinson, who made a compelling portrait of an evacuee traumatized by his abusive relationship with his mother. The script and the music were worth the purchase, and you also saw Thaw playing the organ. Amazing! The most poignant scene was Willie discovering Zak's death and then telling Tom about his deceased family who died of scarlet fever. Buy this, you'll love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
