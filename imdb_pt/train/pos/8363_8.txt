This is one of the best classic films by Edgar Wallace of the German series - he presents all the basics for a crime film Wallace very entertaining since the 60's: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, be missing you still have the young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, again starring as the typical American 'womanizer', you have the young Eddi Arendt in his role (and typical) - the cool and sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young) Lowitz as the investigator of the melancholic police, but very "dry" ironic (and therefore very entertaining). In addition, you'll have an extravagant and eccentric 'evil face' behind a frog mask (hence the title of the movie!), You'll have a rocking soundtrack, classic B-movie action scenes, filmed in part. (remember, remember the time of its origin!), screaming cries of queens, and so on ... All these ingredients are shaken in a sweet cocktail of German taverns Edgar Wallace - highly recommended !!
