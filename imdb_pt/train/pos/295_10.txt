Bogdonovich's (mostly) undisclosed classic is a film unlike any other. A movie that feels like a fairy tale, but it has a solid foundation in reality because of the use of authentic Manhattan locations and the "true" geography, perhaps the best NYC shooting I've ever seen. John Ritter reminds us that with good directors (Bogdanovich, Blake Edwards, Billy Bob) he can be brilliant, and the whole group is a group that you really wish to exist so that you could spend time with them. One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that does not seem to be a copy of something else, this is the high point of Bogdanovich's fertile "success" career, when his best work was actually done ("saint jack", "finally. .. "," noises off ".
