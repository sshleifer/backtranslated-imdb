I was a fan of the series as a child and after that always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made the difference in the early 1980s compared to previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait une fois l ' Homme ... most of whom I love). I think other similar Japanese cartoons of this type, released later, can not equate to Mazinger Z, since they started repeating the same pattern. <br /> <br /> That same thing, the novelty, may be one of the best. features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is his inventiveness, with so many extravagant monsters, strange devices and bizarre characters; In fact, we were eager to see every new installment to find out what kind of new demon or bad machine was waiting for us!
