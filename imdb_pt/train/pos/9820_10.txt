This is very good, made for TV movie. It describes problems in the suburbs around 1970 and the kind of neighbors we certainly do not want to have around. The worst and most disturbing part of the movie was when teenage punks killed the family dog. Teens do everything to disturb and harass this poor family. But boy, the main character takes revenge on teenage punks in the end. The parent / homeowner certainly does not take all the aggravation of punk teenagers slightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is. He rises against them and protects his home and his family. A very good actor ... I might add. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV when I was 8 or 9 years old. I've never seen it again on TV and would like to see it. Definitely a good one! It's the kind of movie that a person can watch on a Monday night to Friday night and can not stop watching or an afternoon movie on a weekend. It's the kind they just do not show anymore. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing!
