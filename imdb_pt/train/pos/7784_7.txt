It was fab! The photography, editing, cinematography, music combined to transport us to the dangerous side of a tourist destination. It was the pleasure of slumming, without going through the danger. We were there! The dream sequences and the end of the flashback sequence were cool. Talked to me. Stay up the good work! Another of this kind is City of God. Also - do not laugh! - The Comedy, Desperately Seeking Susan. Nice ensemble types, with great performances by all. Sorry, I think Training Day fits that genre too, with fantastic cast performances. I had to change the channel in some of the brave sequences, but all in all, a great movie!
