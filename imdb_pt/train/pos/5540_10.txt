At first, this movie looks so bad that I almost fell into a trance the first time I saw it. It was like a bad nightmare. A cosmic hole. But I gave him a second chance, then another, and so on ... I finally became addicted to this movie, due to its slow pace, wonderful natural scenery, bathed in a soft autumn light and especially by the soundtrack, which is composed of progressive rock from the 70s and absolutely exquisite folk songs of actor / singer / songwriter. Derek Lamb (the troubadour). You should note the song about hazelnut wood, silver trout and lady disappearing into the air ..., heard in the middle and near the end of the movie. There are some carnal scenes at the beginning, which allow us to appreciate the natural charms of Elizabeth Suzuki. If the film had been made by some "repertoire" directors such as Bergman, Lars Von Triers or Jean-Luc Goddard, critics would have rolled on the floor, raving about the film as if they were a cosmic masterpiece. Personally, I think this movie is a million times superior to any of Fellini's movies sh # Â¤ @ t! Definitely not for the pretentious.
