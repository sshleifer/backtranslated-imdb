I just came back from a "My Left Foot" exhibit at our public library. What an emotional experience - I feel drained and elevated. <br /> <br /> It's the story of Christy Brown, Irish writer and painter, and based on the author's autobiography "My Left Foot." Christy was born with a form of cerebral palsy in such a way that the only member he had good control of was his left foot. Doctors advised his parents that he was hopelessly mentally retarded, but his mother did not give up on him and, just as Annie Sullivan did with Helen Keller, helped him achieve a breakthrough in which he learned the alphabet and then read, write, and paint. <br /> <br /> This film won the Oscar for Daniel Day-Lewis (best actor) and best supporting actress for the actress who plays her mother; He also received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, while many movies can entertain me, many also let me overlook Fictions or improprieties in realistic psychological reactions. <br /> <br /> It is not this movie - it was absolutely "visible" in portraying typical Irish roles and paternal behavior (see, for example, typical Irish families in "Ethnicity & McGoldrick"). As well as Christy Brown's uneven emotional maturation - some immature personality reactions that were further amplified by her father's characteristics. The film presents the greater truth as it changes certain sequences in its development (painting and writing) and condensation of several important persons into a person, for the sake of telling a coherent and compelling story, not burdened with small, disturbing, and less important realities. (See Christy Brown on Wikipedia for more accuracy.) The DVD version shown to us had some English subtitles that helped a lot to understand Christy's speech (& some of the Irish lines), the initial release of the movie may have been missing. (If you see this on DVD, enable this option.) <br /> < Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is one of the largest and most dependable acting jobs I've ever seen. Truly magnificent, excellent, superlat "My Left Foot" has more than a resemblance to a more recent film, "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly," in which each one portrays the life of a real person. successfully overcoming the arrest and isolation of an extremely severe physical handicap. <br /> <br /> And in doing so, it resonates with Invictus, by William Ernest Henley, which begins: "Out of the night that covers me, // Black as the pole-to-pole well, / to all the gods who may be // by my unconquerable soul.
