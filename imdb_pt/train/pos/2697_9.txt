Nothing revolutionary here; only cinema impeccably elegant and restrained. <br /> <br /> GARDE VUE is confined almost exclusively to a monotonous police station, and especially to an interrogation room, but to director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET DISEASE, among others) interspersed glimpses spares from exterior paintings such as minimalist local scenography. Miller's restraint, especially at first, is breathtaking, and his exquisite handling of the decisive inner mise-en-scene makes the vision captivating. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is superb as always, managing to legitimize a character. which, on paper, is clich√©: the laconic, hard-working, and tired of the world homicide detective. Ventura lives the role, making it completely believable, even if the script allows us little access to its inner workings; the film ends at the very moment when it seems that he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault is equal to the task as the child-killer suspect who artfully pursues with the single-killer. Minded flic. The exchanges between the two are more often than non-tension pregnancies and the aura of a game field constantly metamorphosed into a battle of intelligence. Serrault's character is, in turn, deplorably arrogant and cunning and deplorable; GARDE VUE's "message," if we look for one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressure that makes a police officer excessively zealous. If necessary, close the cases at the expense of justice. Most of the time, the film shines as nothing more than an example of how to turn a potentially soporific scenario into a suspense drama of the film economy. <br /> <br />
