Moe and Larry are newly henpeck husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. In her music studio, Shemp learns that he will inherit a fortune by marrying someone! "Careful Husbands" is a remake of 1947's "Brideless Groom," considered by many to be one of Stooge's best films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the movie footage. The new scenes, filmed on May 17, 1955, include the plot of Moe and Larry marrying the sisters of Shemp, along with the cooking of a turkey mixed with turpentine! Some new scenes are also placed at the end of the movie (a double for Dee Green has been used; if you blink, you will lose the double appearance). "Careful Husbands" would have made for a good movie with just the plot of marrying the sisters. Budgetary considerations, coupled with fewer reserves for two-cylinder comedies, have influenced the decision to use old images. <br /> <br /> Although completely new films are still being made by the Stooges, most of their 1955-56 releases were made up of older films with some new releases. "Husband Care" while one of these hybrids is watchable and fun; we get to see most of "Brideless Groom" again, and the new scenes are funny enough to take the viewer through the movie. This film is one of Stooge's latest comedies to feature new images of Shemp, and was released six weeks after his death. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
