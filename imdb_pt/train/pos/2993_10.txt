In addition to the usual stereotypes of the 1930s, Eugene Pallette as a rude detective, Jack La Rue as the Italian "moreno," and of course James Lee as "The Chinese Cook," this movie is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room . For a movie from the early 1930s, this step-by-step "stripping the veneer of mystery" is similar to the COLUMBO series, except in this movie, you do not have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance.
