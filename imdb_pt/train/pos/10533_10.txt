I totally agree that "Nothing" is a fantastic movie! I do not laugh a lot when I watch a movie for a long time! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic at it! they really work well together! This movie may not please some people (I can not say why not spoil it!), But each one for itself! I loved it and highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The direction is great and some of the scenes are very intelligent. It seems they may have had a lot of fun filming! <br /> <br /> Although there are only two main characters in the film and not a huge amount of props, the actors manage to get them to make the movie enjoyable to watch.
