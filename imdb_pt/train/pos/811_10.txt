When I think of Return of the Jedi, I think epic. Yes Ewoks were there so what? They are an interesting addition to the film (not to mention that they are similar to the Vietcong who were also able to overthrow a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (played by incredible stage actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the film. Palpatine is so mean and cruel that Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what an incredible ending to such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern Greek tragedy and I think people now can especially understand and appreciate it after Revenge of the Sith came out. Your redemption in the end was moving and really brings a happy and bittersweet feeling to you. The best part was, of course, the special effects. It's amazing how an early 80's movie can still stand the test of time with its graphics. The scenes in Jabba's palace (Leia looks incredible in that metal bikini) and of course the three-way epic battle in the end are still impressive to look at. In all the deep plots and emotional moments of the Jedi (especially between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Lucas reveals the truth to Leia) and incredible special effects is an appropriate end to one of the most beloved franchises in film history.
