Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narration, but nothing worse for that. Downbeat (in a petty-bourgeois way), philosophical and darkly humorous, the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like an intellectual plus Charles Bukowski (no disrespect to CB's intention). Bitterly funny, but also a grim analysis of social and sexual relationships, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognizable way that makes you wonder: why are not there other movies like that? One of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good movie.
