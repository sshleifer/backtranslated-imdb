This is not a love song. <br /> <br /> My one word summary of this movie would be 'Excellent'. Probably not going to appeal to the mass-movie audience? It's a movie that forces you to participate. You observe, think, and question. <br /> <br /> Comparisons can be made with Deliverance (Topic / Theme) and perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for the overall style of filming. <BR> <BR> However, this movie is unique against both. <br /> <br /> Cinematographic effects (solarization, freezing, blurring, etc.) have been seen before but are most effectively used in this film to sustain the natural tension of the story. <br /> <br /> The act is raw, threatening and totally believable. <br /> <br /> The real theme of the film is about friendship; the title really gives the game away. It's probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced or really would like to have. <br /> <br /> It's a love song.
