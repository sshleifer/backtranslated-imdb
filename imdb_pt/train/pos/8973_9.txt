I saw this movie as a child on television (thank the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and I had nightmares about it for years afterwards. <br /> <br /> Trnka was one of the mentors to Bratislav Pojar, one of the Canadians. Best animators of the National Film Board. Pojar was, in turn, mentor and collaborator of the great Drouin. If you like Trnka you should see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The symbolism is obvious, but cleverly used. Opposites of beauty and life (the plant) are placed in opposition to the anonymity of the gloved hand. The poor puppet hero is condemned despite the lack of political agenda. <br /> <br /> What I remember most was the feeling of oppression in the decor. The small room where the action takes place is the whole world of the character. Invasion by the hand is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and haunted movie. I found a copy of this and other wonderful trnka shorts in the public library and showed it to my own children. A must see.
