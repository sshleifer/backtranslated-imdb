I have this one a few weeks ago and I love it! It is modern, light, but full of true complexities of life. Questions and answers, as well as other Eytan Fox movies. This is my favorite, along with Jossi and Jagger. This portrays much more universally than just the bubbles in which we can live. You do not have to be Jewish or homosexual to like this - I'm not, but the film goes directly to my top ten films. At first it seems pure entertainment, but it makes you think more. Relationships that we have to live with are superficial, meaningful, profound, fatal, you choose. You do not know what's coming, and you definitely do not know where this story is going as you watch it for the first time. Worth seeing several times. Fox films include great bonus material - here's a great music video and "making of" (including the title explanation, interviewing Lior Ashknenazi, who plays himself in the film and Arabs with doubts about Israel's lifestyles).
