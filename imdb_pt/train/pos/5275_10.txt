This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a movie portraying Muslims as PEOPLE, with no stereotypes here. This film is driven by history, acting and, above all, by its theme, cultural affirmation and discovery. They may sound cliches, but they are not, at least not in this movie. The view of the Great Mosque of Mecca is absolutely stupendous and the public has a glimpse of one side of the Muslim world that is rarely shown in the West. Here people are caring, supportive, devoted, tolerant and dedicated to one another. What a welcome and long overdue departure from the negative portrayals of the Arabs. Great movie.
