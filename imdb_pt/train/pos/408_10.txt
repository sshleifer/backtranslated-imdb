I can not tell you how much I love this movie. I've read comments that say this movement is "too confusing" or "how to swim in concrete drying". I say these reviewers have no imagination! For those who love Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you've ever enjoyed playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you, (especially if you're interested in Oriental adventures). I'm sorry I have not seen this movie on the big screen. (Just more encouragement to get my own big screen t.v. :-)
