DAVID TOMLINSON'S MEMORY OF LOVE (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie, I was 4 and I was fascinated by this witch story in World War II. The scene that struck me most was the struggle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to combat the haunted singing their march. This movie is fantastic, from the trip to Portobello Road (which has become for me the most fantastic place in London) for the trip to Naboomboo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are truly a fantastic couple. She is always great, looks like the good aunt of a family and David with her face always astonished is her great co-protagonist. We will miss you so much.
