This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We had several friends for one night and for some reason or another we surfed on HBO for the night. Someone by the name of "Eddie Izzard" was on. I tried not to laugh too loudly at the first jokes. I did not want to be considered "responsible" by the rest of the group for something that was obviously killing me. After holding on to my laughter for more than I was healthy, I let go - just like the others of us (we were not stoned, by the way, nor talking about insurance and pensions ...). We were suffocated after that. The story lines, the plot, the bizarre and ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing less than brilliance. Since then I've been addicted to all of Eddie-Izzard's comedy pieces that I can get my hands on. Your work is pure genius. His comedy seems effortless. He seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out in his house and rambling about this or that ... It's convulsively funny. He gives you the impression that the joke is between you ... and himself, the only true humor aficionados, after all. If you are disappointed with this video, you have no notion of the penultimate in humor - or humor, as they say in the UK.
