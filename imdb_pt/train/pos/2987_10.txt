This is the whiner that the beaches never were. As much as I wanted to love Beaches, it always seemed too rushed for me to "feel" for it (its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums). Stella, on the other hand, moves at a slower (and occasionally very slow) pace, and although it is somewhat manipulative in her tearful story about a self-sacrificial mother, it works because Bette and the rest of the cast present themselves in large performances. . 10/10
