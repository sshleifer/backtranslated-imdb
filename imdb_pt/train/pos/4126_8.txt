What night. Perry Mason then got Gun, Will Travel followed by Gunsmoke (with half an hour left) and finally at 10:30 in the afternoon came 'Sea Hunt' with his wonderful opening song and Mike's boat leaving for a new adventure. Great ... Regardless of the story, it was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest and sincere. A man of man and a man of boy. This brought an interest in boats that lasted for years. Why do not they show in cable or make it available on video, have no idea .. Too bad.
