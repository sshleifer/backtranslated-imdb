I saw in the guide of the list of films of the Festival of Cinema of Santa BÃ¡rbara, where I was when in Hollywood, that this film was on display. Basically, there is an election for the new chairman of the Hong Kong Tri Sing Society of Hong Kong, so you can imagine how much violence will occur during the event. The fight is between the "candidates" Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai) for the control of the oldest and most powerful parts of the Triad society. Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are some good themes and moments of realist corruption, just enough action, plus, maybe, when the cops get involved, but a sequel ensues, so it's a worthy crime drama thriller. Very good!
