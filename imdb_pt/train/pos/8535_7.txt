This work is a bold look at the mentality of men who find themselves in wheelchairs. This film never tries to tone down, soft cotton or mild soap, the anguish, confusion and pain with which these guys live. That's your strength, I guess. <br /> <br /> But even more, the performances are fantastic, with well-designed and delivered dialogue that draws you and makes you feel part of the experience. The characters never try to block the audience from knowing what's on their mind, what's in their hearts. <br /> <br /> I thought it was difficult, but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The rate is 6.6 / 10 of ... <br /> The Devil :.
