I saw as many times as I could before I left the scene. A delightful and fun movie with some of my favorite stars. I just wish I could meet you again! Certainly buy / see if I could. Please, somebody, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during World War II, and his main ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was a musical but also romantic, fun and intelligent. This was my favorite movie starring June Haver, although I always liked it. His dazzling smile lit up the screen, and his beauty and talent were a trump card for any movie. The support cast lent credit to their individual roles. A well-balanced and lightweight film; Just wish we had more like it!
