I found The FBI Story pretty amusing and adequately optimistic for my New Year's holiday vision. His dramas and action-packed episodes were thrilling. The character Hardesty was well designed and admirable. Overall, the photography, the script and the direction were perfectly meritorious. Instead of making the film a disgusting piece of propaganda, as some did, I liked it as a well-balanced portrait of the need for ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the description of a family uniting, even under the pressure of the husband's commitment to his (debatable) important work, did not find a fertile, but ideal, exemplary representation.
