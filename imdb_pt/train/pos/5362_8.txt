THE RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, this is not 2001, but it's not meant to be. And the acting and script here is not the same as other Arnie films like PREDATOR or THE TERMINATOR. But I suggest that the IDEIA behind this movie is one of the coolest of all time to play on the big screen. A state-sponsored game show in which felons convicted of serious crimes compete against "heroic" stalkers armed with all kinds of weapons (runners do not have any) to satisfy public craving for sport and blood. The biggest prize for a winning runner: freedom. Or else the rules state. <br /> <br /> For a movie with exaggerated bloody scenes and short phrases, it really has a lot to say. Someone else has pointed out all the culture / government comments featured in this movie, so I will not go in here. Suffice it to say that if you can see beyond the seemingly silly feel of the movie, you will like it a lot (especially if you're a big fan of science fiction with a lot of imagination). As I said, it's not trying to be a serious art film, but it's surprisingly a 1980s shoot-in-the-block movie. The premise borrows from a short novel by Richard Bachman (also known as Stephen King), but diverges quite heavily from their original material, especially in the end. (The book ends in a very nihilistic way, needless to say, this movie is not.) I like both, but I like the movie better. <br /> <br /> My favorite phrase: "I think it's caused by steroids."
