The Unborn is a good low budget horror film that explores the fears associated with pregnancy. She is very well represented by the always good Brooke Adams and the faithful James Karen, although the supporting cast is quite average for a first-grader. The music, by Gary Numan of all people, is also good. Henry Dominic's script is pretty clever for this sort of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. The direction of Rodman Fender is just adequate, and there are some cheap scares unnecessary. If you're a fan of Adams, whose movie career is not nearly as illustrious as it should be, check it out; she is great, as always.
