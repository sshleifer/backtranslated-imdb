A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be rewarded for the effort. "Holes" does not make the same mistakes you would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers in a camp. For the first time, events are not explained in detail. Flashback scenes really serve a purpose and feature several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a little dismayed by the seriousness of the film. But I soon realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. Aside from the story, this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional settings. (An example where Cave Man is prohibited from teaching Zero to read because they have to dig holes to build a character, as learning to read does not contribute to this). "Holes" is a clever and beautiful film. A must watch!
