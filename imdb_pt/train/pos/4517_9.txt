With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap pictures. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does a great job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you care deeply about and as a result, feels his suffering trying to live as much as Gerald as Geraldine. Not only that, but like Geraldine, he looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel love for each other, and this happens even when they simply look over the breakfast table. Even the potentially tacky sub-story line of corporate acquisitions is believable, and you see yourself cheering in the end! At least I did!
