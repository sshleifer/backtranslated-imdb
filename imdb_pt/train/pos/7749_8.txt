This movie takes you off the ground. This debut film by Tom Barman (well-known from Belgian rock band dEUS) features 8 intriguing people, building blocks of a convincing mosaic of films. Each of them survives a day and a night in the metropolis of Antwerp. Barman paints his characters with great enthusiasm and competently interacts with his individual stories, a power tour that resembles the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson. The patchwork of anecdotes surprises, moves, amuses; the dialogues are so natural that they seem improvised. Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and the extremely entertaining duo of Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt. Sam Louwyck is the memorable "Windman", a bizarre guy dancing throughout the film. Sam is also responsible for the impressive choreography and, of course, Tom Barman himself took care of the ultra cool soundtrack. We were seriously impressed: Any Way The Wind Blows is a movie that gets you off your feet.
