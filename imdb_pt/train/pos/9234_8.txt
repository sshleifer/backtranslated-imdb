Reporting based on actual historical events, this epic disturbingly violent, bloody and shocking epic sustains the viewer's interest by creating a verisimilitude absent in most films set in a remote era. Mrs. Bolkan's portrait of the rebellious nun is a tour de force. His gradual transformation into the character of an obedient compliant, though involuntary, in the social injustices of his day is evidently demonstrated by counted sequences: his testimony of the hated activity of Duke's local rapper, his forbidden love affair with a Jew, his criminal desertion to the Muslim invasion. In this film there are some painfully realistic bloody sequences that are not for the most sensitive, but spectators with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history must find broad interest. It deserves to be seen, if only as an antidote to the Hollywood representations of the medieval world.
