I thought this was a wonderful movie. It touches all the fibers of a human being. The love in the movie is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance so far. Great direction. I liked the issue. The music was great. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie that everyone should go see. I hope people get something wonderful out of it. Overall, great movie. I think Hollywood should make more movies with substance. Even action movies can have a love affair. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting. He had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. I suggest watching this alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I discovered that the world stopped and my only focus was on the movie. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world. And with this generation I was great to see something (someone) who cared for other people more than himself.
