Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his great opportunity. Meanwhile, he works as a telephone consultant for a psychic hotline in Manhattan. One day, unfortunately, your apartment building is on fire. Parker and his cat leave alive, but now they are stuck in the arduous task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. It comes to Parker that a lady, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but only accepts a gay man. As Parker is straight, but the price is fair, he decides to pretend to be gay. Samantha likes him from the beginning and welcomes him as his new companion. But poor Parker. Sam is adorable, intelligent and very desirable. How will he be able to keep his true nature in control? Besides, Sam does not have a successful entrepreneur, anyway? This is a sweet, friendly and humorous movie with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, the plot is a sequence of "how can I keep this trick" scenes, with Sam asking Parker to shampoo while she is showering or asking her to hold her in bed when she gets bad news. In addition, it is necessary for Parker to produce his own "false" gay partner, Boris, when Sam insists on fixing him with a man she knows. I hope the gay community does not find this very offensive, since this viewer felt that most of the problems were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. For a small-scale film, the costumes, the sets and the camera work were also very good. So if you love these funny love tales, get this one soon enough. You'll like what you see, I know that.
