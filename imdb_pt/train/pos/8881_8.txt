First, you have to take into account the length of time this movie was made. 1995. The rappers were in it, and that added to his talent. Remy was a socially clumsy teenager trying to find his way and could not, until he met and was helped by the Nazis. They accepted him. The Nazis are not that strange, but, like most gangs, they fill a void that is lacking, be it economic, social, emotional, anything. Michael Rappaport played the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps was the star of athletics, with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder. He kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his suffering, and had his girlfriend and teacher to straighten him out about it. <br /> <br /> Kristen was a young white woman trying to find herself and trying to fit in until she was raped. She then found her own experience with her sexuality and became politically involved. <br /> <br /> This film deals with racism and, like most things that deal with racism, people's own perspectives come into play. <br /> I read many comments about how there were no 'evil' black characters, but there was an evil white (Nazis). And? Remy was not portrayed as an evil, he was trying to find his way, and continued to fail until some skinheads accepted him. He was afraid, it was sad to see him return as he did. He even says before committing suicide, I did not mean it, I wanted to be an engineer. Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes were angry black men, Ice Cube was a bit intellectual, and Busta Rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug. Both have shown no regard for their roommates, and generally do not seem to like whites much. They were angry like the Nazis, but not at the Nazi level in terms of malice in general. Sorry if that makes it seem unfair, but are there really black groups like the Nazis? No. People say it shows white = -good = good. Not true, the only bad white characters were the Nazis and the police, which is more or less true in real life. Kristen was a good girl, her boyfriend (roommate omar epps) was a nice guy, and even Remy was a nice guy, he was just wrong. <br /> <br /> Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Busta were seriously imperfect characters angry and reckless. Although his constant harassment by the police seemed to justify some of their anger. Remy's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well. <br /> <br /> Good movie, well done. Like all movies dealing with racism, it's a great piece to start a discussion. <br /> <br /> I do not think Cube and Busta could beat the Nazis.
