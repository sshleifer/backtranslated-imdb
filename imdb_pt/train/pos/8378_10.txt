What a great movie that is. The notion of nations sending people struggling with giant robots is corny. The end is not only appropriate, it is more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm intrigued by the characters. It's a shame we never see Achilles and Athena's relationship more developed beyond just a few kisses and Athena's fear of Achilles' safety. Your novel is very enjoyable. <br /> <br />
