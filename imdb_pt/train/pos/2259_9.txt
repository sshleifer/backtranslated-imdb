I bought this cheap from the remaining rental at our local store. It was almost in perfect condition, and I had never heard of it before. Of course, no one else did. <br /> <br /> I can not believe my luck. You go through the realm of emotions and try to overcome a complex message - the moral and non-triumphal posture of the Mandela Party, no doubt. Despite its enormous length (I had to watch it in two sessions) - it was like a book that could not be placed. Maybe the songs are not so memorable, but the spirit of the thing shines forever. I can not understand the comments that a musical (clearly designed for stage) is not realistic! I've seen "South Pacific" and read the book too, and I can assure you the musical is not realistic compared to the book. I'll cherish this little find until it's over. One day they will do it again with a better budget. <br /> <br />
