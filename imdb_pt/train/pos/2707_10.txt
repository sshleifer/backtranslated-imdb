Color damn. This movie really surprised me because it is a comedy masterpiece. Billy Zane is awesome as the central character, and everyone can interpret it right enough that the comedy is natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good, and the scenery is a joy to see. I recommend you watch this movie with a lot of friends, a few bottles of your drink of choice, and get ready to be surprised and very entertained. <br /> <br /> This continues as perfectly with kitsch masterpieces as Plan 9 of the Outer Space which is in the true tradition of the movie "B". But what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who participated in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find myself laughing at the scene where Zane descends a series of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. All a little crazy and better for that.
