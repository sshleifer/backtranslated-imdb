"Mr. Harvey lit a candle" is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> Although we can predict that your grumpy, rigid teacher will have some kind of rupture or catharsis based on some deep secret from his past, how his emotions are revealed is amazing. Spall's range of feelings conveyed is quite touching and more than he usually portrays as part of Mike Leigh's repertoire. Although an expected tedious school bus ride was used only for comedic purposes, "The Simpsons," this central location of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in the Rhidian Brook script is well restrained and structured for dramatic purposes, and is almost formally divided into acts. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to the A British urban range of racially and religiously diverse children (with their uniforms I could not tell if this is a "private" or "public" school), how do they get together ?? the black rap boys, the South Asians and the serious Muslims, the white bullies and the mean girls? but transmitted in a very natural and individual way. The young actors, some of whom I recognized from British TV as "No Shame", were lush to represent the usual range of junior social pressures. Celia Imrie puts more heat into the role of the supervisor than the jacks she usually has to play. <br /> <br /> A break in the journey leads to a transformative crisis for some, while others remain amusedly forgotten. We think, like the professor portrayed by Ben Miles of Coupling, that we will be fed a didactic lesson on religious tolerance, but it is much more about faith in people as well as God, and that is why the BBC showed this in England Na Easter time, BBC America showed this in the US over Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was also so good at "Summer of Love," plays a key role in Harvey's redemption that might have been played for the movie preaching of the week, but is playing when they they approach each other in an unexpected way (unfortunately I saw the intense scene interrupted by commercials). <br /> <br /> Although it is a bit of heavy hands, on several occasions calling this car trip a "pilgrimage," this quiet film was the best evocation of "good will toward men" than I saw in most Christmas-themed TV movies.
