Wow, this movie had a huge impact on me, it thrilled me. It's an incredible story about a girl in Cambodia sold to the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the girl named Holly. The setting of the film is realistic, the film was an eye opener, I can not imagine anyone walking away from it without wanting to help make a change with this gruesome problem that exsists. <br /> <br /> The content of the film the film was very exciting. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. A girl who plays Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film has brought me to tears, He tells an important message that needs to be heard around the world. Everyone should go see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
