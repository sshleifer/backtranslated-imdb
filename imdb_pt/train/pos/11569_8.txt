Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" invades seven minutes of crazy action from a very small premise. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself, he will again be given a terrible bath. Unfortunately for the dog, a relentless flea makes it almost impossible to stop scratching. The cartoon alternates between the progress of the flea inside the dog's fur and the desperate attempts of the dog to deal with it. In a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can not be scratched, the dog changes color from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to chess! It sounds ridiculously surreal, but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feel of an itch in a way that only Clampett could. There are several other elements that make Clampett 'An Itch in Time' pure. There is the grotesque concept itself, which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog's flesh. There is unbridled violence that appears in any scene that shows the cat. Most notably, there are the dirty jokes, including a huge photo of the dog that makes the flea whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog tries to scratch himself by dragging his butt across the floor. He interrupts momentarily to speak to the audience, "I'd better cut it, I might like it!" With a very limited concept, Clampett manages to make 'An Itch in Time' a unique cartoon based on minutiae. As an early episode of 'Seinfeld', 'An Itch in Time' is pretty much nothing but pretty funny about it.
