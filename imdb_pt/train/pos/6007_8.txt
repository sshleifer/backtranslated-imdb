If you have not heard of this Walt Disney Pictures movie, do not worry about it. He would be ranked over the other Disney movies that are intended for educational purposes, such as "Family Planning." <br /> <br /> It was co-produced with Kotex to teach pre-teen girls about Menstruation, supposedly. It only educates on a superficial level, so it does not go into heavy detail for the animated sequence of the "Ram's Head" / Reproductive System. <br /> <br /> The movie shows elements of "The Wonderful World of Disney" as turning the page and using animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to find, so if you can find the movie, better luck to you and enjoy yourself.
