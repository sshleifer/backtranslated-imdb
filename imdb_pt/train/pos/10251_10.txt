I'm surprised that many viewers have more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie ... I've seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best. <br /> <br /> Even though I've seen the "making of", I still have doubts about watching those 35 minutes of pure torture: it's so powerful. <br /> <br /> A 10 out of 10 because this movie has perfectly achieved what it set out to do: be the best snuff film ever made.
