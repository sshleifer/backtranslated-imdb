Lost is the best TV series out there. First of all, it has great actors and wonderful direction. Writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary, but after the third season writing became highly complex. Who is Jacob? Why are there polar bears on the island? What is the fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people think that writers are lost and they have raised many questions and mysteries that they can not explain. I believe these people are wrong. I have confidence in the writers. I think if the mysteries are revealed from now on the whole. charm of the series goes away. Anyway, lost is undeniably the largest TV series and will continue to be for a long time.
