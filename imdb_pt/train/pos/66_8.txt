"Home Room" came as a total surprise. Not having the slightest idea what it was, it was worth it because he did not punch and what we see is how lives are changed by the act of a disgruntled young man who has decided to victimize his classmates, who are the innocent victims of his hastily actions. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director, who is working and editing his own material, is a talented man who is rewarded for some incredible acting around his cast. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate from high school. She has been missing for some years and does not seem to be on the same wavelength as other students. On the one hand, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to get close to their orbit. Alicia was among the students in the living room, where nine students were killed, reportedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we realize, is a wounded girl who has gone through a terrible ordeal in her life, but we are given no clues to that effect. <br /> <br /> What follows is the result of the tragedy, as it focuses on a young woman who survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teenager who should not have been in school. When a bouncing bullet hits her, she is hospitalized with more than one wound. She is trying to overcome this dark period in her mind, but the nightmares will not let her forget. <br /> <br /> Alicia is forced to go to the hospital by the principal of the school. Since she does not cooperate with the police, the headmaster wants her to see Deanna in her dreadful state and maybe she will soften and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia does not like Deanna, but in a matter of days, the two girls will make up. We did not realize until the last sequence what really happened on that horrible day at school. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips makes a great Alicia and Erika Christiansen is as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland, and the rest of the cast play. The film has an intensity because it is not explicit in showing how the shootings occurred, which helps in the tone that mr. Ryan wanted to give this movie.
