This movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices I made and how my life would change if my choices had been different. He plays directly on the theory of the "Multiple Universe". <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not seem true is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) has a hard time understanding what's going on, that everything has changed. <br /> <br />
