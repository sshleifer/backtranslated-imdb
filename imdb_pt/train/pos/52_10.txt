This movie is incredible. If you have the chance, watch. Although, a warning, you will cry your eyes out. I do, every time I see, and I own and watch many times. The performances are excellent. It deals with darkness, pain and loss, but there is hope. This film made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you have seen, notice the interesting use of shadows and light. Home room is a phenomenal movie, and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting, incredible storyline and heartbreaking dialogues. Very tense, very moving. It does not give all the answers, but it does many good points about humanity
