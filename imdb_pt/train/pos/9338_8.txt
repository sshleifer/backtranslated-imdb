It is true that the idea for this TV series may have come from the immense success that Ally McBeal is enjoying all over the world, even here in Germany. However, having said that, Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work wonderfully together. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by the famous German actor Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, understand?), Played by charming Rebecca Immanuel, exchanges quick romantic responses and continuous spying on each other, while participating in criminal cases like sitcom in Berlin and surroundings. In addition, they are aided by a magnificent cast of co-stars, most notably his secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, which is a rare gem with great comedic potential. Also the obscure wheel salesman, Otto, and Felix's noble childhood friend, Frank, work very well, not to forget Sandra's best friend and roommate, Patricia, played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> All in all a joy to watch on Monday nites: it's no wonder that the series and its stars have received multiple awards. Will Felix have Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we have to wait many more episodes to discover ......
