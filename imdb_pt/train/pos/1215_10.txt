This is my favorite of all three movies. Once again I liked all the songs. The big problem, however, as most people pointed out, is that this story contradicts the original. For those who saw the first movie to remember the bears met their "cousins" they apparently never knew. It was not, of course, until the end that the cousins ​​received their belly symbols after proving how much they cared. In this story, however, cousins ​​grow up with care bears and have the belly symbols all the time. That being said, this is not a bad movie, as long as you keep it separate from the first one. I thought the character Darkheart much more evil than the Nicholas of the first. But at the same time, I felt that this added a kind of balance to the sweetness of the teddy bears. I also liked the part we cared for in the end, although I know that other people had mixed feelings about that scene. Of course I LOVED the songs. My favorites are Growing Up and Forever Young. Care has movies that have always had such good music. Ten stars for a really good movie.
